58767,103458,"I have been dating my bf for a while but there are some points that I just cannot shrug off.
The expectation is that a guy should be at least a head taller than his girlfriend, but this is something that can only happen in my dream. The reason is he is only 2cm taller and not even 175cm, meaning that it feels like he is a sister/pal to me rather than an oppa. He is way too short for a guy and it doesnt give me a strong sense of security. I estimate he is in the lower tier of height range perhaps somewhere between 1.70-1.73m.
In fact, I would like to ask my fella ladies out there who are willing to date shorter guys or even marry them. What do you see in them? Dont you regret it after a while or will make this an issue whenever you start quarreling? There are plenty of bigger fishes out there and I am now starting to regret it.
Before you commentors start bashing me, I will be fair and point out some of his merits along with my concerns.
1. Yes, he is pretty good looking and has a nice heart. He often shows care for cats/dogs and feed them but I find this trait less manly and somewhat gross. A real man should be more aggressive, not like a beta sissy that plays with small animals.
2. He often buys lunch for me and brings it to the secondary school where I am teaching. However, sometimes kaypoh students will come to me and ask ""Cher, your boyfriend ah? Legit? Why so short one?""- Not surprising since even my female students are taller than him. This is ridiculously embarassing. I even told my bf not to bring lunch to me but he doesnt get my point... He will just say "" If we are truly in love, we shouldnt care what others say""..... Yeah right you are not the teacher...
3. He will offer to carry the plastic bags whenever we go shopping. The problem is his legs are short so his hands are like in close proximity to the ground, resulting in some long plastic bags being dragged, even though I understand he doesnt mean it. This is pretty unsightly.
4. He is a mathematician and I remembered once he drew me a heart using math equations. This seems romantic to others but lame in my eyes. If he is sincere, he would have drawn the heart by hand, not indulge in these kinds of boring stuff. After all, how can all these math help him in his future prospect? I knew of a few friends already earning big bucks without knowledge of maths.
I do not not wish to elaborate any further because for every merit that I can think of, it is diluted by the negative aspects. They cant even offset his midget stature.
Unfortunately, all the good quality tall guys are already taken by the short girls, otherwise I would have ended this relationship earlier. I do not want my female besties to find out that I broke up, so I will just bear with it for a while.
My message to my fella sisters out there who are currently attached to the shorter guys. It is never too late to back out! Think of your future!

58649,103251,"I've been together with my boyfriend for 3 years. Last year he graduated and found a job that pays him $3.5k a month. To be honest I was shocked that his salary is quite low. Because some of my friends and cousins are earning much higher than him. I often encouraged him to find a better job. I also asked him to take up some courses to improve his chances. He already took up a few courses but he still couldn't find a better job.
Recently, I was bored and downloaded a dating app for fun. Surprisingly, I matched with a lot of guys who seem quite eligible. I even matched with a lawyer and an investment associate. I have been chatting with the investment associate for two weeks now. He would text me only a few times a day because he's a very busy guy. Yesterday was his birthday so he told me he celebrated his birthday with his family at home.
After his birthday celebration, he suddenly said he wants to see me. At around 3am, he snuck out of his house and drove to my house to see me. I went down to the carpark to meet him and was quite surprised to see that he drives a luxury car and he looks even better in real life. We chatted for 2 hours in his car. He then walked me to the lift and even kissed me on my cheek. Although we barely know each other, I actually feel quite happy that he kissed me. When he reached home, he texted me to say that he enjoyed talking to me and he would like to see me again.
He seems like a really nice guy. I know I shouldn't compare but my bf isn't even that nice. And my bf is unable to find a decent job so I'm worried about my future when we get married. But my bf and I have been together for 3 years so our relationship is very stable. I feel like if I break up with him now, 3 years of my life would be wasted. What should I do? Should I just stick to my bf because he is obviously a safer choice? Or should I continue to go out with the investment guy and then break up with my bf when the investment guy confess to me?

57933,101855,"Need to rant. My ex-boyfriend is so cheapskate. Today he suddenly texted me and asked me if I could return him the engagement ring that he proposed to me with.
We dated for 4 years before he proposed to me in August last year. A month later, he quit his job because he wanted to start a business with his friends. I then broke up with him as I felt very disappointed with his stupid start-up dreams. Fortunately I met someone new at my workplace who’s way more mature and financially stable than him so I managed to quickly move on.
So today he told me he would like to sell the engagement ring as he would like to expand his business. I asked him why bother selling this ring as it’s not that expensive anyway. He then said that this ring costs alot to him as he saved up for 2 years to buy it because he knew that it was my dream to own this ring. Playing the sympathy card. Yikes.
To be honest this ring is not really super expensive, at most $60k? So I don’t understand why he is so determined to take it back. I am seriously disgusted with how thick-skinned he is, how he tries so hard to convince me to return him the ring. Somemore he already know that it is my dream to own this ring.
But when I told my friends about this, they all told me I should return him the ring and support him in his start-up dream and then ask my current boyfriend to buy me a new one. Seriously how to support such stupid dream? So should I return him the ring or not? I have the right to reject him right?

58807,103530,"tl;dr: I cheated with my female colleague and I feel very bad about it. What made it worse was that my wife witnessed the cheating…
I'm happily married with a wonderful wife with two kids. I work in marketing in an FMCG company and I'm constantly surrounded by younger female colleagues. Ngl, many of them are very attractive but I'm a faithful man who thinks with his bigger head.
However my life recently turned upside down. There's this female colleague who recently joined, let's call her G. G is in her late twenties and has a face and figure many women would die for and many men would go for. I was so surprised to find out that she was single (she gave me that information without me asking). G would constantly ask me for advice dealing with work matters and invite me to go lunch together with her batch. Sometimes we go for lunches and it's just the two of us. G would constantly ask me what I was doing over the weekend and tell me what her plans were. She was actively using dating apps but none of the guys were up to her standards. She would often flirt with me (I think?) Like when we are alone she would playfully brush my arms and sometimes bump into me (too often for it to be by accident). She’d also tell me about her experiences with her dates and how they're not good, and I'm so much better. I always felt a weird sensation whenever I hear that from her. It’s a nice feeling to be validated, but I’m married and it feels wrong.
One fateful day, as my wife had to use the car that day, she came to my office to pick me up. As I was walking away from the office with my wife, G somehow appeared out of nowhere and said hi to us and was extremely friendly towards my wife. G and my wife started chatting as if they were besties and they somehow ended up organizing a games night at my place that weekend. G said she’d bring her date over.
Fast forward to that day, G came with her date. Not sure why but I felt a tinge of jealousy seeing him. We decided to play some card games and I ended up partnering with G. This is when things went down. G was secretly texting me the cards she had in her hand and signaled me to read my phone. I got the hint and was trying to discreetly look at my phone. However, my wife caught me doing that and snatched my phone away and she saw the message from G. She acted like it was ok but after G and date left, she was so furious that I cheated with G during the games and my wife refuses to talk to me now.
How can I appease my wife?

58900,103714,"I fell for a Siam bu.
Before u guys judge me, please hear me out. I often frequent Thai disco / Siam Diu as a means to de-stress. I find that the loud music and spinning lights help take the stress away from my work.
Like any other visit, I sat at my usual spot when a petite silhouette from afar caught my attention. Her round eyes, sharp nose, and elongated legs is what many would consider ""attractive"". Not to mention that her long and silky hair that is constantly brushing against her shoulder line; any man would subconsciously gravitate toward her and I was no exception.
I could not help but to glance in her direction without making it too obvious. I got caught eventually and we exchanged eye contact for a good 10 seconds. She understood the assignment and came over for a chat. As we began sharing more about each other, I realized that we have many things in common. We immediately clicked as though we had known each other right from the beginning. She introduced herself as ""Moon.""
At that moment, I felt as though I had found my soulmate. Talking to Moon made me forget about my fatigue from work. It was as though time had stopped. Deep down, I was sincerely hoping that the conversation could last forever. Time flew quickly, and before I knew it, the place was closing for the night. We exchanged contact and parted ways.
The next day, my phone rang. On answering, I was greeted by a familiar voice. It was Moon. My face lit up knowing that I could connect with her again. We agreed to meet up at a Thai restaurant called NaNa at Golden mille.
NaNa restaurant is a famous Thai restaurant in SG. Moon claimed to be a frequent patron of the place as their food tasted close to home. She even use the opportunity to teach me the name of the dishes in Thai. Halfway through our meal, she was rudely interrupted by a phone call which led her to leaving the restaurant. She claimed that she had something urgent to attend to, and needed to excuse herself. She sounded anxious.
Feeling concerned, I quickly paid the tab and followed her. I was soon led to one of the floor exits where I found her seated on the stairs and sobbing uncontrollably. I approached her to check on her. My presence caught her off guard and, almost immediately, she apologized for leaving me alone in the restaurant. She then went on to explain what happened. Turns out, her mom was terminally ill, and needed money for her operation. Sympathizing with her plight, I agreed to help her out without much hesitation.
As I was about to get up and make the withdrawal. She grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her. She gave me a peck on my cheek to express her gratitude. Things got heated up and we made love in a public space. Despite the shabby location, the sex was good and memorable. The day ended on a good note with her settling her family matters with my financial support.
That incident pulled us closer as we started hanging out more. Despite numerous warnings from my friends and family about her intention, I chose to believe her as I felt that the society perception towards hostress is based on stereotypes. Things, however, did get dubious when she started asking for more money...
P.S I realized the story is getting too lengthy and I apologized. I'll split the story and post the part two if the post hits 200 likes

58128,102276,"To the guy who used sugarbook, don't bother about what the comments say. Just accept that in this world, men can never win.
If a women post about her sugarbook experience, she is empowering, brave, not constrained by the limits and expectations of society. If a man post about his sugarbook experience, he is a scumbag.
When a man wants to split expenses 50-50, he is calculative, not generous, dump him. When a women wants to split housework 50-50, it is equality.
Just like how guys should mind their own business and not care about what girls wear, why should girls not mind their own business and not care about how guys spend their money.
In this day and age, equality is only used when it suits the narrative of females, otherwise it is why are you not gentlemanly enough.

I can’t stand such a mummy’s boy & honestly it’s a my dealbreaker for me if I’d known about his habit when we were dating. I visit my in-laws once to two times a week. It’s not like they can’t update each other then. Rmb it’s not emergency stuff that they’re updating each other everyday. She also doesn’t have major health issues.
She is very reliant on him on everything. She & her husband are moving to an estate close to us soon & I’m worried my hubby will run every small errand his parents esp. his mother asks of him simply because he chats with her everyday. His mother asks him to do errands even when they live far apart, not to mention when they move near to us.
Guys, do you call your mum everyday to update her about your day. I’m a girl and I don’t even do that! It’s creepy.
I’ve sounded this out to him by saying, ‘How come your mum calls you everyday?’ But he thinks nothing of it & doesn’t get the hint that I’m disgusted by it. How can I make it clearer to him that he & his mum’s call routine is creepy? He may just hide, call & whisper in the toilet if I make it any more obvious. Sorry, their kind of co-dependency sh*t & intimacy just borders on incest even though it’s not. It’s simply not healthy.

58793,103506,"Manly guys should be hairy - that has been my opinion since puberty, so I have never shaved in my life, and I admire my armpit hair at least once a day in front of the mirror. I like exercising topless at parks and gyms, where I spend most of my time at the pull-up bars so I can flaunt my hairy armpits and make manly grunts that would arouse the opposite s**. However, the number of girls who would look lustfully in my direction has diminished over the years to an alarming zero.
To combat this, recently I have taken to frequenting nearby 7-11s after my workout, giving a free show of my topless sweaty body to any surrounding females. I even raise my arms in the pretense of stretching so that they can enjoy an unimpeded view of my erotic armpits, but even the cashier avoided my gaze. I don't know what else I can do apart from bellowing out loud: ""BEHOLD MY MANLY ARMPIT HAIR!""
Are girls these days brainwashed by those hairless feminine sissies from BTS and other Kpop boybands to the extent that they no longer appreciate a proper manly, hairy male?

It's settled."" Unfortunately, his outstretched arm featured a ginormous ARMPIT STAIN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Things escalated from there and now I’m unable to stop myself. We click very well and i think there’s a big attraction between us.
We do keep our personal moments off from the family time. When it comes to her work and household chores she takes care of everything very well. She has never taken advantage of the situation and failed to work properly because of our affair.
The problem is i think my mum (staying with us) sensed something recently and ever since she has been insisting on sending our helper back home. She keeps finding fault with her which was not the case in the past. I really don’t want her to be sent back as this is not her fault. She has a family to feed back home and i feel very guilty.
But I can’t speak about this to anyone. I can’t even bring myself to ask my friends for advice. I’m also very worried that my mum might say something about this to my husband. Till date he hasn’t sensed anything and I didn’t deprive him of anything because of what i get with our helper. But I’m just very scared and worried.

The justifications are as follows:
1. They dont have a child yet
2. I am a blackbelt in karate and I fear no threats. The more one pushes me, the more I will resist.
3. She might be in an abusive relationship given her husband's tone, I need to save her from this toxic relationship.
4. I am not young anymore and good single girls are almost extinct. Mostly are attached to the tall and tanned guys ( who arent even as educated as I ???) I cant trust the millenial girls nor SPGs.

58648,103256,"My girlfriend and I met in the first year of uni. when I first lay my eyes on her, I knew she was the one. However, there was only one problem: she was attached. But I was going to overcome this hurdle nonetheless, afterall we were studying in an overseas uni and her boyfriend was in the army. I knew I could come in between their LDR - it was just a matter of time.
In addition, I knew i had a height advantage - I was 190cm and he was only 172cm. I feel like my looks are above average as well so I think that helped me in a way. On a normal day, I would ask when she was going to call her boyfriend so I could give her time and space. But in my heart I secretly wanted her all for myself.
I waited patiently, for my time to strike. It had been a few weeks now and I thought about how to disrupt their daily calls as they were still going strong. Thus, I had to purposely ask her to go for random courses and classes in the evening, as that was the only time she could call her boyfriend (due to the time difference between singapore and UK). Slowly but steadily, she started to reschedule or even cancel the calls with her boyfriend - to my pleasure.
She slowly grew attached to me, and told me some heartfelt thoughts like how she felt distant with her boyfriend. She asked me for advice of what to do and obviously I had to sow discord between them and even made her doubt their relationship.
In addition, I used a fake instagram account that I bought online to mask myself as some ex classmate of hers (let's call her Jane) and saying things like how her bf was cheating on her. Finally, the turning point in their relationship came. The LDR, constant fights and distrust became too hard to bear. They broke up and she naturally came falling into my arms.
I feel bad and actually guilty for doing such things thats why I'm writing this confession. My question to you guys is that if you were in my shoes, what would you do for love? what boundaries would you break and what morals would you shatter - to attain this entity we call love?
TLDR: Just because there is a goalkeeper, dosent mean you cannot score a goal. I hope this story inspires people out there whose crushes are attached, where I want you guys to know that nothing is impossible, just follow your dreams.

Eww. So recently, I fell in love with this guy I met online few months ago, we starting meeting up, do some dating & couple things together. He is really smart, good career, well built, and heads to yoga & gym along with me. But the height was an issue to him because he is a 168cm. He also told me that he belong to the smaller side. I told him it is fine, I will still treat him like a king, my own king. I understand from my sisters that girls need to constantly rub guy's ego, so I really tried everything to do that. But, last night on NY was a shocker to me. We did the deed and I am shocked that his thing is the size of my pinky finger!! Literally 3cm full erected & its not even thick at all. Although my pool of sg guys wasn't a lot, but from the data i gathered together with my sisters, sg guys have a max of up to 15cm or footlong. But hell.. why am I seeing this. So I want to ask the ladies here, what will you do if you face this? Should I break up with him given that I know I won't be satisfied with my sex life ever if I marry him one day?

58980,103870,"Some people would hate me for sharing this. I am a slim girl naturally well-endowed with huge boobs. For Chinese girls, those with skinny limbs, small hips and flat stomach usually have flat or small chests. To give you some perspective, it is a 36C. And I am only 162cm and 48kg.
I'll be honest... I do enjoy the attention. Sometimes, I wear push-ups and straighten my back to make my assets more obvious. Other times, I don't even wear a bra, and even though it doesn't look as big, the nips are visible. I am proud of it, and I like to low-key show off, though I never say it out loud. Sometimes, I even unbutton the top 2 buttons of my shirt or angle my posture such that people can get a sneak peek of my bare breasts through an opening in my shirt. I know this sounds really perverted and twisted af, but I think I might be an exhibitionist. I hope you don't judge me.
I know that many girls are jealous and many guys fantasize about me - and I have caught many staring, including teachers and dads of my friends. It gives me a devilish kind of happiness when I hear that my boobs are the talk of the town. I'm sorry if you feel like telling me off at this point. But this is me.
But recently, for the first time in 24 years, I felt sad after wondering if having huge boobs is the only thing that I will ever be known for. And I feel empty.
What happened was this: I just broke up with my ex-bf over text for personal reasons, and he was really upset. I understand why he was angry, but I could not have anticipated the stuffs that happened later. Out of spite, he revealed that the only thing he wanted in the relationship was to get access to my boobs and describe them to his guy friends. Nothing about my ""bitch character"" attracted him, it was only about the sex. He even told me that his guy friends had all seen my nudes that he took, and I was just a conquest for him to show off his exploits. Wtf right. What an asshole. To verify, I asked a mutual friend who was in that gang, and he admitted after me probing for some time that he showed them those private photos on his phone but never sent them electronically. I had never felt more offended and insulted in my life. I remember I was so angry that I was screaming my head off in my room and throwing and breaking things, and my sister almost wanted to tie me up. I let this douchebag take my virginity, use me to fulfil all his deviant fantasies and I had only ever given myself to him and nobody else in my entire freaking life! And he just bloody treated it like it meant nothing to him! I was so furious that I even entertained the idea of hooking up with his brother or his boss, who is a friend of mine, just to get back at him. I actually sent out a video message saying ""Hey, want to hook up I really want this"", but recalled it shortly after thank goodness for Telegram's recall function. Eventually, common sense got the better of me and I didn't end up doing anything rash. Now, I still feel angry enough to feel shortness of breath every time I think about this, but at least I am rational enough not to do something I'll regret.
Now that I am here, I want to ask. How do I filter out the guys who are only after my boobs? How can I give people the impression that I am more than just my body parts? I can't be wearing oversized tees all the time, and I love my girly wardrobe. Also, I am a young woman, and I still want to flaunt it a little and feel sexy.

58885,103691,"I recently dated a Singaporean guy and eventually he become my bf. He did pay for the first date and all. But subsequently in the relationship, he did hint to split 50 50 and want me to take parts of my share. He send me home everytime initially , but after we get together, no more. He say in Singapore, 80% of the relationship goes on dutch and 15% is guys pay all and 5% others. It is true? I wasnt from Singapore and he was the first Singaporean bf I have. From my understanding, guy do pay for dates. But when in relationship, is it normally dutch? One meal alternatively? He wants equal contribution to our relationship. We had a fight over this and he gave in.
When we talk about family, he say he expect his wife to continue work after pregnancy because he think women will become shallow and obsolete if they don't. Is this a common beliefs among the Singaporean? I don't intend to be a housewife but taking out the option is another thing.
I know each relationship is unique and we are all dealing with different things. The objective is this post is just to understand the social norms Singaporean guys have. I am just confused that is my bf the norm or not.
My bf still treated me very well and love me a lot. He did pay for most of the date and I pay for some dates. He pay for the food, I pay for the drinks.

58292,102602,"My husband has a s** addiction issue. What should I do?
When we were dating I know his past gfs were all of a different nationality. I was his first gf of the same race as him. We were together for 6 years before getting married. All along I didn't notice anything amiss about him. We have a typical safe and secure relationship I guess. He makes me feel safe. He respects me. He is filial to his parents as well as mine. He is kind to people around him including the cleaners. He doesn't judge or say anything bad about others. He is smart. He has a good career path planned out and he knows what he wants to achieve in life and he involves me in all his plans. To me, he is perfect.
When I was pregnant with our first child, I discovered that he had been visiting prostitutes throughout my pregnancy. Not just any type of prostitutes. But a particular type. It was such a rude shock to me and I almost delivered my baby early. I cried a lot before and during the initial months after the birth of our child and I fought with him a lot. He confessed to me he has an addiction. He thought he had gotten over it after we are together but the urge came when I was pregnant and he couldn't control himself. We went for therapy and he also attended therapy for his fetish. I chose to forgive him and start over.
More than 5 years later, I thought we have put this behind us. But recently he confessed to me he reoffended again not once but several times recently. He couldn't bear the guilt of hiding it from me so he told me. He beg me to go with him for counselling again. He didn't want to lose me.
I am so heartbroken and I feel so lost right now. I thought of separation because I feel I am going mad just having him in the same house. At the same time I feel and wonder how can I help and support him. I love and hate him so much now. I feel so lost. If you're an addict, will you ever get over it? Is there hope for us? I don't think I can go through this again.
We only have 1 child. I chose to not have more in case he hurt me again and he did. I have my own career so I do not feel stuck in the marriage. What can I do?

For all ladies out there...it's real simple. Don't use a photo to cheat a meal, just tell me and I can paynow you so you can eat the buffet yourself. If you're not genuinely here for a date, also just tell me you want to eat the buffet only... I am okay one. Just don't waste my time.

58970,103850,"Have been with my bf for 2.5 years, met through Tinder. Both of us were in uni when we first met and joined the workforce 1.5 year ago. He got promoted to a senior role and started getting really busy with work over the last 5 months. Our meetups were often shortened to just 2-3 hrs a week for a quick meal and catchup, to give him enough time for rest and to spend with his family over the weekends. We missed out celebrating for valentines day, mother's day and my dad's birthday during that entire period due to his busy schedule. My bf has always said sorry for not spending enough time with me multiple times every week and made promises to meet up with me more often.
His project has just ended and I was looking forward to meeting him more as his workload would hve reduced significantly. However, instead of making time out for me, he went ahead to fill his schedule for this entire week with meeting his friends for dinner and drinks, leaving the same 3 hr timeslot for me on a saturday afternoon.
I asked if he will be free next week but he say he will be starting on another project next week and will be back having overtime and a really busy schedule so he is unable to make time out to meet me. Yesterday, I saw a notification from his female friend saying 17 June would be a better date for dinner and out of curiosity, i opened the message. I realised he asked her for a catchup next week as he is free the entire week and gave all the evenings as available options to cater to her schedule. He also offered to send her home after the meal since it would be late (around 9-10+pm) and he wanted to watch out for her safety.
I confronted him about it but he turned it into an issue of me looking into his messages without his consent, which I then apologised. He mentioned that it is an old friend and he havent met her in 6 months hence he wanted to set aside some time to meet her. Sending her home would be a given as he has a car and he wouldn't have to make much of a detour to return back home after that. I tried asking why he seemed very available to meet her and his other friends but not me, and all he ever did was to make it as if I am the one demanding too much from him. He said that he had discussed about his hectic work schedule with me early on in our relationship and he expected me to be more understanding and allow him to meet his friends during his free time.
Am I really asking too much from him? I feel very lonely in the relationship and I'm thinking of leaving if this goes on.

58851,103627,"My fiance has lost money on TerraLuna.
We have been saving up since secondary school. We have plans to BTO, raise beautiful kids and go on dream vacations. All these have come to a naught within a span of just a few days.
The idea of investing in cryptocurrency was first introduced to him by his circle of close friends. He was made to believe that he can make a quick buck and retire early. He took his friends words for it and dabbled into crypto trading.
There were occasions where he would boast to me that he had made a killing which would enable us to realize our dream quicker. Given the volatility of such investment, he assured me that he is well aware of the risk and persuaded me to join as well. Considering that his decision meant well for both of us, I decided to follow suit and entrust my life savings to him in hope that he will not disappoint me.
I should have known better not to do it when he began distancing himself from me and stayed silent on Whatsapp over the past few weeks. Being a concerned partner, I reached out to him to find out how he is doing and to check on our investment. When the topic of investment is raised, he would flare up for no reason and would shout at me over the phone.
A few days ago, a crypto-coin known as TerraLuna (or whatever they call it) made headlines for losing all of its value with allegations made against the founder for fraud.
Worried that it would impact our investment, I phoned my fiance but failed to reach him. I tried to dial his friend only to find out that he had put all his money in this so-called coin only to lose everything. Upon hearing the news, my heart sunk knowing that our hard-earned money were gone and our dreams destroyed. The last I heard about him was from his friend who told me that he had to resort to borrowing from loan sharks in hope to recover his losses only to end up losing more.
We have plans to hold our wedding in Dec which was made known to everyone early this year. Now we have to call it off because of his silly mistake. I can no longer see a future with him and I certainly do not see myself helping with his debt. Heck, I am even contemplating doing OnlyFans to re-build my wealth.
I am v lost as to what to do and how to break the news to everyone about our wedding dismissal should they question about it due to this incident.

My mum is helping to take care now, but I always thought it will be best for a parent to stay at home and take care of the house, so that there will be someone to properly supervise the child and ensure proper upbringing, especially if we have another child next time. She argued that I do not respect her goals and social life and said I am going back on my promises. Yes, she previously did say that she intends to continue to work after having kids. I didn’t disagree back then, neither did I agree too, so there wasn’t any promises made? And I didn’t think she will take it seriously cos I thought alot of women will be open to the idea of staying at home to bond with the child after having one. Her portion of income isn’t really essential too as she really isn’t earning much and I am confident that my salary is enough to support all of us decently. Plus, who will prefer to go out and work and face stresses from bosses, deadlines, office politics etc, over staying at home?? All she needs to do is take care of our son and do a bit of chores during the day and I’ll help her after work. She also complains that I am already not helping out a lot now. I am already trying my best but she doesn’t understand that I have a hectic work schedule that there is just so much time and energy I have to help.
Now she is threatening not to have another child, but prior to marriage we already agreed to have 2 kids to complete the family. I don’t know what I can do to appease her.

This actually caught me by surprise because on my case, I would think that the ""milestone"" of getting a house should be paid by Man as it would reflect his sincerity in getting a flat together with a girl. Is this not right? This is actually a sincere question asking for advice, please do not bash me.
My friends told me they expected the wedding to be fully paid by the Man as it is the Man job to give a woman the dream wedding. Is that right ?
Do people split the cost by having a joint account or how do we determine who pay for what ?

58855,103637,"Honestly, I made a pact with myself to no longer date women who don't work out on a regular basis (and a 'regular basis' for me is about 3-4 times a week for at least an hour). It has to be a part of her routine, like she doesn't feel right when she doesn't go to the gym or workout at home; it has to be a part of her lifestyle. Not necessarily 0% body fat as I'm not into super tight muscular women, but she has to look good and shapely, with or without clothing. She also needs to eat at least moderately healthy, and not a heavy drinker/non-smoker . So many women out here refuse to take care of themselves and expect men to just accept and deal with it especially because of this whole body positivity movement, and I'm not with it.

My husband and I are both high level executives at tech companies. We both draw decent six-figure salaries and have a comfortable life. However, the way my husband runs our household makes me worry quite a lot. He runs the house as if it's a company, with goal setting, performance evaluation and what not. Some of the crazy things he has enforced on us:
- Bi-weekly sprint meetings and retros where we meet to discuss how far along we are in achieving in terms of our career growth, personal growth and fitness
- Quarterly OKRs for our son who is in Primary school
- He made our son set goals for his exam grades, e.g. 95 for English, 100 for Math, etc
- He created dashboards to track our combined income and expenditure, goal progress, etc
- Biannual performance review where we give each other feedback and he decides a rating for us. He will also give an overall family rating depending on our overall performance
- Our family holiday locations and the budget are determined by our family rating. The higher the rating, the better the location (ranging from Maldives to Sentosa)
- Every half, we do roadmapping and each of us have to also talk about how we envision ourselves and the family to be in the next few years and propose changes
I'm a bit afraid for my son that he's growing up in such a stressful environment and have an abnormal childhood. Will this be the case or am I worrying over nothing?

58350,102704,"Hi everyone, so currently I'm in a relationship with this girl but she has this so called ""princess syndrome""
She'll always ask me buy stuffs from online shopping, saying she'll paynow me back but she didn't. Is not a one or two times incident. Been like minimum Twenty times.
When we go out for dates, she watch those videos about couple doing things that make them looked cute.She'll ask me to do things that she felt is cute/romantic and asked me to do the same.
For examples, piggyback her in the middle of shopping mall. Give her surprise gifts like I'm some kind of magician.
Worse of all, her temper is really very bad. There was once before the CB period, bbt was not allowed to operate as they're not considered essential.
She messaged me. Asked me to go and buy for her, which I did. As you all know the Queue was extremely long and the drinks availablity probably ran out. I took photo of the crowds and said ""I might not be able to get the drink you want"", she replied "" yeah can, just buy what's available""
During mine turn to order, the drink she always ordered was oolong milk tea with pearl but it ran out. Only left milk tea with grass jelly so I took it. Took quite awhile for the order to be completed n I took transportation to her house.
Probably about 1.5 hrs for buying the bbt and travel to her house.i was excited to show her that I've managed to get bbt for her and thought she'll be happy but her next actions totally stun me.
She looked at the drink n was screaming "" what drink is this? You know I only drink oolong milk tea with pearl"" I explained that I alr told her that I might not be able to get the drink she wanted and she was the one that said she was fine with it. But now she's screaming at me.
She opened the lid and splashed it on me then slammed the door. During the incident, her parents was not in the country so only she was around in the house. I tried to knock on the door for like half an hour but she didn't even opened the door.
I tried to call her but she rejected the calls and processed to block me. I have no choice so I went back home with the splashed bbt shirt.
When I reached home, she texted me. Saying how disappointed that she is for having high expectations that I should've know her by now what's her favourite drink, how I didn't persistent to knock on her door to show mine efforts of trying to explain to her and how I should've reflected on myself for being a disgraceful boyfriend.
During the days where she ignored me. I have this relaxed, calm environment and feelings which I didn't have it for quite awhile since I dating her. I googled and all the search results shown was that it due to being away from a toxic relationship.
I was so disappointed by her actions, no matter how much efforts I've put in. It was never good enough to please her.
After the incident, few days later. Her parents texted me. They apologized for their daughter actions. They said that the neighbors witnessed the incident n told them about it. I said is okay, I'm cool with it and they've gave the parents talk to her.
Following day after her parents texts, she texted me and apologize for her actions in the incident and I accepted it.
But ever since we get back together, it just seem to be back to the days where she'll be screaming at me for not getting what she wants or not her expectations.
I'm feeling exhausted from this relationship and I wanna to talk to her about her behaviour, the status of our relationship. But she just always avoiding it
I need some advices on how do I talks to her in a way that she'll be listening to me and not always screaming at me like it was everything my fault for all that happened in the relationship.

We have been together for 3 years. I got to know her through her brother. She has a minor disability so she cannot do any work that requires her to stress out her body.
All along my family doesn't have a good impression of her due to some issues. My gf is not a very knowledgeable person and can be quite tactless. She has little friends and little knowledge on social skills so she often offended my parents with words. Once she told my mother that her branded bag is a fake when my mother bought the bag at mbs so there is no way it is fake but my gf insisted. That storm took a few months to settle. I have asked my gf to apologize but she refused. She said she saw on a website about counterfeits so she was sure she is right.
My parents have suggested that I can find a better woman and I find it very disheartening to not have their support. My mother also threatened to leave my name out of the will if I marry her because they don't want my gf to get a single cent. I find things are not working out the longer we are together.
I have many problems with my gf. She wants me to promise her many material things as she won't be working. She wants 1 branded bag a year, holiday twice a year, she wants an allowance even before she finish school. She would cry and make things difficult till I give in when she wants something. As she is still a student I have been paying for all our dating expenses. She would bring me along to her shopping trips and have me pay for her purchases too. She will dictate when I can touch her too.
I reached a stage where I don't think I can support her wants anymore. I don't know how to break up with her without her brother coming after me. Sometimes I also think she is using her disability as an excuse to not want to work. It's a sensitive issue for us and she would throw a fit or cry when I want to talk to her about it.

Other times, the scratching results in some dirt that he rubs between his thumb and forefinger into a little grey ball of death, which he EATS. Lastly, sometimes the scratching dislodges a strand of pubic hair, which he examines with keen interest in the same way David Attenborough looks at insects on plants, before sucking on it.
I have gone down on him many times and I can assure yall that it is not Bengawan Solo down there. So why is he smelling, eating and sucking on by-products of his nether region? Do all guys do these?? How do yall cope with this disgusting side of your husbands/bfs???

57709,101440,"Hi I’m 21(M) and I was matched with a 44(F) in the dating app and I was there for fun. So we met up after a few chats. 3 months later I went to her place and I spent a night with her. I’m surprised she is so good in bed.
I thought women at her age passed child bearing, so I dared to do it. Now I regretted because she told me she was pregnant after a month plus later. I suggested her to go for abortion because I am not ready to start a family, and since she is older than me, she should be able to pay for the abortion. She got angry with me and stopped contacting me thereafter.
I got to know a few days ago she didn’t go for abortion, and she is pregnant with my twins.
What shall I do? To get back in touch with her again? I still not ready to start a family, especially with a woman much older than me.

Tl;dr: my gf gave me an ultimatum and I need help!
I need some serious relationship advice here.
I finally got myself a girlfriend. She’s pretty, has a great figure, but the only downside is she hates my hobby with Pokémon cards.
I had emphasized many times to her Pokémon cards are a form of investment just like how people are crazy over NFTs.
She just can’t seem to accept it.
To provide some context, i was previously a loner with no friends. I had only my Pokémon cards to provide me accompany.
She complains that I am always going back to the mall, spending hours at the card shop looking at Pokémon cards and spending excessive amount of time online.
She calls it a fetish.
After 1 month of us being together, she decided to give me the ultimatum. Give up my Pokémon cards or her.
I am in a serious dilemma now.
Should I get the dark charizard next or the dark dragonite next?

57673,101372,"Sorry if this offends anyone, it's not my intention to.
I've always been embarrassed of my Singaporean accent and Singaporean English. Most of us are bilingual thanks to the education system, but it seems like we're not good at either language. Every time I hear the Singaporean accent on videos, podcasts and interviews alongside the standard western English accent or Chinese accent, I can't help but cringe inwardly. Basic words like ""Salmon"" and ""flour"" are often mispronouced and our grammer is atrocious. You just have to look at the Facebook comment section to find words mispelt and used incorrectly. Yet, we seem to have some sort of superiority complex, reading so many comments and posts chiding people of certain nationalities.
Having lived here all my life, I too have the standard Singaporean accent. Every time I go overseas, I'm very Self concious of my accent. When I speak to my foreign friends I'm afraid that they won't understand me or laugh at my accent. In other words, there's a feeling of inferiority.
Does anyone else feel this way? Have we tried too hard? Isn't it better to learn one language and be good at it than to learn two and be terrible at both? I'm curious what foreigners think about our accent and the way we speak English.

Her husband is not well-educated and from what I observe, not rich too. I used to buy her gifts on anniversary and birthday but her husband doesn’t, and she knows I have a lot of savings since we were dating and we both come from uni background, currently we are both currently mid-level executives, but she chose a husband that does not even work in corporate. I don’t understand why she chose him over me when I’m a better option.
Whenever I talked about BTO or having kids with her last time she will always laugh it off and not take it seriously but she settled down with her husband after one year, and we were together for four years. I believe I’m more good looking too, I go to the gym often and used to be in the school sports team, but he doesn’t work out, so I really don’t understand whats better about him.

Every 3-4 months one of his parents' FD accounts matures and they 'give' him the interest. It's over $8k each time, all of their savings.
He works part time, 30 hours a week cos he wants more time for hobbies. He takes home around $2k per month. He doesn't give his parents any money. His almost 70yo mum buys everything for him including vitamins, daily food and snacks, all his meals, soap, shampoo, etc. He doesn't do any chores. His parents even gave him the master bedroom cos he is now 'grown up'.
Parents are middle class, his mum still works but wakes up early every morning to make or heat up a huge breakfast for him and usually buys his dinner. He will skip lunch so he has more disposable income for hobbies. Personality wise he's fun, easy to talk to and we have a similar sense of humour and hobbies. I've felt so comfortable with him compared to any other guys I dated. I enjoy his company alot. But long term?? I don't know.
He is not generous with me. Forgets to pay me back for meals, etc. He doesn't have any plans to move out of his parents flat anytime soon cos he said it's quite comfortable. How can there be a future with this guy?

But yesterday when I was helping him to spring-clean his room for CNY, I stumbled upon this army notebook of his. I recall that he told me as a second-gen PRC he had to serve, and he was a Platoon Sergeant, so I was curious and had a look at what he wrote. Lo and behold, it was full of Chinese transliterations of army commands and on one page, there was a full-blown Tang dynasty-esque poem:

I want to have a future with him. We even applied for BTO already. However he always tells me that I am easily influenced by my friends and social media. I feel guilty going out with my friends, and feel even more guilty when I use social media or play games.
He always calls me toxic. He had hit me before, making me bleed several times by punching me in the lip and the solar plexus.
He calls me manipulative. I always try and go out of my way to communicate to him and meet him even though he blocks me everywhere. But he will act cold to me and pretend like I don't exist.
What should I do? I feel very stressed out but he blocked me and there is no way for me to contact him. I have been very supportive but to him I am just not trustworthy. I feel so tired in the relationship because he likes to play mind games like tell me I am toxic, or say that it is all because of social media and my friends thats why I am behaving the way I am.
I want to break up with him but I am afraid as I still love him and care for him. But it's so tiring to be in a relationship where I dont feel like my actions are being reciprocated. I just want to communicate with him but he always refuses. I am tired.
He always blames me when he gets angry or fails at anything in life. For example he used to be an elite student with very high CAP, but when his grades dipped, he said it was because I was influencing him to become a worse person, but in actuality, I am a first class honours and have always kept improving throughout our 4.5 years. I feel like he doesn't even have his own life together.

I’m a 160cm guy, got rejected by females way too many times and it’s hard for me to even find a girl who likes me back. But well, I somehow managed to find a girl who agreed to date me but she openly uses dating apps in-front of my face and often talks about her chats with the guys on there to me. She would ask me what she should reply to them and even screenshot their chats and laugh about them to me. She would swipe guys inf-ront of me and almost every swipe was a match.
My friends told me to break up with her but how could I, when I really want some affection from a girl and it took me so long to finally get a girl? Breaking up isn’t an option, because as long as she’s willing to stick with me, I’m willing to do anything, even if it means endure seeing her use dating apps and sugar daddy websites. She said it’s because I don’t have money to spend on her, so she has to search for sugar daddies.
I swear this isn’t a troll because I know it sounds ridiculous - but she’s a v**gin and doesn’t want to have s** with me (only give bj hj). She would rather give her virginity to sugar daddies for the money. (she’s not even poor so idk why?) She even told me “you no money what, unless you have money then you don’t come talk to me about it”.
I feel hurt but I can’t tell her off because she told me “It’s my choice if I wanna use dating apps, you can’t control me. If you wanna date me, you have to accept that I’m gonna use tinder and I WILL continue to use tinder just so you know.” She’s obviously threatening to breakup if I try to control her…. and I cant breakup with her because I really like her and its not like I have other options…..

My fiance proposed last month and we talked to both sides' families as well. My parents were overjoyed but i kinda felt offended when his parents brought up the idea of a prenup agreement. My fiance currently earns slightly more than 1.5x of me and his parents will be leaving him $60k for his future once he turns 30. With that said, his net worth will probably be 3-4x of mine. I just finished paying off my study loan whereas my fiance was blessed enough financially. His parents said that in this era both man and woman should contribute equally to the household. Here comes the irony: when i asked whether my fiance should also contribute equally to household chores and raising the kids, they said that it is a woman's job. Tbh shouldn't the party with more money contribute more? Do they expect me to give birth to the children, feed and take care of them and also contribute equally to the household expenses?
I'm really not sure whether they view every woman out there as golddiggers. I'm a pretty frugal person myself and do not splurge on luxury products. The only branded stuff i have is a pair of chanel earrings i got for myself when i graduated from university. Most of my meals are from food courts and i rarely visit high-end restaurants. Throughout the 5 years of dating, my fiance has never gifted me anything that costs more than $300+/- (except for the proposal ring). Because of this he was able to invest more money and he even said that he was thankful for me as his friends often complained about having to buy their girlfriends dior/chanel/iphones and bringing them to expensive restaurants or cafes.

I'm 30+ this year and was a bully back in primary school. No excuses. I was an asshole, idiot, dick... Back then, I made the unlucky mistake of picking on a rich boy, whom we shall refer to as Q. I didnt know Q is rich, which primary school kid knows the concept of rich/poor? Q accidentally fell and broke his arm.
The school called both sides' parents down for counseling. Q's dad is some high flyer in the private sector and did not have any intention of mediation. He came to inform my parents that he intends to file a civil lawsuit, claiming medical expenses and damages to the family, he also showed us copies of medical reports. My parents pleaded on the basis that
1. They were willing to pay for the medical bills (private hospital somemore)
2. If the verdict is in Q dad's favour, my parents wont have money to pay him anyway, they would be bankrupted and Q dad wont get the money either way.
3. My mum was an office admin and my dad was a taxi driver, they don't earn much.
Q's dad looked straight at me and said ""I'm not after the money, I have money. I'm trying to teach you a lesson."" It has been 20 years but I will never forget his look. He was out for my family's blood. My dad caned and screamed at me that night.
The lawsuit ruled in Q dad's favour. We had to pay for our own lawyers fees, his lawyers fees, the medical bills and Q's dads loss of income (he had to take off work few days to counsel Q). Thank god it didnt bankrupt us but it devastated my parents' finances.
They controlled me extremely tightly after in sec school, which contributed to the strained relationship between my parents and me. Their relationship also began to change. My mum began calling my dad ""useless"" or not being able to earn money or ""have connections"" or being ""only a taxi driver"". Parents divorced almost 10 years ago.
This guilt is eating me. Had I not been a dick, maybe money will be ok. Maybe my parents will still have their marriage. I am not the same person I was 20 years ago, but my family is still feeling the effects of that ""punishment"". Isnt the punishment disproportionate? my family is broken up over what some stupid primary school students did? How is this fair? just because the other side has money? Q is prolly over it and leading a good life. I cant help but think the rich really know how to turn every situation into their advantage and bully us normal people.

I’m with this girl for a few months, let’s call her J. I was initially very attracted to J’s good looks and well grooming. I’d say her looks are among the top 10-15% of all the girls I met. Despite being an average guy, I planned and chased her and won her heart after some time. However, as we spent more time and knowing each other better, I realized there is indeed a huge gap in lifestyle and abilities between J and me
- J lives in a big semi d landed house while my family lives in a old 4 room flat. Her dad owns several successful businesses while my parents are average income workers
- Her social skills are top notch and she can talk to ppl and make friends easily across age groups and nationalities. I don’t make friends easily as I don’t reveal myself too much to strangers. I also have problem’s especially dealing with ppl with power and knowledge like bosses or professors.
- she is an active sports person and her body is very fit. I’m slightly chubby, although tall. I don’t have a toned body and often struggle to pass my IPPT.
- she is fluent in English, Chinese and german, almost to the native level. I speak singlish most of the time and can’t even write standard English or Chinese well.
- Her CAP is 4.6x while I am 3.1x.
There are many other things too. I have asked J what attracted her to me and she said it was my integrity, sincerity and kindness. But I know that integrity and kindness alone can’t sustain a relationship. My confidence drops a little every time I went out with J and know more about her. We are still in the honeymoon phase but she may start comparing me with other guys once the honeymoon fades. I have heard many examples that it just won’t work out if the guy and girl are too different. Even if she can accept me, her family would disapprove such a guy due to the big diff in SES. I’m thinking to take some pain now and just break off instead of prolonging smth that prob won’t end well.

She isn’t exactly the “goddess” kind of girl. She is the girl-next-door type that you will easily fall in love with. Good-natured, cheerful and sweet. She smiles a lot. She is tall for a girl, at 174cm (I am only 178cm) and very slim. She is tan as she likes to swim. She wear her hair in a simple bob at chin length (till recently), which she trim once it touches her shoulder. She told me she keep the same hairstyle since primary school. She dress simple, T-shirts and shorts most of the time, or T-shirt and Jeans if attending class. She doesn’t put on makeup.
I like her a lot because she is very understanding and doesn’t have high expectation (of me). Unlike my exs, she does not expects nice and expensive gift from me. Sometimes she cook and pack lunch for me. She really cook well. She never complaint that I play computer game a lot, and she sit quietly at the side when I was having a game of basketball with my friend. She doesn’t go clubbing but she never complain a single time when I went clubbing with my buddy without her. She never flare up and never a harsh word to me. She don’t expect me to do anything for her and will even volunteer to help me run my errand.
At the start of this year, she start visiting me at home during weekends, and she will stay for dinner. My mother likes her because she is very polite, help in the house chores and she help makes dinner whenever she was here. Then one time, it getting quite late and my mother ask her to stay for the night. From then on, she stay over every weekend. We start to have sex. Surprisingly she is very active, unlike the demure self in the day. I can’t help but notice how skinny she is, and wish that she can put on a little more weight.
So every weekend, we live just like any young couple, study, watch Netflix, going to buy groceries, meals, sex etc nothing special. But I felt blissful.
Then something changed a month ago. She always followed me to the malay barbershop downstairs, and wait for me to get my haircut. But this time, she wants to cut her hair too, I was surprise and told her I can bring her to a nice salon. She said its ok as it here cheaper here, and moreover she want a shorter cut which normal salon don’t do good. So I watched helplessly as the barber cut a good 10cm of her hair to a boyish cut that revealed her ears. If it was cut in a salon, it will pass off as a pixie cut, maybe more feminine. I don’t like it and told her to grow her hair long. She just smile. My family members are surprised by her haircut too. But my mother was all praise at how sweet she look even with such short hair. I can’t believe my mother actually encourage her.
Anyway, after this incident, I become conscious of how Tomboy she look and dress. I get annoyed when my female friend teased that she looked great and will fall in love with her.
So the last straw. Last week I went for my monthly haircut, she said she wanted a trim as well. I told her No as she supposed to grow her hair long. She said just a trim as the hair at the ear is sticking out and keep persuading me. Finally I agreed. So after my haircut, she sat down on the same chair. She converse with the Encik in malay for quite a while and the cape was put on. To my horror, the barber start to use a clipper and dig deep onto her nape and high onto the back of her head. I exclaimed that it shouldn’t be this short. My gf however assured the barber it’s ok and urge him to continue. I get really angry with each pass of the clipper. The final cut is a neat man haircut with closely clipper side and back. The top is no more than 5cm and well combed. My gf can easily pass off as an army regular anytime. I was so angry I cursed at her. I keep silence the world day without speaking to her. At night, seeing that I am still angry, she offer to have sex with me. While we are at it, I can’t help but keep seeing the closely clipper part of her head. It feels weird on my hand and I lost interest. I feel like I am having sex with a man.
It’s been a week since I avoid her. I know its only hair and it will grow, I should not be petty as a man. Moreover she is such a wonderful girl. But she lost all her attraction to me and I can’t kick away the feeling that I am dating a man.
I know I am the jerk to be thinking this way. I am blessed with such a wonderful girl as my gf, but at times I really wished that she is more curvy and well-endowed; and doll up a little.
