55603,95616,"I am 20 and my bf is 22 and he is currently in NS which means he earns barely enough to support me.
Whenever I request to eat something that is apparently not very comfortable to his wallet (not sure what that means), he will always insist we eat at a nearby foodcourt or hawker?
Firstly, places like that are usually very dirty and hot like why would I even consider dining there? The food's good but he brought me out for a date so I shouldn't even be expecting him to request us to eat there? Like it's a date and I barely get to see him because he only books out on the weekend.
Secondly, I prefer food that looks pretty so I can take Instagram worthy pictures of it and have my bragging rights?
Lastly, I don't want to be seen dressed up in a very cute dress while at a hawker? That doesn't look pretty to me anymore.
Even when eating out at a mall, I was obviously craving for pasta and of course I wanted Hoshino, but he could only offer to dine in at Saizeriya because it was cheaper for him. Wtf? I will never step foot into that restaurant knowing that is where all the poor people go to when they want to eat pasta and try to pretend they are atas, BECAUSE WESTERN IS EXPENSIVE. Eventually we did ended up in Hoshino, but he didn't order his food because mine was already $13 which is double of what is offered at Saizeriya in terms of price. Whatever, at least I got to eat what I wanted :). He then went home and cook Maggie for himself? How broke can anyone be? Don't get a girlfriend if you can't afford it, especially when you're in NS.
I need some advice and or suggestions to open up my bf's wallet like stop being stingy...

We have nice conversations and sometimes we laugh together. But, I see no future in us. I think I am more into the more muscular type of guys and at least drive. But last week, he did something totally unexpected. omg. You know the durian season is here and the people here are all nuts for this. He suggested we buy some durians and eat at my place. He then chose some durians himself. omg. I never knew he has these skills. He declined the opening of the fruit and insisted to open the fruit at home. woah. once at home, he displayed his opening and cutting skills. You know the part where you needed to bend and push the fruit lips apart to get the seeds? omg, he did with such strength. I admit, I was a bit wet and turned on. omg, such hidden skills. what should I do now?

55182,94643,"Tldr: Just broke up with my fiance whom I share a joint account with. Am I the asshole for asking for 100% of the money in our joint account because I think he should compensate me for my time wasted on him?
I have been dating my fiance for 3 years and we have been working for 2 years since graduating. He proposed to me last december and since then, I have been asking him to plan for our wedding, which I would prefer to be held as soon as possible because I am tired of working and want to be a housewife.
He told me he would prefer to have the wedding next year because he needs some time to plan the wedding but I want it to be held preferably by end of this year. Since he has agreed to stay at my parents’ house after marriage then there shouldn’t be any issues at all.
I just cannot understand why he wants to wait until next year to have the wedding because actually I was asking for a very simple wedding. I only wanted to invite our friends and relatives to a dinner at a mid-tier hotel like Pan Pacific and to get very affordable wedding bands like Cartier. He certainly can afford them because he has $30k in his personal savings account and he earns $5k a month.
I’m not even asking for much because I know there are way more expensive places to hold a banquet and way more high-end jewellery brands to get wedding bands from. But he thinks that the wedding bands and hotels I chose are too extravagant even though I have offered to help him pay 20% of all expenses. Because of all these issues, we quarrelled a lot and eventually I decided to break up with him because I realise he’s a very selfish person who doesn’t even care about what I want at all. Even the engagement ring he got for me was a small 0.9 carat which cost only $9k although I have specifically told him that I wanted a 1.5 carat.
Now that we have broken up, we are in the midst of discussing how to split our joint account money and he said he will give me half of the money inside, which is only $10k. His excuse for giving me only half of the money is that he was the only one contributing to the joint account. He did contributed to 100% of the joint account but I was the one who encouraged him to save up. Whenever he wanted to buy useless things like Nintendo Switch, I stopped him from buying them. Without me, he wouldn’t even have savings at all. Moreover, I wasted 3 years of my life on him so I think I deserve more than $10k. Honestly, even if he gives me all the money, which is merely $20k, I still don’t think it’s enough to compensate for the 3 years. But he seems reluctant to give me 100% of the money and kept giving me all sorts of lame excuses. Should I continue to ask for $20k or should I just settle for $10k? I’m so tired of fighting over this.

Just broke up with my boyfriend (you know who you are) over his obsession with Japanese Cartoons. He was so sweet and nice when we first met as friends but as we got closer and closer he started to reveal his degenerate “Otakooo” side.
At first I was pretty ok with it since I thought it was just a minor side interest (we used to go to bar hoping and partying quite a fair bit), but after we started going out he exposed more of more of his disgusting hobby to me. I decided to put up with it since he was such a nice guy but it eventually got on my nerves and I had no choice but to ghost him.
The final straw that made me write this was browsing thru HWZ (thanks to him, ughhhh) and realising that so many of Singaporean guys are also these disgusting, misogynistic ootakoos. My girlfriends tell me that it’s very normal but I just can’t stand the thought of so many Singaporean guys being interested in such immature and disgusting hobbies.

55205,94699,"Should I marry my boyfriend if I’m not physically attracted to him?
I’m 27 years old and my bf is 35. We have been together for 7 years and have just paid the downpayment for our BTO. Our wedding would be held in June this year.
When I first met my bf, I had just gotten out of a two-year relationship with my ex and I only intended to use my bf as a rebound to get over my ex. Since my bf was just a rebound, I didn’t care that he’s ugly. In terms of appearance, he’s at most 5/10 but I’m 8/10. Sadly, he’s also very short and skinny (170cm,62kg). Worst of all, he earns very little ($5k/month). My ideal guy has always been someone who is at least 180cm and earns at least $10k/month.
My bf looks ugly but character wise, he’s the nicest guy I’ve ever seen. Throughout the past 7 years, I have tried dating other men. But the guys I dated were not as nice. Some of them had severe commitment issues and some were assholes who cheated on me. On the contrary, my bf has always been a very loyal and loving bf for the past 7 years. To me, my bf feels like someone I could always depend on and that is why I love him so much.
The only problem that I’m facing is, I am not physically attracted to my bf and I cannot imagine being physically intimate with him. Because of this, I told him that I want to wait until marriage to have sex when in fact I already had sex with those guys I dated in the past 7 years. Up till today, I still feel very guilty for what I have done and this is also one of my biggest regrets.
I feel very guilty that I enjoy getting intimate with other men but I still refuse to get intimate with my bf. Recently, I’m starting to feel very worried about having to get intimate with him after wedding. After so many years, I still feel uncomfortable kissing him and when I kiss him, I always have to imagine I’m kissing my crush. And sometimes I really regret applying for BTO with him. But honestly, I don’t mind dating him. I just don’t know if I should marry him. Has anyone been in my shoes? Has anyone married someone you’re not physically attracted to? Is it possible to have a marriage without physical attraction?

56906,99385,"#99385: This is a question for Prof Ben and also for everyone else with experience in relationships, especially on the financial side of things. Shoutout to Prof Ben as I believe you once mentioned that you leave all your money for your wife to handle?
To give some context, I have been with my gf for 2 years. She is from a quite well-off family the kind who owns around 10 properties. My family is not well off, likely bottom ten percent of Singapore if you consider net worth. Her salary is about 3k a month and mine is around 15k a month. I am one year older than her.
My gf said some things to me last week which I found quite shocking.
Firstly she said she feels like dating a secondary school kid when she is dating me. She said because I often buy basic jewellery and food for her, or bubble tea which is a childish joke. She mentioned her friends' boyfriends buy expensive watches and bags for them and even her parents buy expensive makeup and perfumes for her, so she expect her boyfriend to at least be able to match what her parents can give her because that is her standard. She said instead of giving her small gifts or writing cards to her, she rather I stop being a kid, so immature, grow up and buy her expensive things. She said this is how adults date. Her friends who chose bfs or eventually husbands based on how much money they can give them, are all now very happy.
Secondly, she said she is upset at me for being so poor and earning so little money. I was very surprised to hear this come out of her mouth given that I make five times her salary. She said she feels sorry for me that I cannot spend more money and feel like paying for me so often. But I know she say say only, our expenditure when dating is almost entirely paid for by me. She swipes parents' credit card even when shopping for herself. She said I am very incapable and I should reflect on why my salary is so low. She said she is unsure if she can continue dating such a low income guy like me.
I countered by saying actually on 3k a month, based on her own earning abilities, her lifestyle should be on the more budget end. By saying all these, it means she wants to use my income to upgrade her own lifestyle. I asked her to clarify if this is fact. She then said that is not true, my lifestyle is too budget for her and I need to up my game to match her standard. I was so confused so I said ok long story short, you just want me to buy you expensive bags and watches is it? She said yes. Then I said did you just contradict yourself then? She said well it is ugly to say it out directly, she is giving me a chance to be a real man and gentleman and take the hint and spend on her without saying it and making everything sound not nice.
She then went on to say she is unhappy that I help out my parents financially etc etc and that I cannot give her a sense of security unlike her friends' boyfriends who spend 100 percent of their salary on their gfs and then borrow or take money from their parents to cover their own living costs. I countered by saying isn't that leeching off the older generation? She scoffed and said that is called the power of a family, the power of a community. I know nothing about all these because I am from humble backgrounds and this is how the real world works.
I must admit I was super shocked to hear all of these. The only hint I ever got before this that she thinks this way was that she is always telling me about her friends' successful golddigging attempts and how happy they are.
Do you people think any of her points are valid?
It sounds so messed up to me but she said everything so convincingly and matter of factly that I am not so sure anymore.",,5906645136072565,119,432,117,2021-08-18 17:27:47+00:00,2022-05-15 10:04:12+00:00

We had dinner at a french restaurant and after desserts I told her I need to use the toilet urgently but actually it was just an excuse to leave the restaurant. After telling her I need to go toilet, I stepped out of the restaurant and immediately went back home.
I know it was not very nice of me to leave but at least when I reach home, I texted her that I won’t be going back to the restaurant due to urgent matters at home and I also thanked her for footing the bill. Fortunately, the restaurant was quite affordable so the meal probably only costed $80+?
Tbh I feel bad that she had to pay for the meal but then again, she catfished me so I am the real victim!! Anyway, I already wasted so much time on going out with her so it would be ridiculous to even pay for the meal. Somemore she was so dishonest so she should pay the price for being so shady? Lol

When I asked for a valentine's date at the USS, he told me to go there some other time because of the crowd. His reason is that Valentine's Day is a ""corporate trick"" to make us spend more on things we don't need and that day doesn't have any significance.
When I asked him what ring he is going to buy for me when we get married, he started talking about how the price of diamonds is artificially inflated through a monopoly and started talking about the history of marketing of diamonds.

56945,99272,"Seeking advise to help for my husband
I am a 33 years old working mum of 2 son, 4 and 2 years old. My husband is 30 this year but he is very lazy.
I met my husband through a common friend 5 years back when he just returned from studies in the UK. We hit off pretty well as he's witty and humorous plus he secured a very good career in an MNC company and decent family. I'm comfortable with him taking the lead and planning for everything so I usually don't have any inputs for his decision despite him always asking me for it.
I got my legs swept off by him and agreed to marry him after 1.5 years of relationship. But things start to change much after marriage. He became very lazy whenever I asked him to do stuffs. Like when I asked him many times to get a driving license, he said that he never actually needed one as he has someone to chauffeur him around and taking PHV or cab is cheaper than owning a car in Singapore unlike UK. I was pretty upset when he said that as a car would be convenient for checkups for my gynae visits and meeting up with my friends.
He does not help out much in housework except for washing of clothes, windows cleaning and fans as there are much more things to do apart from these. He will usually lounge around or sneak off to go for exercise once he is completed with those chores while I need to look after the kids. I told him there are many other chores to do but he always said that he will do later but never did.
His working hours are pretty hectic as he will usually reached office by 8.30am and will only reached home by 8pm. As I finished work earlier, I will usually picked up my kids from childcare and buy dinner, which is quite tiring when my cab doesn't arrived on time or when the food delivery doesn't come early and need to tend to hungry kids. Travelling can be pretty tiring even via taxis. I always tell him to cab home but he likes to travel by MRT as it helps to save cost. Cabbing home can reduce an hr of travelling time which he can help me to tend to kids when i'm tired and he's earning a high 6 digit figure per annual, I can't figure out why he is so petty on money when I'm only earning 1/3 of his salary. Although he pays for all the cab rides and food but I just want him to share the load of actual parenting. I felt so overwhelm by the fatigue that I actually quit my job to take care of the kids when my 2nd kid was born. I told my husband that he should spent more time to take care of the household but he often use work or a need to exercise as an excuse. I don't understand why he needs to choose timing to go for exercise. For weekdays, he has free time from 11pm onwards, but he can choose to go straight after work. For weekends, it's even worse, he can opt for timing like 1 to 3pm where the kids are usually sleeping or 10pm onwards but he choose timing like 6am in the morning or 5pm in the evening when the kids are awake or going to be awake.
Things start to have a strange turn of events when he mentioned that he wants to quit his job and spend time. I felt very happy and relieve when he said that. But the downside is that, he told me that I may have to look for a job as he could have difficulty finding a job that has work life balance and decent salary. I was happy and disappointed at the same time, but I guess that's life. So I agreed and he quit his job and he's taking care of the kids at home while I went back to the workforce after 2 years of being a housewife. Things are doing great for me as the workplace is good and the pay is much higher than my previous job, but not for my husband. He has difficulty finding a manager entry level job as he is over qualified, having armed with an Imperial College degree and INSEAD MBA, he has difficulty finding a job that support work life balance and decent salary when he is willing to take up to a 75% pay cut. Despite being at home, I find that the status of the house cleanlines is not up to my standard when I can find small peck of dust on the window grill when I do my spot check and he still has the tired feel when he doesn't even need to work. I don't understand why can't he take care of the house when I'm earning the dough. When confronted, he said that he is making pretty good money while being a day trader and suggested that we should get a maid to do the menial work while both of us earn the money but I don't like strangers to stay with us. I also urged him to be more active on job hunting as we have expenses to pay for. I need his contributions for my parent housing loan and our utility and my cab expenses. Luckily our 5 room is fully paid thanks to his investment. He's pretty lazy as his day trading can fetch about 5k for good months and 3k for bad month and has a emergency savings for 10 years without working, but it can be embarrasing for a guy to be unemployed for long time.
I asked my friends for advise but their responds are pretty mixed and I'm also dried up for solutions, which is why I would like to sought for more options to get my husband to help out more.

56752,98792,"For those who are considering joining the real estate industry as a real estate agent; PLEASE I urge u to think twice. Especially if you’re leaving a stable salaried job to do this.
Don’t be fooled by the posts of your friend posting their awards & fancy cars and shit on social media and think it’s so easy. It’s not.
Don’t get brainwashed by the managers who are trying to recruit you that it’s such good money and that you can also do it. They earn an overriding commission from their team members so of course the more the merrier. My team manager makes $30-60k a month alone on his team overriding commission; and that’s on top of his own sales. Don’t forget that these people are highly skilled salesmen who can sell ice to eskimos.
The reality is that only the TOP 1-5% of ALL agents make good money & the rest are barely making it. I am not exaggerating. The people in the Top 5% are making all the money.
If you’re not in the Top 5%, u can totally forget about it. There’s over 30,000 agents in Singapore- u do the Maths.
In my first 2-3years, I burned through all my hard earned savings on PropertyGuru credits (I think burned about 5k), various training courses (3k here and 6k there), various apps & misc expenses.
Besides PropertyGuru, there’s also EdgeProp & 99.co- also need to buy credits.
Another 20-30k burned on Facebook & Google Ads.
In this industry you will burn a lot of money first (easily 20k or more in your first year) before u even make your first cent.
If you do not have at least 12 months of expenses saved PLUS min $20k for all these necessary expenses, don’t even consider it.
That’s not the worst part. Just because u burn money on PropertyGuru, Facebook & Google Ads doesn’t mean u will get genuine leads.
95% of all your leads are time wasters. They don’t respond when u contact them. Msg never reply. Or they will make appointment with you & then never show up. A lot of people who fill up your lead form on Facebook are just bored and have no genuine intention to sell or buy property. Cold leads from online marketing are almost impossible to close. Most of them are just “look see only”. I spent over $20k to learn this the hard way. Don’t be like me.
I cannot tell u how many times people have flown my plane. I travel down to the location and waited for an hour & the person never show up.
If you’re a woman, you’ll constantly get harassed by nuisance calls and texts by random male strangers. Because our contact number is readily available online, many men will think it’s okay to take your number and abuse it freely. Pretend to be a buyer interested to buy property, and then after wasting your time for hours, ask if you’re single.
Everyday I will get at least one dodgy text or DM from some creepy anonymous male stranger on various platforms. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
This year after deducting expenses, not only did I not make any $$, I lost around $15-20k.
It’s depressing to think that the people working in McD & cleaners actually earn more than me.
The truth is- You’ll HATE the job UNLESS you’re a natural salesman who genuinely loves interacting with people. The key words being “GENUINELY LOVES”.
I am an introvert, I hate going out, I hate interacting with people in general and I suffer everyday in this job.
So please take my advice. Don’t do it. It’s very painful & not as lucrative as many people think.
Most agents make around $50-100k a year? Might as well stick to a regular day job with CPF and benefits.
The real perk is the security of knowing u have a fixed paycheck coming in every month.
The dumbest thing one can do is leave a stable salaried job for this fucking “job” where U actually have to pay money to do shit U hate & talk to people u can’t stand, everyday going around for viewing after viewing after viewing like a free fucking tour guide.
People don’t care about wasting your time, cos you’re just an agent.
Nobody will tell u this shit because frankly those who are struggling won’t admit to anyone they’re struggling, and the few who are doing very well won’t understand why you’re struggling.
I just wish somebody had told me this shit years ago.

55296,94924,"TL;DR: Rude and arrogant blind date left after I politely gave her advice.
Went on a blind date at the request of my mom and the lady I met up with was arrogant beyond belief. She immediately went from a 9/10 to a 2/10 when I heard her replies.
1. I politely asked her if she's a poly student as she looks quite young. Most women would take that as a compliment seeing how I complimented her on her youthful and young looks. But I was immediately given a hard stare. She told me that she's actually a university student. Fine. Rude but still tolerable.
2. Told me that she is studying events and hope to work in the events industry once she graduates. Hence I told her that it's an industry for men. Which is true as all of my mates in the events industry are all men. But she got very offended by it. And again, rudely stared at me. Nevermind, I close one eye.
3. Asked her why she's taking a double degree when most women end up being a housewife anyways. General question which is also true. She got very offended and rudely insinuated that she won't be one. Again, I paid no mind to her rude stares and arrogance.
4. Gave her a polite advice that men don't like women who are over achievers. Which is true as I believe a lot of women choose to waste time getting a degree to avoid being a housewife. She immediately got up and left in anger which made me angry and embarrassed.
5. Went to pay for the meal but she apparently has paid for the entire bill, which again, made me very feel embarrassed even up till now thinking about it.
Worst date I've been on and hope to never cross paths with her ever again. Are there no women out there who truly want to be housewives? From the way she insinuated that she doesn't want to be one, it's clear that she can't cook, clean or look after her future spouse. Like any other girls with a 9/10 for appearance, she seems to be spoiled, arrogant and ignorant. Would honestly be a 10/10 if she looses a bit of weight. Looks could only get you so far if your attitude is terrible. Therefore she's a 2/10 after embarrassing me.
Hopefully she feels like an asshole for leaving me and making me look like I'm incompetent. Good luck to whoever she dates or marries in the future.

55272,94862,"TL;DR - My girlfriend found out that I have been purposely hiding her from my family. Now she’s upset and wants to break up with me. What should I do?
I have been with my girlfriend for 7 years since uni year 1. I’m 28, she’s 32. Things have been going smoothly until she found out that I have been purposely hiding her from my family and relatives.
When we first started dating, she would post photos of us on Facebook and even tag me in those photos. Back then, I had no intention to commit to her and thus, I didn’t want my family and relatives to see those photos. When she was asleep, I secretly took her phone and logged into her Facebook account and blocked my family and relatives from her account, so that my family and relatives won’t be able to see her profile and thus won’t know that she exists.
When she asked me if my family have FB accounts, I lied to her that they don’t have FB account. When she wanted to come over my house, I lied to her that my family are staying overseas, I’m renting a room in a small flat, my landlords don’t allow visitors. When she asked me why I never go find my family, I lied that I cut them out of my life as they are very toxic.
Two months ago, she suddenly asked me if I would like to buy a resale flat with her and settle down. I told her I’m busy with work and would prefer to discuss this another day. She also started asking me if I would like to meet her family but I always come up with excuses like I’m too busy with work.
She’s been saying how she would like to get married soon but tbh I have no intention to settle down because of various reasons. Firstly, we don’t earn much. She earns 3k and I earn 6k. I don’t think we can afford mortgage, car and kids comfortably. Secondly, she’s not wife-material. She likes to cook but her cooking skills is quite average and she rarely does household chores, usually only once a week.
Since I don’t have the intention to settle down, I don’t see the need to introduce her to my family. Moreover, I think my parents won’t even like her because she’s poorly educated as she’s just a diploma holder and she doesn’t look very presentable as she doesn’t wear makeup and has poor fashion sense.
After she accidentally found out about the list of blocked people on her FB account, she unblocked all of them and found out that my family and relatives are all staying in SG and not overseas. She accused me of betraying her trust in me. She also accused me of looking down on her because she thinks I’m ashamed of her and thus want to hide her from my family. But I’ve never felt ashamed of her. I truly love her as she’s my biggest supporter.
After she found out the truth, she got really upset and now she even wants to break up with me. I feel so disappointed that she is willing to throw away our relationship just because of such trivial matter. Seriously I don’t even know why she need to overreact. What I can do to win her back? I really need her in my life.

56173,97047,"I live 30 km away from my workplace and my job requires that I show up at 8.30 am or 9 am punctually. This requirement could be once or twice a week, or even three times, for about six months in a year. I am not an early riser and typically I get up at sunrise, and not earlier. I'm single and live with my mum, and my aunt lives nearby and comes over for meals. Mum is still ok but now is starting to depend on me for more things. My aunt deliberately moved near us for a convenient arrangement. Taking the MRT is not an option as I can't wake up early enough. Changing jobs is not an option. My options are:
1) Taxi or PHV - the journey is 30 mins but sometimes I get stressed out when the vehicle takes too long to arrive, typically causing me to arrive minutes to spare before the starting time. PHV drivers have ever cancelled on me.
2) Buy a car and drive in the morning - the driving is 30 mins but even entry-level models are expensive
3) Show up the night before and sleep in office - I have a safari bed and sleeping bag at my workstation and access is via access card. Company has not said that I can't stay overnight. There are shower facilities as well. The disadvantage is that I need to have my access card with me if I go to the toilet or shower, i.e. consequences of forgetting that access card when going to pee is quite disastrous.
4) Rent a room 2-3 MRT stops away - this reduces my commute but the problem is getting my family to come to terms with this decision, due to the situation at home. Also, it is not everyday that I have to show up early to work.
5) Buy a flat 2-3 MRT stops away - this also reduces my commute, but gives me extra headache for renovation and similar problem with family accepting this decision.
6) Book a hotel room nearby whenever I need to - this is at least $100 per night for a room ...
I have done option 1 and 3. What would you choose? Are there any other options?

56278,97257,"I am a 35/M and I went to a top secondary school and JC in Bishan.
I grew up around teenagers who prided themselves on their academic performance, on their CCA performance, and believed strongly that they will become highly successful people in the future. I had 2 classmates in JC, now best friends, who told me that they will hit a million dollars in annual salary by the time they reach 35, both of whom went to Oxbridge. Every single straight-A type that I knew had this air of arrogance around them, because I truly believe that they believed that they were better than the rest of us, that they will unerringly turn out to be more successful than any of us.
There was this girl I met in J1. She was a quiet girl who was from a neighborhood secondary school who happened to be in the same OG and class as I was. She was really timorous, really shy. She didn't have the best grades, and was notorious for skipping CCA. I was always confused by how nonchalant she was about schoolwork, how she always copies my homework, and how I have never once seen her studying. She eventually retained, and I lost contact with her.
I was recently having coffee alone at a cafe. She was fiddling around with the POS system. I recognized her immediately because she looked exactly the same as she did in JC. She did her hair up the same way. I approached her to say hello, and she told a younger girl to make her a flat white, and she came to sit with me at my table.
We started chatting about the old days, and I found out she got BCCC/B at A-levels, and did business at SMU. It also turns out that she owns the cafe, along with 13 other F&B establishments in Singapore and JB. Her share of the profits in 2018? 2.7 million. I was speechless for a while. Meanwhile my friends who went to Oxbridge, one of whom on a PSC scholarship, are now civil servants, both earning just a little between 10-15K a month. That's a good salary, but I was mediocre in JC (ABBC/A) and even I am earning more than 15K as a management consultant.
We have created a system of flawed meritocracy where children are brought up believing that just because you are the best in school, you're always going to be best in life. The logic is flawed because being the best in school just means you're going to be ""good"" in life. In most cases, you're just as likely as anyone to become ""great.""
If we think about it, kids become great in school because they understand the system well, and because there is generally a very clear methodology to become great. As long as you don't challenge the system, as long as you work within the ""rules,"" you'll come out on top. In the real world, there are several lines of work in which it is valuable to be able to work well within a system. The SAF for example. Probably explains why the word ""scholar"" always gets paired up with ""general"" in Singapore.
I think we, as a nation, need more humility when we think that the best people in school deserve more praise than any other student. People are good at different things, and school, being able to follow instructions to the hilt, is just one thing.

56799,98938,"Dear Prof. Ben,
Since you went to RI, I’m sure you would have gotten to know some classmates/schoolmates who have now become wildly successful in their careers. And by wildly successful, I do mean very wealthy. I also don’t mean the punch-cards who are working upper-middle class jobs, being paid upper-middle class wages. I mean those who are being paid millions a year, or entrepreneurs whose businesses are making millions a year in profit.
Since you were probably at the top of your cohort, do you secretly wish that you “deserve” more success than you have now? Or that they don’t deserve the wealth they’ve accumulated for not being as smart (or as hardworking) as you were in high school or in college?
I ask this question because I went to Hwa Chong and I was among the top of my cohort. I pursued academia at first, because it was what I was really good at (just generally learning stuff deeply). I dragged my ass through grad school and ended up doing dead-end research for 5 years before I started a job in the industry (CS) where I was paid the same as people 10 years my junior, doing work that to me, is in all sense of the word—stupid.
I have some ex-classmates who are now living in detached houses around Bukit Timah, driving luxury cars, one of whom was a middling student who used to copy my homework (he was smart just lazy). Almost every one of my crazy-rich ex-classmates are business owners, none of whom were particularly talented back in Hwa Chong.
Maybe wealth doesn’t mean much to you, but I was hoping you could help me reconcile being one of the smartest person in school and now having to capitulate to the reality there’s little profit in being so academically-inclined.

56704,98661,"The tech industry in Singapore and Computer Science is now at the top of the food chain and the forefront of development. It can be said that CS and Tech are the king of all jobs right now. Computing students have both the money and the power, they earn a lot and are generally respected by our society. This is just a small but true story to demonstrate why the tech industry is blooming:
My younger brother (born 1995) have just graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering at NUS. However, instead of going for the traditional ME role, he self-taught everything about programming and software engineering, signed up for CS modules as his UEs, and worked remotely for a mid-tier American company for 2 years. He went to class in the morning and went online for only 3 - 4 hours every night to have his works done, earning an official net monthly salary of 3600 USD - or about 4800 SGD. But the main income actually comes from the freelance and commissioned outside projects - completing 1 to 2 of these every week and he could easily earn 9k - 10k SGD in total without paying any additional dollar of tax. After working for nearly 3 years, he now owns a car and a large condominium in Orchard.
Almost every girl are infatuated whenever they hear about IT guys and software engineers. There is this girl studying oversea in Australia, coming back here in Singapore to work and was referred by her older sister to work at the same bank. For some unknown reasons, when my younger brother goes to that bank and doing some transactions, he got both the girl and her elder sister at the same time, and all three started to live with each other in my younger brother's condominium. The two sisters are hailed from a relatively wealthy and prestigious family, with the father being a university professor and the mother working as a civil servant for the government.
When the parents first heard about the news of all three of them living together, they are quite angry and threaten to disown the two sisters. However, after hearing that my younger brother works in the tech industry, they completely changed their attitude towards him. They called and inquired him almost every week, giving him gifts and doing everything to push him to marry their precious daughters as quickly as possible, so as not to miss on the opportunity. My younger brother should have married the elder sister this month, but due to Covid-19 restrictions and some other issues, they have been delaying their wedding ceremony.

55976,96663,"Am I an asshole for scolding my bf for selling investment plans to my parents?
So my bf has been an insurance agent/financial planner before we even got together, and I'm supportive of his career choice. We've been together for slightly over a year and we've met each other's parents a couple of times already. Still, he has only met my parents about 5 times since we only meet up as a family for gatherings like someone's birthday or CNY.
My bf had told me that he wanted to sell insurance/investment plans to my parents and I said no, because I didn't want my parents to think badly of him. You know, the stigma around insurance agents/financial planners.
Then, I just found out that he sold an investment plan to my parents. He waited for me to leave the house to settle some errands and then talked my parents into buying the plan.
Thing is, the plan looks absolutely horrible. My parents have to pay 50k a year for 5 years. They will then get a lump sump back at the end of the 5 years with interest. My parents are retired, and they have about 300k in cash savings. This means they have to set aside 250k in their bank to pay for these 5 years, which means this plan is locking their retirement money which could be put in some other investment plans/stocks. This also means that they only have 50k to spend for the next 5 years which I think is definitely not enough. I feel like this plan is more suited for people who are still drawing an income and can set aside 50k a year to save, and not for people with the actual cash in hand now in retirement. If anything, they should be buying a plan that dumps 250k in now, then withdrawing X amount a year instead.
Now my parents are quite happy with the plan, saying that it has a good interest and all, and my bf is happy that he earned the commission and has somewhat gained respect from my parents as a financial planner. My parents are really not financially literate and the money they have now is from their lifetime of saving. They do not have much cpf because they were self employed (small provision shop). I have not told my parents how stupid this plan is because I'm afraid they'd start to hate my bf or they'd just not trust me, but I feel like it is my duty to protect my parents' interest. Also, they are very stubborn and I feel like I will not be able to convince them to cancel the plan.There's still time to cancel the plan without any fees but I'm in a real dillema now...
My bf is disagreeing that this plan is stupid, and he said my parents have the right to invest in whatever they want without my approval, and he emphasized that they are happy with it. What should I do? I've told him to bring up cancelling the plan instead else I'd do it instead and he said I'm putting him in a spot.

56789,98889,"I am a 27 (F) working in the town area. I would rate myself decent-looking and have had several ex-es who looks pretty good. A month back my company hired a new colleague who is 28 (M). My first impression towards him based on his appearances weren’t very good to be honest. He is not very tall (16-ish), nerdy-looking with an outdated hairstyle. He always goes out to lunch alone, probably because he’s shy and have not blended in yet. I tried my best to avoid him around work (I felt so guilty right now about that) but because of work-related issues, I can’t avoid him completely. There were times he consulted me and I had to teach him.
Only just very recently, out of total coincidence, I found out his daily routine during our lunch break and after work. There will always be an old aunty selling tissues in a corner during lunch break and she always almost get ignored by the passer-bys, but this colleague of mine, he always gets her a cup of coffee/hot milo and buys her tissue packs at an overpaid price. I saw this while I was behind him heading to the same place for lunch. He would even tell the aunty he will be back later after work to see her. I was astonished. I later found out he literally does that everyday he is in the office. The packs of tissues purchased are now all stacked up neatly in his drawer.
There was also another incident at work whereby he got reprimanded for doing the wrong things. I soon realised what he did were actually all instructed and taught by me. I thought he would tell on me but he just kept quiet throughout the entire lecture. When he came out, I hurriedly went over to apologise and all he said was, ‘it’s okay’ and gave me a wide smile. That was one of the brightest and genuine smile I have seen in my entire life. I feel that I have developed feelings for him although his appearances is entirely not my type. I feel that I can actually bypass all these judgemental impressions of mine of a person because of his character for the first time in my life.
Please tell me how do I make my feelings known for him in a subtle way? I don’t think he has much confidence in himself and would definitely not be the one to initiate or confess. For the rest of the ladies out there, please take my heed. Looks are only temporal. What stays is the heart and mind. His heart is greater than everyone’s else.

His mother died when he was even younger due to breast cancer. He is now 25 (just graduated from NUS) and he has decided to grow his portfolio full-time. I just did a simple calculation: if he averages a modest 10% annualized return, he will be worth $270,000,000 by the time he reaches 50; and by the time he reaches 60, he will be $700 million.
Here I am, at my $3800/mo first job, wondering how long I would take to earn enough to afford my first HDB apartment, which I will spend the next 30 years paying.

He then explained how his father is so and so and has a PhD and how he lives in one of those huge ass bungolws I think he used the term GBB or GCB
So then I asked him oh what's that ,he then replied its just a big bungolw ,you don't know ah? Its quite a high ses thing, not many know
He even treated the waiter badly asking him to 'come here' ,no pls no tq or anything.
He then asked what my parents do ,I said oh they are hawkers...
His face changed he asked so you are doing this degree(medicine) to get out of poverty huh .?
I said no I am not i genuinely want to help people out ,why do you think that? I said softy holding in my disgust
He said well you're from poly and your family probably doesn't earn much...and must be not so educated so thats why you want to become a doctor?
Softy again I said ,no I don't think you can stereotype that way
You must be a minority of med students who want to help..thats good he said .
Yeah,I said
Halfway he asked if he can send me home ,I told him no need (I wanted the date to end asap)
He said well I have a lamborghini you know
No thanks ,I'll take train can liao
But I bet you haven't been in one cause your poor he said loudly.
This pissed me off,
I told him ,why you no money buy your own car is it its clearly your dad's car!
Do you think a small ass car will impress me?
Why must I go with you ?
Why did you assume i am poor? You think so so big ah?

You think you are my standard?
I then replied
Stalls !! my family owns a few hakwer stalls
Don't ever judge again you disgusting son of a boofon, idk how that slipped out but I was indeed pissed.
I slaped him and walked off ,leaving $30 to the cahsier for my order
Can't believe that there are guys like this...
Seriously wtf sia ,why do some guys drive daddys car and say its theirs and think that their parents wealth is their's???
Ps. My mom graduated from a top culinary school, my dad is also a uni gardaute
And please don't look down at hawkers, having worked at my parents stall ,I've seen uncles who are primary 3 dropouts who earn millions and yet they are humble and give out food to needy on weekends, and they take in like $5000 a day ,selling drinks only....
So damm pissed, I don't think I will be dating for a while .

56679,98591,"So tldr I am pregnant
Just found out recently, I am quite scared of the procedure and finance wise but honestly I believe abortion is the way to go
Especially since my adult life just started, I don't think I will be able to support the child if I ever give birth to it
So just to ask (becos I'm genuinely curious), is abortion a definite no-go for you or do you think it's acceptable to some extent?
AITA if I want abortion becos I would not be able to support it when it comes out to Earth?
I personally think that if I am financially/physically/mentally stable to have a child, I wouldn't abort it but in these circumstances I honestly don't have a choice becos the child will be a liability when it comes out and I don't want my child to suffer a terrible life so yeah I have made this decision
Thanks for reading I guess I just wanted to get this out of my chest anonymously lmao

56786,98865,"Hi.. I'm a lady and I'm dating a guy, we are both in our mid 30s.
So we started dating for a few mths and it has been great until my parents found out the following:
1) he is from a single parent family
2) he is not as academically qualified (I'm a uni grad while he is several qualifications below, though now he is intending to pursue a ptime diploma)
3) he earns much lesser than me (I earn more than double)
Tbh, he is probably the sweetest guy and most sincere person I have met. And he makes me feel really happy and secure (emotionally)! He took my words seriously, and made changes to his lifestyle like taking up the diploma and changing a job. Even though its early in the relationship, we wish to work towards marraige. My parents who have not met him even, totally objects and disapproves of this relationship. They said, they will disown me if I choose to pursue this without their support.
I want this relationship to work, of course there are challenges ahead. But I feel with finances this is something that can be worked through with effort and time. My parents however, are not giving this a chance and would like to shut this down ASAP. I am v confused because I love him alot and I'm willing to give it a shot. But the parental pressure is also amounting and causing a lot of distractions. He knows what is happening, and he is working on everything he can to solve them. But it will take time, effort and patience. But 1 thing he can't solve is his family background. This is a big concern to my family. Because they feel families should be compatible. This gap is too wide, and have 'downgraded' myself to be with him.
I am so confused, I love him and want to give this a shot. But my family acceptance may never come because they don't want to even meet him and will never accept his background. Also, I am clear that we are running on a tight timeline, and there are things we need to achieve financially in the next 1-2y in order for us to progress forward. This is also communicated to him , but what if we achieved most of it and I wish to progress to marriage, and yet I still can't get my parental approval? Please advise.

55824,96250,"Am I the ass for being upset at the way my girlfriend handled my birthday?
One month before my birthday, I told her it was a big year for me and I am very excited about it. I asked if she is willing to take leave on that day to spend it with me and it will mean a lot to me. She suddenly snapped at me and said I have no right to ask her to do that and got so unproprotionaly angry that I was hurt and confused. Including rollover she has 30 unused leave days this year and has no upcoming travel plans. I got an entire lecture from her on how it is her right on how to use her leave days. I found this whole talk on ""rights"" super turn-off.
Two weeks before my birthday she told me she will bake a cake for my birthday. Then three days before my birthday she said she forgot to get the ingredients, can I keep the whole day empty and she tell me on the day itself if she can bake a cake for me? I thought this was somewhat quite selfish of her to expect this because if she cannot then it is too late for me to make alternative plans but I said okay. One day before my birthday she told me she won't be able to bake a cake for my birthday but will make it up to me and bake the cake a week later, instead on my birthday she will come after work and have dinner with me at my place ordering takeaway food. I said okay.
She surprised me by coming a few hours later at 11.30pm just before my birthday after I had already gone to bed to surprise me with a slice of cake she dabao earlier in the day, and left an hour later, telling me she will come back to my place for dinner. While it was a nice surprise, it did mess up my sleep cycle as I usually sleep and wake up early. When I woke up though on my birthday, I got a message from her, saying I am free anyway since I took leave on my birthday so I should be the one traveling to her place to celebrate my birthday and not the other way round. She said this despite one month ago I already told her I wish to just stay home on my birthday this year. I told her I wished she could be more reliable especially given the context and she proceeded to spend the next 3 hours on a work day for her, screaming at me, and tearing me to shreds, on my birthday itself. She told me not only is she definitely not coming, she will not be baking a birthday cake for me a week later as ""it does not spark joy for her"".
I said you left me hanging, and systematically ruined a super important birthday for me step by step, until the day itself, when it was too late for me to make any alternative plans. She denies all responsibilty and proceeds to gaslight me. Even a week later, she still says it is completely my fault. Her logic and defense now is that she gave me the option to travel to her place at a time of her choosing (she will tell me 30 minutes before she is free so could be anytime between 5pm and 11pm) on my birthday and because I chose not to take this option, it is completely my fault for ruining my own birthday. She said she did her best and hence she is not sorry at all and I have no right to expect her to be sorry. Gosh, another ""rights"" thing going on.
To add some detail, she also neither got me a card nor a gift on my birthday. I asked this in passing (it is not the most important thing to me but it would have been nice) and she said what for, not like I got her anything for hers, which is not true at all. I forwarded her back her old message thanking me for the gift and card I got her for her birthday, saying how touched she is. She defended herself by saying oh of course she remembers those things are from me, just that she forgot it is a birthday gift, as she uses them every week.
She is so sure that I am in the wrong and not her, that I am left feeling confused, hence I am hoping others here can share their thoughts from an outsider's perspective. For me I am very hurt and upset. Should I be? Or am I over thinking and over sensitive?
Can you share how you will feel and how you will handle the situation during and after, if your bf or gf had done the above to you with regards to an important year birthday for you?

57204,100067,"My boyfriend is older than me. He is working full time while I am doing my own business. However, my income is about 3-4 times more than his. I didn’t think this would matter at first because he is a very nice man in general… He speaks politely to the elders, he is a responsible and loyal man and he is also very good with house chores (even better than I am).
But as time goes by, our arguments started revolving around money. When we go for meals together, he will always tell me restaurants are overpriced, we should stick to hawker centre food. I am okay and happy with it. But.. it was so rare for us to eat in restaurants. Sometimes, when business is good and I want to reward myself, I would suggest eating out at a fairly expensive restaurant (bill maybe adds up to about $60-$80). And it hurts me when I see him looking through the menu & not really happy to eat there because it is expensive. But once I offer to pay, he will order more than usual and even start complaining about the food while we are eating.. Like how it tastes just like hawker food so not worth it to pay more blabla…
Since the start of our relationship, he has been a very frugal person, while I usually don’t really look into the dollars and cents when I buy something (I do have an ok amount of savings for my age and I don’t live from paycheck to paycheck). But I was also surprised when he started documenting down all our expenses in a table form and he will even record down to the cents for all of our expenses.. Our typical practice is he pays for everything first then end of the month we split them down to 50-50.
I was also initially okay with this arrangement. And also thought that he is very nice to offer to pay 50% even though he earns significantly lesser. But what I couldn’t accept was that every single expense was 50-50. Sometimes when I look at something that I really wanted to buy (e.g. A piece of cake/ A cup of coffee), he will rarely offer to buy it for me as a treat and he will just stand there and watch me take out my wallet to pay.. Or when he does, he will start to pull that out during our quarrels to prove that he is generous.
I also will buy things for his parents during occasions like their birthdays, father’s/mother’s day, cny, etc. But he has never bought my parents any gifts besides some food he brings over sometimes when he visits.
Sometimes, when I am bothered by it, I do sit him down and speak to him about it. I also asked if it’s okay to not count everything down to dollars and cents e.g. he could try paying for one meal while i pay for the next. doesn’t matter who pays more, let’s not be so calculative to each other about it since we are a couple. but he hasn’t been receptive towards it and he thinks his way of doing things is fair. he will then start talking about how he has certain limitations like his job doesn’t pay him that much what can he do, i earn more so i should be able to pay for my own things. He also doesn’t dream of earning big. He is a very contented person and he is happy with his current income, he doesn’t see a need to earn more.
Just last week, he popped the question.. I do love him a lot but these thoughts will always be at the back of my head. What should i do..?

57419,100787,"I have been married for about a month and the romance is dying fast, because I am discovering my husband has many weird habits whenever he thinks he's not being watched. For example, when he watches football on the couch and doesn't realize I am doing work on the table behind, he will slide his hand underneath his shorts and scratch his private parts, before bringing said hand up to his nose and taking a deep, invigorating breath, as if one were doing meditation.
Other times, the scratching results in some dirt that he rubs between his thumb and forefinger into a little grey ball of death, which he EATS. Lastly, sometimes the scratching dislodges a strand of pubic hair, which he examines with keen interest in the same way David Attenborough looks at insects on plants, before sucking on it.
I have gone down on him many times and I can assure yall that it is not Bengawan Solo down there. So why is he smelling, eating and sucking on by-products of his nether region? Do all guys do these?? How do yall cope with this disgusting side of your husbands/bfs???

This is not even because I am consevrative. I am actually very liberal. I am up for anything. It isn't even due to a lack of trying. I am on 4 dating apps and honestly it's exhausting. I barely get any matches and most people I talk to don't even proceed beyond a few messages. I usually just get ghosted. idk what I am doing wrong.
My only romantic expereince was a girlfriend I had for 6 months 5 years ago. SHe told me she was conservative and therefore wasn't comfortable doing anything sexual. But she cheated on my by sleeping with one of my friends while we were together. So clearly she was uncomfortable about me and not activity itself.
I have a lot of close female friends with whom I have very platonic relationships with. But I really crave something more. I really crave intimacy. It's not just sex but just to feel loved, feel cared for, to feel like someone in this world actually gives a shit about what happens to me. I want some level of exclusivity in my relationships. I also want to have sex with someone I love and someone who loves me and to feel that connection. I want something more than just friendship.
When I see other people in happy relationships, it makes me sad, jealous and envious. I am severely depressed because of this and idk what to do. I have been told to just focus on improving myself and that i will find a girlfriend when it is time but that is clearly bullshit advice because nothing good seems to be happening.

What happened recently made me sad. I dont think I did the wrong thing. I am not sure why people I told to pass negative comments.
I was taking the train home when I noticed a Indian man crying silently in the train. He was trying to hide it but it was clear to me. I took a seat next to him and asked him if he is okay. He did not respond. So I stood up and hugged him close to my chest. Then he started to cry more and more audiably. It was messy indeed with tears and mucus. But it did not bother me. I was more concerned he may end his life or do something drastic. I kept hugging him till the end of the journey. By this time he was rather quiet. I looked at him and he seemed tired from crying. He managed to force some smile and thanked me. He told me he was planning to end his life that day as he had a number of problems from family to financial. He said he did not know nice people like me existed. He said he sees the world differently and he will now try to live and press on.
To be frank this made me feel really good. I was really filled with joy because I felt I stopped someone from taking his life away. I felt I gave him something to live forward. Maybe for the first time he realised that a stranger can care for him a lot also.
Now the problem is my family and friends. They make comments like ""What if he molested you?"" Or things like ""An Indian, you like black issit?"". I feel sad getting all these negative comments. I would have given a hug no matter who it is - old or young, ugly or handsome, ugly or pretty, male or female. Race is also not an issue for me.

We met and had a couple of drinks. My gf insisted that I follow them to her house. They started scratching each other's itch. Suddenly, the other girl asked me to join and who would refuse. I initially thought that it would just be a one time thing. The three of us met again to scratch our itch again and again and again.

56141,97002,"During my freshman year, I attended an orientation camp and met my facilitator, a girl, who was one year my senior. I eventually fell in love with her after the camp and asked her out individually as ""friends"". However, I'm not sure if I was being ""friendzoned"" or gaslighted for almost 3 years.
1-2 times a week, we would go out, watch movies, and have dinners with just the two of us. So we went out at least once every week to just go out and talk and play. But we didn't have any skinship at all and were moving really slowly. Texts were not often, although I texted her good morning every day. We just kept going out and things didn't really progress officially beyond friends- no hand holding, kissing etc.
As I'm quite shy, I asked her if she minded getting the couple seat at Cathay. She said she's ok with it, so I got it, thinking that may be a chance to hold her hand or something. However, when I try to sit close to her in the cinema, she kept moving away. I respected her boundaries and just sat apart as well.
I would send her back after every ""date"" although she lives in the West and I live in the East. It takes 2 hours to commute back via MRT/Bus.
So we just kept going out for meals/movies/outings at least once every week for almost 1 year? I was perplexed so I texted her a long message asking if we were ""dating"", and she said that she treated me as a friend! Like wtf who goes out one-on-one like that and text ""good morning"" everyday to a friend?
Despite that, I continued on for another year as a ""friend"" who keeps going out with her alone at least 1 time per week. I even took a Korean class (which killed my GPA btw) with her to meet her more often than 1 to 2 times a week. This is because she said that she is too busy with her CCA (she's in dance) and can't meet so often.
Then I realised every Valentines' Day, she will get at least 1-2 ""confessions"" from other guys. One of them happened in the very same Korean class that I was in with her, and in the confession that guy said that she spoke to him often every night to confide in him? She denied it and said that I was being very toxic when I asked if she really did speak to this guy often at night. She said she simply treated that guy as a ""friend""?!
So I took a break from her and started dating other people. After that, when she started working as an auditor, she said she's very busy and can't spare more than one night per week with me. I said ok. So around 1-2 times per week, I would go all the way to her condo in the West to play basketball/table tennis with her, or would go cycling. Then take the 2 hour train ride all the way home. After almost a year of doing this, I asked her if we were ""dating"" again, and she said we weren't, and that she was treating me as a ""friend""?
I'm so confused. Is she leading me on on purpose? Did she ever like me? Which girl has so much free time to waste my time like this? It's almost 3 years of going out 1-2 times weekly alone, with no skinship.

I think he is just being cheap. Shouldn’t money contribution be based on percentage to be fair? I think it’s only logical what. Like if I spent 200 dollars on him that’s 10% of my salary. Even if he spends 900 dollars on me that’s more but it’s just 5% of his salary so to him it’s less what right?

56272,97241,"29/F and single and I really want to just find someone who loves me. In fact, all I ask for is for him to be faithful, gentle, and respectful. That’s it. I don’t need him to be good-looking, I don’t need him to shower me with things. I just want someone to whom I can go home to every day, with whom I can share my troubles without being lectured, and for whom I can give everything without the fear that my love for him is not being appreciated. I have spent far too long looking for the perfect guy who can sweep me off my feet but really, I just want a simple loyal family man will always be there, even though I don’t really need him to do anything for me.
Would love to hear if old-school men like that still exist in Singapore today.

55021,94204,"Me(32) and my girlfriend(29) are living together for a year and going out for two. I make about 1.5 times the amount she makes and split all our bills including rent 60-40. She has a huge student loan in low six digits. So here's the incident. Yesterday, she came up to me and asked why I was not helping pay off her student loan.I asked her whether she wants me to help plan her budget or is she expecting me to help pay of her loan. she said it was the latter. I told her I am not willing to join finances as long as we are not married. But she retorted that I have more than enough in my savings and it's unfair that I am not helping her pay off her student loan. So, I asked her if she was expecting me to take my savings and completely pay off her loan. She nodded and I started laughing uncontrollably. She got upset and has informed most of her friends and they have been calling me an asshole as I am not helping her. I would have been fine if she had asked if she could reduce her share of the bills, but for her to suggest this I don't know how else to react. She has been giving me the silent treatment since. So NUSWhispers, AITA?

My dad is offering me $10K a month to work for his distribution company and my best job offer is $4.5K at a bank. I’m a mathematics grad FCH.
I’ll be learning how to manage a company straightaway if I worked for my dad while if I got a job, I wouldn’t know what I will learn if I will learn anything at all. In addition, I will probably inherit the company in the future anyway. My dad is 68 and I am 25.
All my friends are getting jobs and they have the dignity of being able to tell people that they are out there trying to make it on their own without any help from their parents, and I will have none of that dignity, and I’ll probably be perceived as piggybacking on my family’s wealth.
I don’t know the right thing to do here. Please halp.

55686,95884,"I’m in a sticky situation and I need some advice... I graduated from chemistry PhD and has been looking for job.. Till now, the best offer is only a measly 4.5k!! Like seriously?! After all the studies, labs, PhD thesis, sleepless nights and attaining the pinnacle of education, I’m only offered 4.5k?!
Then I received an offer from a big tobacco company in Britain... they offered me almost 2.5 times of the sg salary, to R&D tobacco chemistry to enhance flavor and taste...
When I told my friends, instead of feeling happy or congratulating me, all of them criticized and despise me, judging me and saying things like tobacco is harmful for the society, how can I be such an immoral person etc etc..
Like seriously?! Who are they to impose their morality on me?! Why are they virtue signaling and riding the moral high horse... I’m especially irritated by their “supposed superior” body language, as if they are some superior and better human being..
One girl (whom I know is a super materialistic girl who worked as sugarbaby before) have the cheek to say, and I quote “ I rather earn 1k than working for tobacco company who pays me 10k”. Omg.. She is lowly educated and sell her body and dare to virtue signal to me?!
And to make things worse, both of my parents are doctors and they also start to despise me.. I’m so angry.. it’s not as if smoking is illegal!! If smoking is really so bad, why don’t all government just outlaw and ban all tobacco company? Also, it’s not as if I will smoke if I work for them. I definitely won’t smoke and I even explained my work involve chemical synthesis and analysis to enhance flavors, I won’t even inhale any tobacco extracts. And all research need proper PPE when handling potential carcinogenic extracts. As long as I’m not doing illegal things, what’s wrong?!
I’m sure if I am poor eventually, nobody will give me a single cent and they will say I didn’t work hard enough and all that... And here they are, imposing their morality and judgement on me... I’m getting scolded even more than prostitute and sugarbaby who sell their body and nobody even scold these girls, and more often than not people still find excuse for them saying they are “noble”, nothing wrong, you do you etc etc.. but when I got an offer through my own efforts and require high academic credential, I’m getting flamed?!
I guess the point of my post is to rant and also ask for help on what I should do.... should I just ignore these preachy friends and go ahead? At the end of the day, financial stability is the safest option..
But how do I deal with my parents?
And don’t post if you just want to virtue signaI... I had enough of preaching and moral high horse people... Get down your moral high horse and stop imposing your morality on others! Morality is merely an useless, subjective and empty social construct conjured to control society.. It has been changing ever since the dawn of civilization... and I’m a scientific who only believe in evidence-based science, NOT god!!
Appreciate any genuine advice...

56604,98380,"Why are people such hypocrites when it comes to killing animals for food nowadays?
I fish as a hobby and I eat the majority of what I fish, so I have no issues with killing animals with the intent of eating them.
Few days back, I invited 3 friends to my apartment and I told them I'd be preparing chilli crab for them. They were so excited over the food and one even said it's her favourite dish. I bought 4 live sri lankan crabs home and waited for my friends to arrive before processing them because I wanted to keep the food fresh.
When my friends came, they were shocked that I bought live crabs. I told them it's for freshness. The friend who said chilli crab was her favourite dish started arguing with me, calling me a murderer.
I told her to look away and proceeded to kill the crabs swiftly with a knife up the bottom and she started crying. My other friends were split, with one supporting her and saying I'm a monster, while the other said I am just doing what every restaurant does.
I called her a hypocrite for eating crabs at a restaurant even though she can't stand the crabs being killed, and she couldn't come out with a proper reply. Needless to say the gathering sucked and she ran home crying with one other friend. This left the 2 of us to eat 4 crabs and it was absolutely delicious.
Animal cruelty starts at the dinner table and I admit I am cruel to animals for the sake of food. But at least I'm no hypocrite.

57196,100010,"Hi Prof Ben and other married people here, i would like to seek your views on how married couples should split their finances on both big ticket items (wedding banquet, wedding bands, renovations, furnitures, kids) and day to day expenses (groceries, utilities, monthly housing repayment).
I just had the money talk with my fiancee last night and she said that she's hoping that we can apportion the expenses according to our salary. I am currently earning about 1.5x more than her so she expects me to contribute more. She cited the following reasons:
1. I earn significantly more than her
2. She just paid off her study loan
3. She has to support her mum because she is in poor health and can no longer work but barely has enough for retirement.
We are getting married end of this year and our flat will be ready sometime next year. My grandma is getting older and really hopes to see her great grandchild before she passes away. My fiancee on the other hand is hesitant about having a child so soon because she thinks that she will struggle financially if she has to support both her mum and a child. She would feel more secure having more financial support from me, in the event that her career gets affected due to the pregnancy.
I think i understand her situation but i cannot help but feel a little unfair that as a man i am expected to pay more. On a positive note, i am thankful that she does not ask for luxury bags on anniversaries or birthdays.
