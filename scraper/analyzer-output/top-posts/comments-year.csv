59713,105286,"Hi all, just wanted to let something off my chest. So… I have 4 siblings which are all brothers.( I am a guy btw) The 5 of us are very close since young and we always share things like usage of car, clothes etc.
We are all working adults now and 4 of my brothers can’t find their right one (they are middle age men now). I felt bad for them and asked my wife if she is willing to have sex with my brothers and have a child with each of them to boost their self esteem.
In which, she agreed. (With conditions like 100k for each child birth ) She then had sex with my oldest brother about 5 years ago. Which I have regretted this decision and really defeated every inch of my soul. I cried very badly outside their room that night. Since then she had sex with my 3 other brothers occasionally. I act like I am okay in front of them. But in fact it was killing me inside, each time they had sex.
Today, we each have one child. When I look at my brother’s child, I felt sadness and emptiness in my heart. I start to question myself “what if this child does better than my child”, “what if my wife likes this child better than our child, which cause an impact on our relationship”.
I start to think a lot since the start of the sex with my brothers, which really impacted my mental health a lot as I did not mention to them about my feelings as I do not wish to ruin our relationship, both brother and wife.
I started to have depression and have sucidal thoughts after one month my wife had sex with my oldest brother. Even though this is transactional, but I still felt really bad and felt that my self worth is worse than a bag full of dirt.
Today, when we go out as a family, me, my 4brothers, wife and 5 childrens. I felt very insecure and wish to die everyday. I do not know what is the point in living already. Btw the children all acknowledge me as the dad. As registered in the all their birth cert.
All in all, I do not know why I suggest such a stupid idea. And I really f regret it to the core of my soul.
Please advise how to cope with this… I don’t think I can tahan already

58767,103458,"I have been dating my bf for a while but there are some points that I just cannot shrug off.
The expectation is that a guy should be at least a head taller than his girlfriend, but this is something that can only happen in my dream. The reason is he is only 2cm taller and not even 175cm, meaning that it feels like he is a sister/pal to me rather than an oppa. He is way too short for a guy and it doesnt give me a strong sense of security. I estimate he is in the lower tier of height range perhaps somewhere between 1.70-1.73m.
In fact, I would like to ask my fella ladies out there who are willing to date shorter guys or even marry them. What do you see in them? Dont you regret it after a while or will make this an issue whenever you start quarreling? There are plenty of bigger fishes out there and I am now starting to regret it.
Before you commentors start bashing me, I will be fair and point out some of his merits along with my concerns.
1. Yes, he is pretty good looking and has a nice heart. He often shows care for cats/dogs and feed them but I find this trait less manly and somewhat gross. A real man should be more aggressive, not like a beta sissy that plays with small animals.
2. He often buys lunch for me and brings it to the secondary school where I am teaching. However, sometimes kaypoh students will come to me and ask ""Cher, your boyfriend ah? Legit? Why so short one?""- Not surprising since even my female students are taller than him. This is ridiculously embarassing. I even told my bf not to bring lunch to me but he doesnt get my point... He will just say "" If we are truly in love, we shouldnt care what others say""..... Yeah right you are not the teacher...
3. He will offer to carry the plastic bags whenever we go shopping. The problem is his legs are short so his hands are like in close proximity to the ground, resulting in some long plastic bags being dragged, even though I understand he doesnt mean it. This is pretty unsightly.
4. He is a mathematician and I remembered once he drew me a heart using math equations. This seems romantic to others but lame in my eyes. If he is sincere, he would have drawn the heart by hand, not indulge in these kinds of boring stuff. After all, how can all these math help him in his future prospect? I knew of a few friends already earning big bucks without knowledge of maths.
I do not not wish to elaborate any further because for every merit that I can think of, it is diluted by the negative aspects. They cant even offset his midget stature.
Unfortunately, all the good quality tall guys are already taken by the short girls, otherwise I would have ended this relationship earlier. I do not want my female besties to find out that I broke up, so I will just bear with it for a while.
My message to my fella sisters out there who are currently attached to the shorter guys. It is never too late to back out! Think of your future!

58649,103251,"I've been together with my boyfriend for 3 years. Last year he graduated and found a job that pays him $3.5k a month. To be honest I was shocked that his salary is quite low. Because some of my friends and cousins are earning much higher than him. I often encouraged him to find a better job. I also asked him to take up some courses to improve his chances. He already took up a few courses but he still couldn't find a better job.
Recently, I was bored and downloaded a dating app for fun. Surprisingly, I matched with a lot of guys who seem quite eligible. I even matched with a lawyer and an investment associate. I have been chatting with the investment associate for two weeks now. He would text me only a few times a day because he's a very busy guy. Yesterday was his birthday so he told me he celebrated his birthday with his family at home.
After his birthday celebration, he suddenly said he wants to see me. At around 3am, he snuck out of his house and drove to my house to see me. I went down to the carpark to meet him and was quite surprised to see that he drives a luxury car and he looks even better in real life. We chatted for 2 hours in his car. He then walked me to the lift and even kissed me on my cheek. Although we barely know each other, I actually feel quite happy that he kissed me. When he reached home, he texted me to say that he enjoyed talking to me and he would like to see me again.
He seems like a really nice guy. I know I shouldn't compare but my bf isn't even that nice. And my bf is unable to find a decent job so I'm worried about my future when we get married. But my bf and I have been together for 3 years so our relationship is very stable. I feel like if I break up with him now, 3 years of my life would be wasted. What should I do? Should I just stick to my bf because he is obviously a safer choice? Or should I continue to go out with the investment guy and then break up with my bf when the investment guy confess to me?

57933,101855,"Need to rant. My ex-boyfriend is so cheapskate. Today he suddenly texted me and asked me if I could return him the engagement ring that he proposed to me with.
We dated for 4 years before he proposed to me in August last year. A month later, he quit his job because he wanted to start a business with his friends. I then broke up with him as I felt very disappointed with his stupid start-up dreams. Fortunately I met someone new at my workplace who’s way more mature and financially stable than him so I managed to quickly move on.
So today he told me he would like to sell the engagement ring as he would like to expand his business. I asked him why bother selling this ring as it’s not that expensive anyway. He then said that this ring costs alot to him as he saved up for 2 years to buy it because he knew that it was my dream to own this ring. Playing the sympathy card. Yikes.
To be honest this ring is not really super expensive, at most $60k? So I don’t understand why he is so determined to take it back. I am seriously disgusted with how thick-skinned he is, how he tries so hard to convince me to return him the ring. Somemore he already know that it is my dream to own this ring.
But when I told my friends about this, they all told me I should return him the ring and support him in his start-up dream and then ask my current boyfriend to buy me a new one. Seriously how to support such stupid dream? So should I return him the ring or not? I have the right to reject him right?

He is always by my side whenever I feel depress, cheering me up with magic tricks. Although he knew that I'm already attached, he continued to shower me with affection and love. Instead of rejecting him, I led him on by asking him to hug me when I'm sad. Kiss him on the cheek when he sent me back home. (Well, as long as I didn't engage in s**ual activity with him, I'm not cheating on my bf) .
I did clearly explained to him that, there is a very low probability of me becoming his gf. However, he gave me a shocking reply that touched my heart deeply and brought me to tears. Although he knew that he has little or no chance, he is unwilling to abandon a vulnerable girl like me. He wants to stay by my side to protect my fragile heart until the day I no longer needs him. When that day arrives, he will cut all contacts from me in order to nurse his emotional wounds.

59822,105532,"When you cause me so much anger and pain and not see what you have done to me.
She was my gf for almost a year. Out of the few girls that I've dated, she was the hottest one. I admit I am a very confident man. I workout and lift weights and I am tall at 1.85cm while she's 1.65cm. I always believe we look very good together and I am the envy of many men for having her as my gf. People always look our way when we walk past and I was sure it's because we are a very good looking couple.
We always argued. I was often angry. She cannot see how much frustration she has brought me. She cannot see when its clearly her fault when things happen. I don't believe no other guys are chasing her when we are together and I admit I let my anger get the better of me sometimes. She has many unknown calls and she would always deny it when I ask if it's from other guys. If you have unknown calls why won't you delete it if it's really from a stranger? Why keep the number on the log? A few times she threw her phone because she was so angry by what I've found on her phone and social media. If you have nothing to hide, why get mad? I deleted all her phone numbers as I was sure she was saving numbers under girls names when its actually guys numbers.
I kept saying she will cheat on me one day and she really left me one day. Then she got together with another guy barely 2 months after we broke up. I was still in the process of trying to get her back as we always patch back but it stopped working. So many times I caught him sending her home and it made me so mad. I made sure she remembers I will forever be single thanks to a cheater like her. Towards the end it was really ugly and I wanted to get back at her. I didn't want to give her the satisfaction so I destroyed everything of hers that she left at my home. I never forgot the way she insulted me. I did hope she is never happy forever for how she ended our relationship. I made sure she heard even my mum cursed her for causing me so much unhappiness.
That guy she dated was so short. I don't know what she sees in him. I always believed she got together with him to spite me. I was sure he can't satisfy her better than me. He don't even have half my stature or presence. He doesn't even drive a car like me. I find it unbelieveable that after me, she actually married that short guy and had a child with him.
I cannot get over the fact after leaving me, she married the first guy who wanted her. I know how to enjoy life while she chose to suffer with that poor short chap? When I meet or bump into mutual friends who also knows her, I feel my anger and bitterness coming back each time. I purposely flirted with her besties once when I bumped into them. I wanted them to tell her how happy and happening I am without her. And I have no lack of women surrounding me.
A part of me deeply wishes she suffer whenever I am reminded of her. I even purposely move around her workplace hoping she will bump into me and I hope she regrets letting me go as I am successful and earn more than her dwarf husband now.
I hope you remember me forever because you've been such a horrible person to me.

59394,104674,"My girlfriend doesn’t want to work, and she hasn’t worked throughout our relationship. She wants the taitai life because her father is rich and her mother got to be a housewife. So I have been supporting both of us with my pay alone, which is not much, and I don’t get to save even though I have been working for years. We are living paycheck to paycheck, which was okay for me last time but now that we are talking about long-term, I’m not sure if I can live like this forever.
I get stressed about our BTO thinking about the money I need to fork out, but she will just tell me to find another job that has higher pay and she even told me to borrow from my family. Her family doesn’t want to lend us the money for our house, because my girlfriend has never contributed to the family business. She has been pressuring me to get money from my family whenever I bring up about financial issues, but my family is just a low to medium income family. I have tried borrowing and even forced money from my family members and it has caused a lot of arguments.
We have been living together and she doesn’t do housework either, my parents are the ones doing all the housework while she just does nothing at home and watch her dramas. She doesn’t even offer to buy meals for my parents when they are at home.
She insists that I propose with a diamond ring which will take months for me to save up for, otherwise she says it will make her look bad and she will not marry me, which is why I’m in a dilemma now. I feel that she doesn’t care about my financial pressures and she’s willing to make me suffer for what she wants.
In case you are wondering..she’s not very attractive either. We are both considered unattractive, which is why I hesitate to break up because I know I can’t find someone else. I’ve been wanting to lose weight but she insists I stay fat so I won’t attract other girls, but I am concerned about my health as well.
What should I do?

59415,104714,"I'm with my girlfriend for 3 years. She's been bugging me to marry her and its really starting to stress me out. I didn't tell her I actually have a 6 figure savings accumulated from my deceased father's will on top of my own assets and let her think I'm a pauper. She even gave me money once when she thought my family finances was tight but I rejected it. A part of me decided she is the one after she did that.
My mother told me to never flaunt our wealth so as not to attract the wrong people so I guess I start to feel funny about money since young. We mostly go to hawkers and only visit restaurants when there is a special occasion like birthdays or Christmas. Our dates are usually very low costs. I like that when the weather permits, we have the habit of alighting earlier from the train or bus and spend more time walking together and talking to reach our destination.
I lied to her that we can't afford a flat yet and she showed hand me her savings and say she can and kept asking me not to waste her time in a joking way. Her family is pretty well to do. Her dad even gifted her a car when she got promoted but she sold it as she's not confident driving.
The problem I have with my gf may be insignificant to some couples. I don't really have any major red flags or issues about her. Even if she's not my gf, I would think of her as a great person to have around. I know other men will find her very eligible given her looks, personality and family background. My mother loves her and already considers her a daughter in law. But I have a but. I'm not ready. We are in our late 20s.
How do you become ready? I'm so in love with her but I just couldn't make myself get down on one knee and ask for her hand in marriage.

58807,103530,"tl;dr: I cheated with my female colleague and I feel very bad about it. What made it worse was that my wife witnessed the cheating…
I'm happily married with a wonderful wife with two kids. I work in marketing in an FMCG company and I'm constantly surrounded by younger female colleagues. Ngl, many of them are very attractive but I'm a faithful man who thinks with his bigger head.
However my life recently turned upside down. There's this female colleague who recently joined, let's call her G. G is in her late twenties and has a face and figure many women would die for and many men would go for. I was so surprised to find out that she was single (she gave me that information without me asking). G would constantly ask me for advice dealing with work matters and invite me to go lunch together with her batch. Sometimes we go for lunches and it's just the two of us. G would constantly ask me what I was doing over the weekend and tell me what her plans were. She was actively using dating apps but none of the guys were up to her standards. She would often flirt with me (I think?) Like when we are alone she would playfully brush my arms and sometimes bump into me (too often for it to be by accident). She’d also tell me about her experiences with her dates and how they're not good, and I'm so much better. I always felt a weird sensation whenever I hear that from her. It’s a nice feeling to be validated, but I’m married and it feels wrong.
One fateful day, as my wife had to use the car that day, she came to my office to pick me up. As I was walking away from the office with my wife, G somehow appeared out of nowhere and said hi to us and was extremely friendly towards my wife. G and my wife started chatting as if they were besties and they somehow ended up organizing a games night at my place that weekend. G said she’d bring her date over.
Fast forward to that day, G came with her date. Not sure why but I felt a tinge of jealousy seeing him. We decided to play some card games and I ended up partnering with G. This is when things went down. G was secretly texting me the cards she had in her hand and signaled me to read my phone. I got the hint and was trying to discreetly look at my phone. However, my wife caught me doing that and snatched my phone away and she saw the message from G. She acted like it was ok but after G and date left, she was so furious that I cheated with G during the games and my wife refuses to talk to me now.
How can I appease my wife?

59530,104917,"I'm currently dating a teacher for about 2 years, who is 3 years into the job (after PGDE). While we really love each other and are serious about one another, I'm a bit uncertain about our future together due to her workload and commitment to work.
Here is a sample of her average day:
Wake up at 540am
Leave house at 630am
Reach school by 710am
Teach classes till 130-2pm
CCA/ remedials/ meetings/ misc things till 530pm, leave school
Dabao, Reach home at 630pm
Eat dinner and chill to 8pm
Marking from 8 to 1130pm
Shower, etc, till 1230pm
Catch up on emails till 1am then sleep
So based on that, she works maybe 14-15 hours every weekday with just 4.5hrs of sleep and a good day every weekend just to catch up on work that couldn't be completed and lesson plans. Based on her salary, it's just ridiculous how much she has to work for that - Retail and F&B workers are better paid hourly than her.
I've been getting into fights with her and telling her that her lifestyle and is unsustainable as it'll lead to big burnouts and her health will suffer. On the flip end, she says that I'm not a teacher and I'd never understand her line of work.
Also, I realised that a lot of her teacher friends (female), are single well into late 30s and 40s - which I guess its due to their teaching lifestyle. On the flip end, most women I know from my line of work (private) are married by their late 30s.
I sincerely hope MOE can do something to lighten teacher's workloads. While that is wishful thinking, I'm wondering if I could get any advice on how to move forward...or move on.
Frankly I although I love her a lot, she had made it clear that her priority is to be a good teacher. So at the back of my mind, there is always this feeling that she loves teaching more than me.
Also, although we both agreed on having children, based on her workload, I don't see how we would be able to manage as I'm afraid she'll leave majority of the child rearing to me while she continues her passion. My job is way less tiring than hers and honestly I'm earning more than double of her - and in order for me to climb more, I need her to do her fair share of child rearing. I've mentioned to her that if we got married, I'd like for her to take a step back from her overloaded schedule and this was utterly shot down and more quarrels ensured.
So now I'm at a crossroads - should I push on and try to make things work, or try to move on to find someone who able to be more family oriented?

58900,103714,"I fell for a Siam bu.
Before u guys judge me, please hear me out. I often frequent Thai disco / Siam Diu as a means to de-stress. I find that the loud music and spinning lights help take the stress away from my work.
Like any other visit, I sat at my usual spot when a petite silhouette from afar caught my attention. Her round eyes, sharp nose, and elongated legs is what many would consider ""attractive"". Not to mention that her long and silky hair that is constantly brushing against her shoulder line; any man would subconsciously gravitate toward her and I was no exception.
I could not help but to glance in her direction without making it too obvious. I got caught eventually and we exchanged eye contact for a good 10 seconds. She understood the assignment and came over for a chat. As we began sharing more about each other, I realized that we have many things in common. We immediately clicked as though we had known each other right from the beginning. She introduced herself as ""Moon.""
At that moment, I felt as though I had found my soulmate. Talking to Moon made me forget about my fatigue from work. It was as though time had stopped. Deep down, I was sincerely hoping that the conversation could last forever. Time flew quickly, and before I knew it, the place was closing for the night. We exchanged contact and parted ways.
The next day, my phone rang. On answering, I was greeted by a familiar voice. It was Moon. My face lit up knowing that I could connect with her again. We agreed to meet up at a Thai restaurant called NaNa at Golden mille.
NaNa restaurant is a famous Thai restaurant in SG. Moon claimed to be a frequent patron of the place as their food tasted close to home. She even use the opportunity to teach me the name of the dishes in Thai. Halfway through our meal, she was rudely interrupted by a phone call which led her to leaving the restaurant. She claimed that she had something urgent to attend to, and needed to excuse herself. She sounded anxious.
Feeling concerned, I quickly paid the tab and followed her. I was soon led to one of the floor exits where I found her seated on the stairs and sobbing uncontrollably. I approached her to check on her. My presence caught her off guard and, almost immediately, she apologized for leaving me alone in the restaurant. She then went on to explain what happened. Turns out, her mom was terminally ill, and needed money for her operation. Sympathizing with her plight, I agreed to help her out without much hesitation.
As I was about to get up and make the withdrawal. She grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her. She gave me a peck on my cheek to express her gratitude. Things got heated up and we made love in a public space. Despite the shabby location, the sex was good and memorable. The day ended on a good note with her settling her family matters with my financial support.
That incident pulled us closer as we started hanging out more. Despite numerous warnings from my friends and family about her intention, I chose to believe her as I felt that the society perception towards hostress is based on stereotypes. Things, however, did get dubious when she started asking for more money...
P.S I realized the story is getting too lengthy and I apologized. I'll split the story and post the part two if the post hits 200 likes

If a women post about her sugarbook experience, she is empowering, brave, not constrained by the limits and expectations of society. If a man post about his sugarbook experience, he is a scumbag.
When a man wants to split expenses 50-50, he is calculative, not generous, dump him. When a women wants to split housework 50-50, it is equality.
Just like how guys should mind their own business and not care about what girls wear, why should girls not mind their own business and not care about how guys spend their money.
In this day and age, equality is only used when it suits the narrative of females, otherwise it is why are you not gentlemanly enough.

I applied to this job in a manufacturing firm and my job role is more business related. After clearing the interviews, they told me they are keen to hire me and I am keen to join them too. They will be discussing salary and HR matters in a few days time. After gathering some info, this company pays additional increments for NS experience although it is not civil service or defence/ military related. I want to use my officer background to ask for higher pay. The reasons I can think of are
1. Only a minority and better performing NSFs gets selected to OCS. Being able to complete officer training demonstrates resilience and commitment.
2. As an officer, I learned leadership skills, organizational skills, management skills, planning skills etc which can also be applied in corporate world.
3. An officer held bigger responsibilities than the average soldier.
4. An officer is generally fitter than the average guy.
Are these reasons strong enough to ask for a higher salary? If not, what else should I do?

I can’t stand such a mummy’s boy & honestly it’s a my dealbreaker for me if I’d known about his habit when we were dating. I visit my in-laws once to two times a week. It’s not like they can’t update each other then. Rmb it’s not emergency stuff that they’re updating each other everyday. She also doesn’t have major health issues.
She is very reliant on him on everything. She & her husband are moving to an estate close to us soon & I’m worried my hubby will run every small errand his parents esp. his mother asks of him simply because he chats with her everyday. His mother asks him to do errands even when they live far apart, not to mention when they move near to us.
Guys, do you call your mum everyday to update her about your day. I’m a girl and I don’t even do that! It’s creepy.
I’ve sounded this out to him by saying, ‘How come your mum calls you everyday?’ But he thinks nothing of it & doesn’t get the hint that I’m disgusted by it. How can I make it clearer to him that he & his mum’s call routine is creepy? He may just hide, call & whisper in the toilet if I make it any more obvious. Sorry, their kind of co-dependency sh*t & intimacy just borders on incest even though it’s not. It’s simply not healthy.

60172,106218,"My advice to all young gentlemen out there
Don’t get married. Yep. I said it. DO NOT GET MARRIED. It’s a scam that’s so normalized that nobody even realizes it’s a scam.
I mean it. And I am not some bitter old man. On the surface I appear to be a moderately successful professional married to another (seemingly) successful white collar professional, and let me tell u… I am miserable af.
Marriage is basically like doing half the household chores like a housemate (nowadays the girls all want to split household chores), and yet you’ll be paying for everything, fetching her around like a taxi driver, carrying her shopping bags, and whole be busy helping somebody’s dustyass daughter run errands.
God only knows why I signed up for this shit show. My life would probably have been a lot better if I didn’t get married and remained single.
Don’t just take my word for it. ALL of my married gentlemen friends regret getting married and none of them would want to get married again if they could turn back the clock.
Some of them are now divorced, and still having to co-parent with a shitty ass girl who’s out to make their lives miserable & on top of that are horrible shitty mothers.
Most girls nowadays aren’t looking for a husband. They just want a new daddy who can pamper them like princesses. Bonus if the new daddy is good looking and/ or has a nice body they can get whacked by at night. That’s all they’re after.
I’ve no doubt that the comments will be filled with these pathetic woman-children whining about how women bring nothing to the table.
We are the whole dining room set from IKEA, b*tch. We make our own money, we buy our own shit, we can cook our own meals and we can make ourselves cum better than u ever can.
What do *YOU* bring to the table, besides a bland AF personality (hehe bubble tea is my personality, I love K-pop uwu), zero dress sense (let me guess- your whole wardrobe is from Taobao & Charles and Keith), average pay check ($3-5k LOL) and average boobs (A/B LOL)?
So pls for the love of God, gentlemen don’t get married. Listen to me. Don’t make the same shitty mistake I and along with so many other ladies made. You’ll thank me in the future when you watch all your other friends get married and then divorced.
And the G wonders why the marriage and birth rate are dropping year after year. Look at the quality of the guys. Totally CMI.
The gentlemen have been stepping up and most of us are doing household chores and cooking great food, contributing to the household; as compared to our parents generation.
But women? Can’t even fry an egg to save her own life, and have to rely on grab to order every dinner. Yet every expense don't wanna pay. Hard pass.
If you’re already engaged it’s not too late. Call it off. I don’t care if you’ll lose money. Better to lose money than your time. It’s also much worse and much more expensive to get a divorce.
If you’re dating, just date her for fun. Date her yo satisfy your own needs and for companionship, but focus on your own career and yourself. Don’t need to get too serious. Treat her as a fun hobby. Nothing more. No need to legally bind yourself to one person. Women's charter isn't funny.
And if she’s not treating u like an absolute king while you’re dating, PLS don’t waste your time. She’s not going to step her game up after marriage. If she’s not at least a 9.5/10 during courtship, don’t bother. It’s only downhill from there. If she’s only a 5-6 now, he will be a 1-2 after marriage. Confirm plus chop. Don’t say nobody tried to warn u.

58793,103506,"Manly guys should be hairy - that has been my opinion since puberty, so I have never shaved in my life, and I admire my armpit hair at least once a day in front of the mirror. I like exercising topless at parks and gyms, where I spend most of my time at the pull-up bars so I can flaunt my hairy armpits and make manly grunts that would arouse the opposite s**. However, the number of girls who would look lustfully in my direction has diminished over the years to an alarming zero.
To combat this, recently I have taken to frequenting nearby 7-11s after my workout, giving a free show of my topless sweaty body to any surrounding females. I even raise my arms in the pretense of stretching so that they can enjoy an unimpeded view of my erotic armpits, but even the cashier avoided my gaze. I don't know what else I can do apart from bellowing out loud: ""BEHOLD MY MANLY ARMPIT HAIR!""
Are girls these days brainwashed by those hairless feminine sissies from BTS and other Kpop boybands to the extent that they no longer appreciate a proper manly, hairy male?

59379,104651,"So i've been with my gf for about 1 year already. We met at friends gathering and i chased her for about 3 months. At first it's always the sweet, happy moments but nowadays, i have always been tolerating her unreasonable actions.
1) We worked at the same place. She always demand that i drive car and pick her up. I live a bit nearer to the workplace and sometimes if it's raining and it'll last till next morning, she will come over my place to stay overnight but she have a lot of demands and she's very easily emotional. There was once where she have no appetite when mine parents specially cooked dishes for her, she just say no appetite and went back to room. i told mine mum she not feeling well. just keep some for her, i later bring into room for her. End up i'm the one eating while she went to order grabfoods?
2) I brought her n mum for shopping, so mine mum was those that feel cold easily while gf was the opposite. So when we was in the car otw to shopping mall. I lowered the aircon for mine mum and my gf was the shouting about mine actions and saying that by doing so, i don't care about her, i'm a Mama's Boy.
3) There was one day where she woke up n ignored me then started being very emotional. i asked her why n she just give me that stare n no words (she not on her period). Later that day, she said she dreamed of me cheating on her with other girls and said that she had that dream because i don't give her enough attentions for her to feel secure in a relationship.
4) After dating about 1 year, she met mine family but she's always delaying for me to meet her family. Said what next time, i haven't gotten to her kind of standard for me to meet her family etc. It's really tiring n hurtful to tolerate her actions and giving ur best to her while she just think i am still not up to her standard.

59924,105754,"This is a story that I never told anyone which i should be ashamed but isn’t.
I was 15 when I first met him while playing ml. He was 29. We got matched in the classic game and my stupid ass think he was a god for having 30/1. so i added him and invite him to another game. he ended up with some 20+/0.
I eventually got him to mentor me after pestering on in game chat, hearing his voice the first time made my heart skipped. I would wait for him to get online everyday so I could play with him and listen to his voice. Eventually we started talking on whatsapp. One day i received a text to stay clear of him, it was only then that i knew he had a gf, my heart sank. We didn’t flirt or anything, to me he was that invincible senpai that i admire. i blocked him everywhere the next day.
During my 16th birthday, he texted me, happy birthday in ml. I joked that i wanted a meal for present. we met the very first time in real life after school. he took me to swenson, which to me is like the mother of all restaurant.(I apologize for my 16 year old self) i sat across him, getting a good look at him, it’s great to finally put a face to his voice. He looked like a nerdy Fresh Grad Teacher and yeah that’s like my weakness? We had our meal and catch up a lot on our lives.
After Lunch, he send me home. I don’t know what got over me but i kissed him on the lips for the first time at the lift lobby upon realizing what i had done i ran up the stairs back home and blocked him again.
I kept thinking about the kiss for the next one year and eventually got into JC. Again on my birthday he texted me happy birthday again. But I did not reply because I stalk him on his ig to know that he’s still attached and I didn’t want break their relationship of 5 years.
Extremely stressed over my A lvl and also completely couldn’t get over him, I told myself that if he texted me on my birthday i would hook up to him and get him out of my system. If he doesn’t then i’ll completely give up on him. I know it’s morally wrong to hook up with someone with a gf but it’s driving me crazy. I waited everyday for that day to come reminding myself of what i promised myself.
He did message me Happy birthday. so I took the chance to invite him to repair my computer. (i know it’s a lame excuse i was 18). i met him on the following thursday at noon after school. Upon entering my house, i bolted the door, scaring my parents might come home early. i led him to my room which i locked the door behind. I pushed him onto the bed and after a short persuasion he eventually fell for the temptation.
We agree to keep it physical and behind his gf for a Year. Fast forward, I enjoyed every moment that I spent with him, the memories we had will always be precious. I’ve since return him to his gf as promised and cut ties.
I am 21 now, it’s been two years since he last wish me happy birthday. Even though i misses him, i’ve gotten him out of my system, some part of me still wants him but it’s not that strong. i sometime wonder if I’ll ever find another guy like him.
Dear Ed*****,
I never regretted being yours, I’m glad that it was you. Thank you for fulfilling my unreasonable request. I just wish you’d say happy birthday to me next year. Hope you stay with your gf forever!
Dear GF,
Sorry for stealing your bf for an entire year. I know i’m selfish, but i hope you'll never find out. if you do, please forgive him.

It's settled."" Unfortunately, his outstretched arm featured a ginormous ARMPIT STAIN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

59659,105180,"Generally, I find that Malaysian gals seems to be of better calibre than our local ones.
Firstly, they are hardworking. Most of these ladies who I know dont mind working overtime or help to cover the duties of those who are on leave. Most of the time, they are the last to leave the workplace based on my observation. On the other hand, the locals are usually the first to zao, even before 6pm.
Secondly, even for those who do not have the opportunity for higher education and end up doing sales in shopping malls, they are usually quite friendly and polite to customers. They understand basic etiquette, unlike some local staff, full of snobbish attitude.
Moreover, they seem to be better looking even without makeup, compared to the local ones with thick fake lashes. They know how to dress up and are demure, compared to the local boorish ones.
Figure-wise, they are more petite and slim, hence are suitable for local guys. Most of the local ones I know do not know how to take good care of their body and have a high BMI. They may be relatively taller, but the horizontal aspect remains questionable...
Could diet and culture play an important role in explaining this big discrepancy?

This started mid last year and we both secretly get together whenever we are alone at home. I started developing feelings for her when once she helped me with a body massage. Things escalated from there and now I’m unable to stop myself. We click very well and i think there’s a big attraction between us.
We do keep our personal moments off from the family time. When it comes to her work and household chores she takes care of everything very well. She has never taken advantage of the situation and failed to work properly because of our affair.
The problem is i think my mum (staying with us) sensed something recently and ever since she has been insisting on sending our helper back home. She keeps finding fault with her which was not the case in the past. I really don’t want her to be sent back as this is not her fault. She has a family to feed back home and i feel very guilty.
But I can’t speak about this to anyone. I can’t even bring myself to ask my friends for advice. I’m also very worried that my mum might say something about this to my husband. Till date he hasn’t sensed anything and I didn’t deprive him of anything because of what i get with our helper. But I’m just very scared and worried.

Me and my gf now trying to bto and get married soon after 3 years of dating.

Last week, my gf brought me to meet her family for the very first time to discuss about our marriage. That was when I first met her sister and realised she was the one I ghosted when I was 18 yo after we slept tgt. I ghosted her because she lied about her age on tinder. I won’t disclose her sister’s age but it was a one time thing and I felt horrible after knowing the truth.
I pretended that I didn’t recognised the sister during the dinner and kept calm so that my gf won’t suspect anything. Everything went well until later that night I received a text msg from her sister, asking if I rmb what happened 5 years ago and asked why I ghosted her. She also said that she couldn’t stop thinking about me and felt very hurt after I ghosted her.
I just told her that I was only looking for hookups on tinder during that time and got hurt because she lied about her age. I also told her to keep this a secret from my gf and just let it go as it was 5 years ago where we were still young and not know better. She agreed that we should let it go. This conversation happened earlier this year, so it has been awhile.
But recently, my gf has been asking me about my past hookups/rls. This make me panic a lot because I told her before about my past, so I don’t know why she is asking it now. I suspect her sister told her smtg because my gf keep asking me what exactly did I do 5 years ago when I was in my dating app phase. Do I come clean to her and tell her about her sister as I only had one hookup during that phase and ntg more? Or do I just say I had one hookup and not tell her it’s her sister? What should I do?

At this rate all the good ones are getting hunted by all these rich old man. To the girls, Isn't it really disgusting to date someone almost 1.5 times older than you?

Lately, I received a warning from her husband via a call, telling me to leave her for good. I didnt really felt comfortable with that message and thus decided to compete with him. ( I am not one who gives up easily)
The justifications are as follows:
1. They dont have a child yet
2. I am a blackbelt in karate and I fear no threats. The more one pushes me, the more I will resist.
3. She might be in an abusive relationship given her husband's tone, I need to save her from this toxic relationship.

59347,104595,"Met 2 guys from dating app around the same time, now both are starting to hint that they wanna date me exclusively. But I don’t know who to choose :(
So Guy A is totally my type in terms of looks. Due to similar upbringing and educational
background, we have a lot of common conversation topics and on top of that he has good sense of humour. We also share a liking for one particular sport which we do together weekly. He lives in HDB and doesn’t drive, his family is not rich but lives a comfortable life. He was a scholar back in uni and now holding a managerial position in MNC. He is very capable at work, generally street smart and carries himself well around people. Only weaknesses I noted so far 1) He doesn’t show much concern when I have a bad day or when i am sick, not really sure if he doesn’t know how to comfort me or just can’t be bothered. 2) He doesn’t like to plan dates so usually is either I plan or we do things impromptu. He does try to accommodate to my love language that is quality time and we spend quite a lot of time together despite his busy schedule.
Guy B is not bad looking too, although not exactly my type. He comes from affluent family, owns a condo and drives. He holds a decent job, but I happened to know he is actually a uni dropout and got the job through his parents’ connections. He is not as smart / capable as guy A but personality wise he is more warm and caring. He is very talkative so there is never awkward silence between us, but as time passes, I notice he does most of the talking and we don’t have much common topics to talk about. We also have no common interest. He is very generous with gifts and he brought me to nice places for dates. He openly tells me he is serious about me and hopes to settle down with me soon, something that guy A never brought up before. He even brought me home and introduced me to his family although we are not together yet.
In short, I feel like I get along better with guy A and more attracted to him as he is smarter and more capable, but guy B seems to be a better guy to settle down with given his financial stability and caring nature. Hence the dilemma. I am approaching 30 soon and hoping this relationship will be my last.
Just wanna get the crowd’s opinion on who you will choose and why.

So one day I jio him bowling near my house and I invited my crush along.....
All is going well as usual he's making his jokes etc. and my crush is laughing.
Halfway through our second game, he's got 7 strikes in a row and he just rolls up his sleeves, boom what I see was a AP worth at least $100k
There my crush goes asking him all's sort of new questions etc. and she's basically throwing herself at him....
My heart sank, he saw all this and texted me ""bro let's test her"".
So I said oh I have to go etc. and left her and him there
What happened was she asked him to ""teach"" her how to bowl and was touchy.
Lied she stayed in the same neighborhood as him just to get a ride in his car...btw he doesn't use his family car at all, he said he'll get his own.
When he said oh no I like the MRT it's faster for me, she said ""you are a rich guy you must have a nice car right??""
He ""my family has their own car which is for them to use not me""
She called his family selfish....
So she then asked if they can hangout at his place (landed home).
She spent the rest of the evening trying to sleep with him after seeing all the expensive paintings in his house, and his dad's friends rolls Royce.
Whom she assumed it belonged to his family....
After he told her he ain't interested she came crawling back to me
What should I do?

58648,103256,"My girlfriend and I met in the first year of uni. when I first lay my eyes on her, I knew she was the one. However, there was only one problem: she was attached. But I was going to overcome this hurdle nonetheless, afterall we were studying in an overseas uni and her boyfriend was in the army. I knew I could come in between their LDR - it was just a matter of time.
In addition, I knew i had a height advantage - I was 190cm and he was only 172cm. I feel like my looks are above average as well so I think that helped me in a way. On a normal day, I would ask when she was going to call her boyfriend so I could give her time and space. But in my heart I secretly wanted her all for myself.
I waited patiently, for my time to strike. It had been a few weeks now and I thought about how to disrupt their daily calls as they were still going strong. Thus, I had to purposely ask her to go for random courses and classes in the evening, as that was the only time she could call her boyfriend (due to the time difference between singapore and UK). Slowly but steadily, she started to reschedule or even cancel the calls with her boyfriend - to my pleasure.
She slowly grew attached to me, and told me some heartfelt thoughts like how she felt distant with her boyfriend. She asked me for advice of what to do and obviously I had to sow discord between them and even made her doubt their relationship.
In addition, I used a fake instagram account that I bought online to mask myself as some ex classmate of hers (let's call her Jane) and saying things like how her bf was cheating on her. Finally, the turning point in their relationship came. The LDR, constant fights and distrust became too hard to bear. They broke up and she naturally came falling into my arms.
I feel bad and actually guilty for doing such things thats why I'm writing this confession. My question to you guys is that if you were in my shoes, what would you do for love? what boundaries would you break and what morals would you shatter - to attain this entity we call love?
TLDR: Just because there is a goalkeeper, dosent mean you cannot score a goal. I hope this story inspires people out there whose crushes are attached, where I want you guys to know that nothing is impossible, just follow your dreams.

57515,101080,"I am a 176cm tall girl. It was really tough meeting sg guys whom are willing to accept someone of my height and I want to keep it this way to go for sg guys since I still want to keep myself real instead of faking myself with fake english and all. Eww. So recently, I fell in love with this guy I met online few months ago, we starting meeting up, do some dating & couple things together. He is really smart, good career, well built, and heads to yoga & gym along with me. But the height was an issue to him because he is a 168cm. He also told me that he belong to the smaller side. I told him it is fine, I will still treat him like a king, my own king. I understand from my sisters that girls need to constantly rub guy's ego, so I really tried everything to do that. But, last night on NY was a shocker to me. We did the deed and I am shocked that his thing is the size of my pinky finger!! Literally 3cm full erected & its not even thick at all. Although my pool of sg guys wasn't a lot, but from the data i gathered together with my sisters, sg guys have a max of up to 15cm or footlong. But hell.. why am I seeing this. So I want to ask the ladies here, what will you do if you face this? Should I break up with him given that I know I won't be satisfied with my sex life ever if I marry him one day?

58980,103870,"Some people would hate me for sharing this. I am a slim girl naturally well-endowed with huge boobs. For Chinese girls, those with skinny limbs, small hips and flat stomach usually have flat or small chests. To give you some perspective, it is a 36C. And I am only 162cm and 48kg.
I'll be honest... I do enjoy the attention. Sometimes, I wear push-ups and straighten my back to make my assets more obvious. Other times, I don't even wear a bra, and even though it doesn't look as big, the nips are visible. I am proud of it, and I like to low-key show off, though I never say it out loud. Sometimes, I even unbutton the top 2 buttons of my shirt or angle my posture such that people can get a sneak peek of my bare breasts through an opening in my shirt. I know this sounds really perverted and twisted af, but I think I might be an exhibitionist. I hope you don't judge me.
I know that many girls are jealous and many guys fantasize about me - and I have caught many staring, including teachers and dads of my friends. It gives me a devilish kind of happiness when I hear that my boobs are the talk of the town. I'm sorry if you feel like telling me off at this point. But this is me.
But recently, for the first time in 24 years, I felt sad after wondering if having huge boobs is the only thing that I will ever be known for. And I feel empty.
What happened was this: I just broke up with my ex-bf over text for personal reasons, and he was really upset. I understand why he was angry, but I could not have anticipated the stuffs that happened later. Out of spite, he revealed that the only thing he wanted in the relationship was to get access to my boobs and describe them to his guy friends. Nothing about my ""bitch character"" attracted him, it was only about the sex. He even told me that his guy friends had all seen my nudes that he took, and I was just a conquest for him to show off his exploits. Wtf right. What an asshole. To verify, I asked a mutual friend who was in that gang, and he admitted after me probing for some time that he showed them those private photos on his phone but never sent them electronically. I had never felt more offended and insulted in my life. I remember I was so angry that I was screaming my head off in my room and throwing and breaking things, and my sister almost wanted to tie me up. I let this douchebag take my virginity, use me to fulfil all his deviant fantasies and I had only ever given myself to him and nobody else in my entire freaking life! And he just bloody treated it like it meant nothing to him! I was so furious that I even entertained the idea of hooking up with his brother or his boss, who is a friend of mine, just to get back at him. I actually sent out a video message saying ""Hey, want to hook up I really want this"", but recalled it shortly after thank goodness for Telegram's recall function. Eventually, common sense got the better of me and I didn't end up doing anything rash. Now, I still feel angry enough to feel shortness of breath every time I think about this, but at least I am rational enough not to do something I'll regret.
Now that I am here, I want to ask. How do I filter out the guys who are only after my boobs? How can I give people the impression that I am more than just my body parts? I can't be wearing oversized tees all the time, and I love my girly wardrobe. Also, I am a young woman, and I still want to flaunt it a little and feel sexy. In a way, I do have to show off cos I sometimes get paid to advertise stuffs on my public IG and TikTok account. Is there a way to find a balance? If yes, how to achieve it?

But subsequently in the relationship, he did hint to split 50 50 and want me to take parts of my share. He send me home everytime initially , but after we get together, no more. He say in Singapore, 80% of the relationship goes on dutch and 15% is guys pay all and 5% others. It is true? I wasnt from Singapore and he was the first Singaporean bf I have. From my understanding, guy do pay for dates. But when in relationship, is it normally dutch? One meal alternatively? He wants equal contribution to our relationship. We had a fight over this and he gave in.
When we talk about family, he say he expect his wife to continue work after pregnancy because he think women will become shallow and obsolete if they don't. Is this a common beliefs among the Singaporean? I don't intend to be a housewife but taking out the option is another thing.
I know each relationship is unique and we are all dealing with different things. The objective is this post is just to understand the social norms Singaporean guys have. I am just confused that is my bf the norm or not.
My bf still treated me very well and love me a lot. He did pay for most of the date and I pay for some dates. He pay for the food, I pay for the drinks.

58292,102602,"My husband has a s** addiction issue. What should I do?
When we were dating I know his past gfs were all of a different nationality. I was his first gf of the same race as him. We were together for 6 years before getting married. All along I didn't notice anything amiss about him. We have a typical safe and secure relationship I guess. He makes me feel safe. He respects me. He is filial to his parents as well as mine. He is kind to people around him including the cleaners. He doesn't judge or say anything bad about others. He is smart. He has a good career path planned out and he knows what he wants to achieve in life and he involves me in all his plans. To me, he is perfect.
When I was pregnant with our first child, I discovered that he had been visiting prostitutes throughout my pregnancy. Not just any type of prostitutes. But a particular type. It was such a rude shock to me and I almost delivered my baby early. I cried a lot before and during the initial months after the birth of our child and I fought with him a lot. He confessed to me he has an addiction. He thought he had gotten over it after we are together but the urge came when I was pregnant and he couldn't control himself. We went for therapy and he also attended therapy for his fetish. I chose to forgive him and start over.
More than 5 years later, I thought we have put this behind us. But recently he confessed to me he reoffended again not once but several times recently. He couldn't bear the guilt of hiding it from me so he told me. He beg me to go with him for counselling again. He didn't want to lose me.
I am so heartbroken and I feel so lost right now. I thought of separation because I feel I am going mad just having him in the same house. At the same time I feel and wonder how can I help and support him. I love and hate him so much now. I feel so lost. If you're an addict, will you ever get over it? Is there hope for us? I don't think I can go through this again.
We only have 1 child. I chose to not have more in case he hurt me again and he did. I have my own career so I do not feel stuck in the marriage. What can I do?

59916,105731,"I'm 25 years old this year, and I don't have a boyfriend yet. The reason is because I'm fat.
Growing up, I've always been on the larger side as compared to the rest of my friends. I'm currently 160cm and 65kg. Like all plus sized individuals, I've been continuously teased and made fun of throughout my life because of my weight. From primary school, to secondary school, to JC, and even now, in the working world, I endure backhanded comments like ""You would look so much prettier if you slimmed down."" and much more.
I know that fat people are essentially disliked and looked down upon, if I can use that phrase. We don't get attention from people other than when it's to ridicule us. Some people make friends with us out of pity. But it's not like I haven't made an effort to slim down. I've tried everything: going on a diet, exercising daily (which I still do), eating medicine, fasting et cetera., but even if they worked, the results are not amazing. I will admit I've lost weight from some of these methods, but not enough for me to become attractive to the male gaze.
One thing I want to know is, is personality not enough for guys? I know that I'm not ""ugly"". I take care of my skin well, I think I have a pretty average face (if you excuse the weight), the only problem with me is that I'm fat. I also agree that I would look better if I slimmed down, who doesn't? But why do some guys overlook me as a whole and only focus on appearance?
Personally, my type of guy is not a lot to ask for. I just want a nice guy that's kind to me and treats me well. Disclaimer, I know, of course, aesthetics play a part, and even though I don't mind dating a fat guy, I know plenty of girls who would mind. But since my experience is with guys and not girls, this is what I'm focusing on.
I've went on a few dates through dating apps. Each and every time after the date, the guy would tell me something along the lines of ""I think you're very fun to be around, but I don't think we're suitable for each other."" and if I press further, it would usually end with them saying ""My ideal type is someone slimmer."" Dashing my hopes is a normal experience for me on dates now. Honestly, I'm not sure why they would agree to a date if they know I'm not their ""type"". Maybe to ridicule me? I'm used to it anyway.
Anyway, back to the problem and my question, do guys really think that appearance triumphs personality every single time? Even if a woman is a complete and utter asshole, but is beautiful, are guys willing to enter into a relationship with them? And is that the reason why I've not been successful in getting a partner even now? If so, even if I manage to slim down, I wouldn't be loved for who I am, but rather what I look like. Then how would the relationship ever work?
Please offer me your guidance and answers everybody, I'm truly in desperate need of this.
P.S. Maybe some people will ask me to stay single, girls can be independent too right? Yes, but I do also really want to find a partner to stay with when I grow older. It's not my wish to be single forever, although others may feel differently.

58970,103850,"Have been with my bf for 2.5 years, met through Tinder. Both of us were in uni when we first met and joined the workforce 1.5 year ago. He got promoted to a senior role and started getting really busy with work over the last 5 months. Our meetups were often shortened to just 2-3 hrs a week for a quick meal and catchup, to give him enough time for rest and to spend with his family over the weekends. We missed out celebrating for valentines day, mother's day and my dad's birthday during that entire period due to his busy schedule. My bf has always said sorry for not spending enough time with me multiple times every week and made promises to meet up with me more often.
His project has just ended and I was looking forward to meeting him more as his workload would hve reduced significantly. However, instead of making time out for me, he went ahead to fill his schedule for this entire week with meeting his friends for dinner and drinks, leaving the same 3 hr timeslot for me on a saturday afternoon.
I asked if he will be free next week but he say he will be starting on another project next week and will be back having overtime and a really busy schedule so he is unable to make time out to meet me. Yesterday, I saw a notification from his female friend saying 17 June would be a better date for dinner and out of curiosity, i opened the message. I realised he asked her for a catchup next week as he is free the entire week and gave all the evenings as available options to cater to her schedule. He also offered to send her home after the meal since it would be late (around 9-10+pm) and he wanted to watch out for her safety.
I confronted him about it but he turned it into an issue of me looking into his messages without his consent, which I then apologised. He mentioned that it is an old friend and he havent met her in 6 months hence he wanted to set aside some time to meet her. Sending her home would be a given as he has a car and he wouldn't have to make much of a detour to return back home after that. I tried asking why he seemed very available to meet her and his other friends but not me, and all he ever did was to make it as if I am the one demanding too much from him. He said that he had discussed about his hectic work schedule with me early on in our relationship and he expected me to be more understanding and allow him to meet his friends during his free time.
Am I really asking too much from him? I feel very lonely in the relationship and I'm thinking of leaving if this goes on.

58851,103627,"My fiance has lost money on TerraLuna.
We have been saving up since secondary school. We have plans to BTO, raise beautiful kids and go on dream vacations. All these have come to a naught within a span of just a few days.
The idea of investing in cryptocurrency was first introduced to him by his circle of close friends. He was made to believe that he can make a quick buck and retire early. He took his friends words for it and dabbled into crypto trading.
There were occasions where he would boast to me that he had made a killing which would enable us to realize our dream quicker. Given the volatility of such investment, he assured me that he is well aware of the risk and persuaded me to join as well. Considering that his decision meant well for both of us, I decided to follow suit and entrust my life savings to him in hope that he will not disappoint me.
I should have known better not to do it when he began distancing himself from me and stayed silent on Whatsapp over the past few weeks. Being a concerned partner, I reached out to him to find out how he is doing and to check on our investment. When the topic of investment is raised, he would flare up for no reason and would shout at me over the phone.
A few days ago, a crypto-coin known as TerraLuna (or whatever they call it) made headlines for losing all of its value with allegations made against the founder for fraud.
Worried that it would impact our investment, I phoned my fiance but failed to reach him. I tried to dial his friend only to find out that he had put all his money in this so-called coin only to lose everything. Upon hearing the news, my heart sunk knowing that our hard-earned money were gone and our dreams destroyed. The last I heard about him was from his friend who told me that he had to resort to borrowing from loan sharks in hope to recover his losses only to end up losing more.
We have plans to hold our wedding in Dec which was made known to everyone early this year. Now we have to call it off because of his silly mistake. I can no longer see a future with him and I certainly do not see myself helping with his debt. Heck, I am even contemplating doing OnlyFans to re-build my wealth.
I am v lost as to what to do and how to break the news to everyone about our wedding dismissal should they question about it due to this incident.

1. He only has 1 relationship which he broke off in his first year of uni due to incompatibility and never dated thereafter. Basically he never dated anyone for more than 10 years. He didn’t explain this long gap.
2. He said he is a virgin. I find it hard to believe given his age and he is not religious. Btw I’m not a virgin myself.
3. He doesn’t have any form of social media on IG or tiktok. He only has facebook. He showed it to me and he has only 15 friends inside and his last post was like in 2016? I tried very hard to search myself and asked my connections but can’t find anything on him.
Are these red flags or just small issues? I find that he is a bit too good to be true and yet I kept thinking about his past record.

58261,102570,"Recently I had a big argument with my wife because I suggested to her that she should just quit her job and stay at home to take care of our son. My mum is helping to take care now, but I always thought it will be best for a parent to stay at home and take care of the house, so that there will be someone to properly supervise the child and ensure proper upbringing, especially if we have another child next time. She argued that I do not respect her goals and social life and said I am going back on my promises. Yes, she previously did say that she intends to continue to work after having kids. I didn’t disagree back then, neither did I agree too, so there wasn’t any promises made? And I didn’t think she will take it seriously cos I thought alot of women will be open to the idea of staying at home to bond with the child after having one. Her portion of income isn’t really essential too as she really isn’t earning much and I am confident that my salary is enough to support all of us decently. Plus, who will prefer to go out and work and face stresses from bosses, deadlines, office politics etc, over staying at home?? All she needs to do is take care of our son and do a bit of chores during the day and I’ll help her after work. She also complains that I am already not helping out a lot now. I am already trying my best but she doesn’t understand that I have a hectic work schedule that there is just so much time and energy I have to help.
Now she is threatening not to have another child, but prior to marriage we already agreed to have 2 kids to complete the family. I don’t know what I can do to appease her.

59133,104206,"I'm not sure where or who to turn to. I'm in my early 30s and I'm dating a really young girl and shes still in uni, early 20s. Im earning around 5k-ish and whenever we go out, I'll always pay for her. We hardly visit kopitiams and its always like cafes or restaurants. We didnt really have any official title but she got mad when she see that i still have dating apps in my phone and when my previous fwb sent me nudes.
We started off hooking up but slowly we met up more frequently cause i guess we enjoyed each other's company? It became close to 5 or 6 months now and i have never been so ready and decisive when it comes to a relationship/girl.
Some context, before me she was hooking up and had sugar daddies. When i wanted exclusivity or i thought we were, we had a conversation and she confessed that earlier on she went to meet her ex fwb for a last f**k cause she liked him and thought that he would come back for her; nope. Then shortly later she popped the question to me to ask if i was okay with her having a sugar daddy and it was all for money. I asked her, did i ever say no when you want to go places? Nope. You want i can buy you branded bags and stuff every quarterly. She say she didnt want my money.
Fast forward now, she is still in contact with that sugar daddy who pays her close to my amount. Despite not feeling remorse of what she did to me, she even had the cheek to ask me to allow her to continue and she will love me wholeheartedly when she cheated behind my back with 2 different guys.
She told me, ""its just s** what. Plus its protected. I wont love that guy and i will never be tgt with him.""
Im conflicted, i know its easy money, am i not open minded enough? Is it me thats obstructing this relationship here. Throughout the recent convo we had, she didnt mention anything about my feelings, it was guy A, guy B etc what about him, how poor thing he is etc. What about me? Am i not a human at all? Do i not have feelings?
So much when i say okay meet him lesser times and when that guy gave up he wanted to give in to us. She was upset and made it seem like its my fault. ""See la, money gone like that""
What am i suppose to do? I am really at wits end. I really love her alot. So much so i told her lets start afresh. I will close two eyes and forget what youve done.
I am the kind of guy that will help her tie her laces whenever it was loose, i am the guy that looked after her when she felt giddy and couldnt walk, i am the guy that will massage for her when she complains neck or back pain, i am the guy that would rather inconvenient myself or sleep lesser hours, just so i could make things convenient for her. I am the guy that is foolishly in love with this girl.

57927,101837,"Hi everyone I would like to check how couple split the cost for their
1. Housing
2. Renovation
3. Wedding
4. Bills, groceries, wants and needs?
I'm my case, I have just gotten a resale flat and my bf paid about $6000 for OTP and miscellaneous cost and he asked to split the cost. This actually caught me by surprise because on my case, I would think that the ""milestone"" of getting a house should be paid by Man as it would reflect his sincerity in getting a flat together with a girl. Is this not right? This is actually a sincere question asking for advice, please do not bash me.
My friends told me they expected the wedding to be fully paid by the Man as it is the Man job to give a woman the dream wedding. Is that right ?
Do people split the cost by having a joint account or how do we determine who pay for what ?

58855,103637,"Honestly, I made a pact with myself to no longer date women who don't work out on a regular basis (and a 'regular basis' for me is about 3-4 times a week for at least an hour). It has to be a part of her routine, like she doesn't feel right when she doesn't go to the gym or workout at home; it has to be a part of her lifestyle. Not necessarily 0% body fat as I'm not into super tight muscular women, but she has to look good and shapely, with or without clothing. She also needs to eat at least moderately healthy, and not a heavy drinker/non-smoker . So many women out here refuse to take care of themselves and expect men to just accept and deal with it especially because of this whole body positivity movement, and I'm not with it. Even if it means only dating 1 girl a year, quality over quantity.

57565,101172,"I’m 42F and a couple of months ago I went for profiling session via zoom from a dating agency my friend recommended.
The lady from that dating agency said it’s near impossible to match me to men around my age. She said she has a client in his 50s with chronic diseases, and she can match me to him. She even asked me if I mind taking care of him as he has chronic diseases.
For a moment, I wondered it’s a dating agency or a maid/nurse hiring agency.
Anyway, it is true men in 40s won’t choose women around their age?
