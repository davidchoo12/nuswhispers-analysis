Me: Does a toilet cleaner have to care if the owner has passed motion that day?
Interviewer: No. Whether the owner has passed motion that day is his own problem. The toilet cleaner's job is to ensure that the toilet paper is enough. If there is not enough toilet paper, the toilet cleaner just had to add me.
Me: Same logic. Why I left the previous job is between and my previous company. My job is to go for more interview until one company has finally decided to hire me. If in the unfortunate circumstance that I don't get hired by this company, I just have to go for more job interview.

60141,106164,"Dating, especially first dates are so hard nowadays. Everyone is bringing their own set of beliefs, ideas, expectations and checklists to the dating table instead of just chilling, vibing and enjoying the other individual's company.
Like the last girl I went on a first date with. All she could talk about is money, ambitions and what a guy is to do for her. I gave her time to warm up thinking she might be anxious but in vain. I just couldn't vibe with her even though she was very attractive. An indifferent attitude about not wanting to really know about the other individual and couldn't take it easy. It was a bloody turn off. I had to leave. I reckon beauty is getting so common nowadays that it didn't matter when the vibe is not right.
What happen to having fun and going with the flow during dates?

60148,106181,"Ranting and looking for advice. Topic: Friends.
I used to have a clique of friends in sec school. We slowly seperated due to our different stages in life, but it seems that only me and a two other guys were the one left out. I felt very upset about it as we were quite a tight knit gang previously but as we slowly grow up and went different schools we all drifted apart.
Now I no longer have a group of friends or even my best friend to meet up with anymore.
My best friend is also part of the clique, she still is now. We stopped catching up on each other, and now we dont even talk anymore. I kind of put most of the blame on her as I felt she wasn't reciprocating the same energy I was giving. Back then, I would bake cake on her birthday, get her presents and stuff but she doesn't. Sometimes she forgot about my birthday as well. But seeing her surrounded by friends and all, I am wondering is it just me? What is wrong with me that I can't manage to keep my friends? Why is it that she doesn't do the same for me that she manages to keep her friends but not me? I just want a group or a few people to hang out and chat with. ????

I find my life pretty good on its own. My pay is average but is very meaningful. I have high goals which are not monetary-based but more on the impact I can create on people's lives.
I have a couple of hobbies like learning spanish, fishing, etc.
I do have great friends and we hang out frequently despite graduating a while back.
I think I am generally a good person but not perfect, I mean no one is lol. I do try to work on myself.
However, all of these are useless in dating. No one cares if I knew Spanish or if I caught massive fishes before. I think it doesnt matter if I am good person sometimes. Lol, I saw one of the holiest girl get together with the well known (but good looking) cheater friend. Honestly, I dont even know what they care sometimes.
I am not your traditional hunk but I am fit (running, badminton, basketball, etc). I am not exactly handsome but I do my best to dress well.
I dont exactly know what else to do. I have watched dumb youtube videos on flirting or playing the ""game"". Nothing seems to be working. Worst of all, I dont even feel like I am myself.
I tried being myself and being authentic but it gets me nowhere either. It is like a lot of girls dont even consider me as a possible partner.
The worst advice was to wait passively to meet the right one. It was the worst advice because it was just absolutely stagnant. At least, while trying, I was at least getting to meet girls.
Already tried online dating, joining interest groups, social event... Same results. I am not in their considerations as a partner.
Do I need to be rich and/or handsome? It is like nothing makes sense to me anymore.
Any advice on what to do?

My room is near the kitchen. And beside it is a corridor. Any footsteps I'll know. Any lights that are turned on in the kitchen I'll know. I can't close my door cos you said so. You will ask why I close my door. So I don't close my door.
My sis room's light shines in the direction that I sleep. And though she can close her door, she just leaves a gap there and that thin ray of light is still visible. And I still can't close my door. Granted I have a mini curtain at the entrance of my door but still it doesn't keep the lights out.
And the neighbours. We have neighbours randomly shouting vulgarities at no one occasionally in the middle of the night. Making noise at the void deck. And some gaming action with low base boom boom being audible even with their windows shut. Plus I have growing insomnia ever since uni.
I can't wear ear plugs without risking not hearing my own phone alarm. So I still can hear random sounds all around.

I'm in my 30s and I recently got married to my lovely wife and we are moving to our new nest. Like most parents who dote on their kids my parents are no different and people and have doted on me ever since young buying me almost anything I would ask for, clothes, shoes, bags, books, toys, CDs/DVDs, etc. You name it, I've probably bought it. Moving out was a real pain as I realised I have accumulated so much stuff of the years! These are accompanied by the textbooks, notes, cards, and year books.
These are compounded by need for 'just in case' scenarios. Honestly, if you haven't used the item of a yr or so. You probably can do away with it. You don't need it, throw it out.
Spending the week going through these items and slowly throwing them away 1 by 1 really made me realise how unnecessary these material wants are. If only I had the wisdom not to splurge back then, I would be able to comfortably downpay a 2nd hand car.
To all my friends out there, live simply, live with less things and space. Be stingy with what you purchase. Spend it on good food that gives you a healthy diet and experiences that enhance you personally. At the end of the day, all these material wants are just clutter and regardless how well you keep them, they all start to age and deteriorate slowly. Have less. And spend the money on things that matter like a house, a car, on your parents/kids/loved ones, spend it on a good holiday, spend it on self improvement.

It is really scamming people frequently these days and I'm very annoyed. In their games you can win product vouchers. I got one, and immediately after that the seller removed the product from their shop, now I'm left with a voucher of no use. I spoke to the seller and they said it's sold out, they don't know when it's coming back and since the voucher is from Shopee they said ask Shopee. As of today it has been several weeks. Within these weeks I have approached Shopee multiple times with alternatives like how about another similar product? I don't mind another equivalent, doesn't have to be that one. They said no, the voucher is only for this product that NO LONGER EXISTS. What a joke. Also this is the third time that this has happened. Any of you experienced the same? Am I the a**hole for being angry?
How many of you won't be mad at this? Gamers out there imagine this - you invest time/money on your games right? Imagine you press upgrade or you won a boss, but at the end of it you see no change to your level, inventory or xp. Then when you ask customer service they tell you that they can't do anything even though it's their game. You can only wait till they feel like it.
Also auntys and uncles you buy Toto 4D right? Imagine you win, then the counter says oh we ran out of prize money so you wait, when we have money we let you know again. And the timeline for when you'll get your prize is unknown. How many of you would be chill about that? Seriously?

When I was playing a mmorpg game, my bf asked me ""who are you playing with, what are their names, male or female"".

I also noticed he joined the game's facebook private group that i was in, even though he doesn't play the game.
Some other incidents that also shooked me: 1) Asked me who's this guy that frequently likes my facebook posts, insisted that the guy wants my attention. 2) Said my ig numbers increased, asked who followed me and who i followed. He said he's not stalking, just sensitive to numbers. I screenshot my ""most recent follows"" to show him it's a glitch, but he was still doubtful. 3) From time to time ask me ""any guys message or talk to you on Facebook recently?"". 4) Whenever we have an argument he'll spam call and msg until i have no choice but to answer the call even though i dont wanna.

60143,106165,"It is heartbreaking to see everyone around me having the very thing (unicorn) I want but can never have. Honestly, it is depressing.
I was born different from my friends. I grew being the odd one out. I let people push me around just to be part of the group. They constantly looked down on me. People do not openly say things as they get mature and get older but sometimes, they do or say something that brings me back to reality that I am different. I have always felt like an outsider.
When I finally met some people who were like me, I couldn't connect with them. I was too different from what they expected me to be. I was an outsider even with people like me now.
In the end, I ended up naturally steering towards the same kind of people I grew up instead.
I put in more effort to fit into the group. They did things that were difficult for me to do because I wasn't taught by my parents. I struggled but I learned and did my best. Sometimes, I did these things better than my friends which was ironic. It still didn't matter because at the end of the day, I was still looked down upon. Worst of all, when it was their turn to learn something about my difference, they put no effort and dont even care. I have known some of my friends for more than a decade now and they still dont know the basics.
People tell me that I should own my difference and be proud of it but honestly, I cant. I really tried, like really. I spent years trying to convince myself but in the end, people always remind me that I am different. It has caused me nothing but hurt and pain so far. I am sorry but it is hard to try to own and be proud about my difference when I have 4 other guys sitting around me and literally insulting me because of it.
The final breaking point came when I realised that I cannot have this special thing (lets call it unicorn) that all of my friends get in the later part of their life. It is not as though I did not work hard. I worked harder than anyone else in the room. Guess what? It didnt matter. It is heartbreaking to see them get it so easily when despite some of them putting no effort at all.
The worst part is that I get scolded for wanting the unicorn too. It is not fair to me. I grew up just like everyone else. I put in more effort them everyone else.
Why is it wrong for me to want the same thing that everyone else have?
They dont face the same problem that I face. They dont have to make the choice (unicorn) that I have to make. They just have it.
It is so unfair.
I know this post feels very negative. Despite all the problems, I have tried to keep a positive mindset, hoping that one day things will turn in my favour.
I went all out chasing the unicorn (like ridiculous amounts of effort), only to realise that I am not deemed worthy by the unicorn and will never be. I was brought back to reality and I am still quite shaken by it.

I've approached Company A first to ask for an internship opportunity but shortly received another offer few hours later from Company B.
Here are some profiling:
Company A
- A subsidiary of a publicly listed company in the industry
- Potential opportunity for growth (to jump into or be recognised by the mother company)
- Response for internship opportunity was not firm. I was told to just email them and they'll 'see what they can do'
Company B
- A government agency
- (commonly seen as a superior party by the older generations I suppose)
- Firm and keen response from the employer; sounds almost guaranteed that I'll get the internship
Both of the job scope seem to be something I'd enjoy in, so assuming the pay and location of the workplace are the same,
1) Which company should I go for?
2) How do I politely reject the other, while still maintaining the relationship for future opportunities?
Especially since I'm the one who approached Company A myself, what should I do if I decide to go with Company B?
Thanks and have a great December!
