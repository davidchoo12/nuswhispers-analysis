60914,107824,"I hang out with this group of guys. One of them like to make demeaning comments about women in general. He kept saying he pity women with small chests as they look like 12 and how much they turn him off. I don't like hearing it but I always ignore him. Once I got very pissed off when he tried to ask us about our gfs' body. He was trying to guess which one of our gf has the biggest chest and he was trying to trick us to tell him.
I almost lost my cool but the others managed to calm the situation. 
My gf is a cup E, even a simple tshirt will look provocative on her. I've been very protective of her and had been keeping her away from that particular friend because I really don't like how he talks about women in general. 
Recently that annoying friend got himself a gf. All that talk about women's chests, he is now dating a woman with no chest. He no longer yak about womens' body. 
Suddenly I feel life is fair.

I was driving back home at sengkang and I was listening to my song and enjoying my music with my windows wind down. I was stopped at the junction.
Then I noticed this cute bespectacled girl staring at me from the car beside?? I thought she was pretty cute so I smiled and I gave her two mini heart shape formed with my index and middle finger.
She gave a huge and smiled but then the green arrow appeared for her grabcar (SN*1909* I can't rmb!) and made a right turn and I caught her looking back. 
That was my sign that I think I had a chance and I couldn't react in time to leave any info to have a chance to connect. 
I did a u turn Infront at the next junction and wanted to see her again but I saw her grabcar turning out from the condominium ""THE QUARTZ"". But she wasn't in the car anymore!
Then was when I realised I have missed my chance. 
If you have any friends that stay in THE QUARTZ condominium and sat in the car 1909 at around 230am on 20 Aug please spread the word!! I want to know her more!!

60917,107832,"Wondering do fresh grad really earns that much nowadays? Saw post mentioning that they just graduated and earn a mediocre salary of high 4k + to 5k. Is the median pay really ~4.5k for fresh grad? 
When I just started working, my salary was a low 3k. After working in the audit industry for 2 years, my salary is currently still lower than those fresh graduates despite working for long hours. Am I getting low balled or it’s just unfortunate that I’m in the wrong industry.

TLDR: What key element promotes a healthy, happy & longevity marriage?
When we were younger, perhaps in our teens age, we often fell in love with nontangible substances and often by impulse. It could be lust or physical attribute but rarely anything material since we have yet to experience adulthood and realise the importance/impact of financial literacy/ stability.
As we get older, maybe when we get into our first higher education or begin our first part time/full-time job, we pay more notice to tangible items and maybe get hooked up to the idea that our romantic partner has to acquire/ achieve a certain level of financial status & physical attributes to match our checklist of what our future potential spouse should be.
But wealth can vanish overnight, and physical attributes dissipate over time. And when this superficial stuff is gone, which is what you value at the start of the relationship, then will you still choose to be with that person? Or would you stick to it but regret it every day in your life? Or would you walk out of it? 
That aside, if we throw all these ideas away and imagine if we are stranded on an island where only survival matters and none of these tangible stuff matters, then what would you value? Would it still be the physical attributes of an individual, how much their bank carries, or what other layers beneath the surface of all these superficial stuff will you look at?
Many people say a romantic relationship and marriage are two very different things. In a relationship, people may value surface stuff usually based on first impressions that is the tangible items mentioned above. In a marriage, beyond the tangible stuff, they look into the compatibility of lifestyle, not two individuals but two families, as we are shaped by our environment/ upbringing of our family. 
Then 10/20 years down the road of a marriage, the idea of the very initial phase of butterflies in the stomach becomes so strange and unfamiliar to us that we forget how that even felt like. Many old couples said such a relationship is mundane and boring, similar to how you start your day by reading a newspaper, sipping your coffee and carrying on your day with your work. There is no excitement. But some say it makes them very fulfilled, while some lament why they even chose to start this journey.
So my question to you is: what do you value in a relationship? What do you want from a relationship? Why do you want a relationship? And what do you think is the key element to a healthy, happy and longevity relationship?

60912,107819,"Dear Prof Ben,
I have a deferred offer to Stanford MSCS, deferred because my mom just got cancer. I was NUS quantitative finance. My hope is to get into either finance jobs or FinTech jobs but the ultimately dream is to have my own startup. I also wouldn't mind spending a few years working in Silicon Valley I'm keeping my options open. My mom wants me to go but I opted to stay with her until she gets better. She is early stage and curable, doctor says she'll be okay. My dad will be paying for all expenses for my masters. Our family is well-to-do but I really don't want to be wasting time on the degree if it is not useful. What do you think?

60918,107833,"Reading the post from my EE senior #107766, I wonder is there a good future for engineering in SG?
I don't mean software engineering as that is hardly engineering at all. I refer to core engineering branches like electrical, civil, mechanical and chemical.
These core engineering majors have been a dumping ground for years and I admit I'm one of those which is why I ended up in EE. Call it acquired taste but I grew to like this field. I'm not keen in software or finance careers that many of my engineering seniors have gone to.
I'm in my final year and planning my career options. I read from surveys that the starting pay for engineers is very low in SG and it sorts of dooms your entire career as I understand every pay is built on what you earned previously. I hope leaving the engineering field we trained and suffered so hard in school for is not the only way for engineers to get a good pay.
Short of heading overseas, what good career options are there in engineering that still pays reasonably close to software or finance?
