61226,108632,"Does anyone have parents like mine?
I just started working, salary 4k before cpf. Not living with them since 2 years back.
I wanted to give allowance, so I told my mom I would like to give her 10%, thinking that she will be happy you know, that I still thought of her. But then she was like, not happy, and said ""only ah""... which is kind of a downer tbh
then after that she started to send me online discussion threads on allowance, those people commented that they give 20% or more. She also likes to send those quotes that say ""Mom suffers the most and are the best"" ""There is no price tag on mom's love"", ""Mom worked so hard to put me through school, I will give my whole salary to make her happy"" something along those lines. 
She always sends them and say just sending for me to see, nothing much. Then whenever I reply, like to say dad also contributed or I did give you 10%, she will get upset and say she didn't ask for my replies. JUST READ DONT REPLY.
for context I have not taken a single cent of allowance since jc, even from part time jobs I earned through sch, also have been giving her allowance here and there. Uni was totally self funded.
She also says that she gave her own parents way more than 10% during her time, but bro that was when hdb and food were cheap... 
She always say she is very reasonable and very ok with stuff, but whenever money brought up she will mention 10% too little I very stingy, this auntie that auntie child give 25% etcetc. Can eat out and buy stuff but cannot give her the money. She is the perfect child and most filial, but I'm the stingy one. Always say she is just saying,  but she kept bringing it up and sending me those hints.
Am I gaslighted or 10% really too little?? Right now I'm giving 10% each, total 20% already, I feel quite reasonable tbh. I also have my life to build man. And I earn money, ofc I will save but can't I also spend some for my enjoyment?? What's the point of hogging money to the grave?

61230,108661,"I've seen numerous articles on allowance to parents. This time, it landed on me. My apologies on the long story ahead. I needed to get it off my chest for my sanity...
My mother keeps comparing me to her friends children. “People earn how much also give their mother 40-50%” She goes around sharing with her friends that I’m only giving her so little allowance as compared to her friends children and that I should be giving her more. When I first graduated, she asked about my pay. I'm unwillingly to disclose much because of her behavior. She will calculate market rate, % and her friends children. She even asked, so when will you get promoted? (So that they will increase your pay). 
Fast forward, 2 years + later, I left my job. The intensity adds on. This was what hurts me enough that it was almost the last straw. She insisted that I continue to give her monthly allowance even though I'm jobless. She quoted: ""It's a principle thing"" + ""Where got you take up a loan, you can skip paying for x months?"" Someone suggested to return her the monthly allowances in instalments after I found a new job. FYI, I don't owe her any $$$. But this don't makes any sense to me no matter how hard I try to rationalize. Also, she’s a housewife, my father gives her more than enough. 
In my own opinion and capability. I’m giving out the amount I feel I can handle after taking into considerations of the future expenses (House, Renovation, Furnitures, Kids, Needs & Wants) etc. The only thing is I still live with her. Her house, her rules but not till this extent. I am self sustainable in terms of my needs & wants since I was 17. I don't get any allowances when I went to poly and uni while my siblings did. I did not ask for much. Then she began to add on “So fast think of house already?” I mean you don’t have to be at a certain age to think of the future expenses. What more, Singapore. Reality. 
Folks be like it’s your mother, she went through hardships to give birth to you etc. This shouldn’t be normalized. I deserved to be respected and treated as a human not a ….. :) Sigh, I’m tired really. I’m not giving her anything more than I can handle. I’m not giving in anymore. What's supposed to feel like a safe haven to me, no longer is.

61228,108654,"I refer to the post #108648. I thank that guy for introducing the statistics from ministry of manpower on salaries. At least now I got something to refer to. I am from electrical engineering and the median for my industry is about 5207 (including employer CPF) which is very close to the 5197(including employer CPF) median of the overall gross monthly income. If I ask for 4.5K(excluding employer CPF) as my starting pay, does anyone think the companies will be willing to pay me median salary for a start? I have a degree in EE, Is it too much? (5.2K is including employer CPF, $4444 is excluding employer CPF so I round off to $4.5K) I think that as a degree holder fresh grad, I should ask for at least around median salary.

61229,108658,"Hi all, I'm a Business Analytics graduate from School of Computing. I have been in the workforce for a few years, and recently I was wondering if I should pause and take a full-time Masters in Computer Science. I'm interested to do a research masters (instead of coursework). However, I'm hoping to finance this masters through the NUS Research Scholarship. I was wondering how competitive is the scholarship award for Masters Research in Computer Science, specifically AI track? I had good grades when I did my Bachelors, but withdrew from my FYP previously because it was open-ended and the idea that I proposed didn't suit me and the Prof at the time. I was hoping to join an existing research project and learn from it instead. What are my chances of getting the research scholarship?
