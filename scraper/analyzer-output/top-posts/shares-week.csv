60934,107857,"Anything I need to know before marrying a Malaysian?
She is from JB and went to RGS when she was 13. Before that she went to several international schools all over the ASEAN region. NUS Med. I’m NUS Med too. Accent is indistinguishable from any Singaporean I know. Maybe a bit too atas but I don’t know if it’s because of RGS or because she’s from a really rich family in JB. Also my father is a taxi driver so I’m not exactly in her class. 
Her father owns 80% of a listco in Malaysia. Yet, very humble (almost cheap) family. Her father drives a 20-year-old Camry and refuses to buy a new car before his current one breaks. He does go all out in certain things, particularly education of his children and real estate. She has a paid-off 3-room condo to her name in Holland Village that her father bought for her. My girlfriend is also cheap. She thinks traveling for leisure is a waste of money, thinks Starbucks is a waste of money etc. Every time I meet her she would find a way to say something is a waste of money. I don’t mind this I’m poor anyway, but I would like to elevate my standard of living and I would like to travel for leisure one day.
My impression is Singaporeans have no conflict with Malaysians because we’re essentially the same culture but I also know this girl and her family enough to say that they are nothing like ordinary Malaysians. They speak only English at home, no religion, and they believe strongly in independence of women. Her father has spoken to me about marriage and he wants me to know that for banquet and wedding expenses, I don’t have to worry because what can be halved will be halved and for banquet he will pay for his own guests and only his own guests.  
My family on the other hand is conservative and my mom is very “Chinese.” Still places importance in Chinese culture and wants grandchildren very much. My girlfriend’s family has pretty much abandoned their Chinese culture (they don’t celebrate CNY for example). She also has no plans to have children early or at all.
The children issue is perhaps the main source of friction but I am lukewarm about having kids as well so I think I’d be able to ignore my mom. Other than that, my trepidation is in the disparity of socioeconomic class, which I am not socialized well enough to understand the issues that it could bring.
Trying to get some last thoughts. Greatly appreciated.

We initially didn’t do it cuz we were very worried that I’ll get pregnant if the condom breaks/pill doesn’t work what not. So my bf said the best way is just not doing it at all. 
Before you guys start, I do believe my bf is physically attracted to me, we’ve done some physical stuff but just didn’t reach like the smashing prt yet that’s all. He’s also very physically affectionate with me, would always hug/kiss me that kind of thing.
I’ve been trying to convince him to at least do it once or twice. Now with modern inventions I believe we can be very careful but he just won’t budge.
I feel very morally dispirited and it has caused me to question if maybe I’m just not what he wants in a partner. I’m not looking to find another guy to smash or that kind of thing, but could anyone please give me some advice for this?
Thanks in advance.

60937,107902,"I want to talk about rating people. We all rate people we choose. We rate them in terms of wealth, personality (we can vibe and is a good person) and appearance. 
I had a friend who had a crush on handsome and smart guy. The problem was that my friend was not pretty. However, she had a good personality, good sense of humour and was a kind person (does volunteering on weekends). Now, when she told our friend group, she had an immense backlash and everyone criticised that she is nowhere close to his level. Our friend group started to give ratings and she was rated 5 while the guy was rated a 9. This was a pure rating on appearance alone. 
Her crush being popular cycled through a bunch of girls who were quite pretty, a minimum of 8 solely based on appearance. However, I heard that there were clashes with the girls and finally, he found the girl that he clicked well with who was rated 9 on appearance as well as a 8 on personality. We knew this girl.
Sorry, this isn't a story about my friend getting her crush. This is real life and not a k-drama.
Since my friend was only 5, most of the guys who accepted her were also around 4-6 in terms of appearance. She cycled through them until she married guy who was 6 in terms of appearance and a 7 in terms of personality. 
My other friend who was around a 7 in terms of appearance got a guy who was a 5 in terms of appearance but was a 8 in terms of wealth and a 6 in terms of personality.
As much as I want to deny the idea of rating people and attaching numbers to a person solely based on the mentioned aspects, the reality is grimmer than that. I am sure people are going to come out and say that personality is more important than looks or wealth or any extrinsic values. The truth cannot be further than that. 
Let me explain.
If you are a 8 in terms of appearance, you will have a lot of guys showing interest in you. You probably will pick the best and you might not lower your standard so you probably pick a minimum of maybe 6 in terms of appearance and maybe makes up for it in terms of personality or wealth. You probably won't bother with anyone below that because you have enough options. You will cycle through your options until you maximise a high combined number for appearance, wealth and personality.
If you are a girl with an appearance of say 5. You will not get much options and similarly, you will cycle through your options to maximise your chances.
The irony is that the girl who an appearance rating of 8 but personality score of 6 might get a guy who has an appearance rating of 8 and personality rating of 8. However, the girl with an appearance rating of 5 and personality rating of 9 will never get a chance at the same guy. 
The only exception to this is if the guy interacts with the girl LONG ENOUGH and sees beyond the physical aspect. Most of whatever I said so far mainly ties with basic interactions (like meeting at an event) or dating apps where you might not know much about the person but you have to decide whether to pursue them or not. 
Basically, I am saying that the first filter is appearance/wealth and if you don't meet that rating for the guy or girl you like, you won't even be in their option list. Personality comes as an afterthought and ironically, takes more time for the person to appreciate. As mentioned, unless the person spends enough time with you to appreciate your personality, you will never be in their option list if you are poor (as a guy) or are ugly (both genders). In essence, pretty girls land with rich or/and handsome guys and vice-versa. 
Am I wrong? I am basing this from what I see happening around me. I wish I was wrong.

60946,107883,"Recently, I realised my manager likes to get others to buy lunch and pay for her first but never ever takes the initiative to return the money for her own meal. To be honest, it really seems like she deliberately does not want to return the money and not because it slipped her mind. Once, someone on the table initiated and asked the person who paid for her meal first how much she owed her and immediately did the transfer. She was just seated next to this person and looking at her as she asked that so there was no way she missed the conversation. Yet, she did not take the initiative to ask how much she owed for her meal. It’s honestly quite hilarious how she’s trying to get free meals out of colleagues who are earning way lesser than her (as we are all mostly fresh graduates). Even if she genuinely could not afford the meal for some reason, it doesn’t make it right for her to take advantage of others. I paid for her meal maybe twice and both times she did not pay me back. I learnt my lesson the hard way and have avoided including her in my lunch plans from then on. However, she is still my manager so working with her is inevitable. Is it bad if I can’t see her in the same light ever again? It’s like I truly lost my respect for her even as a leader in my job.

Glad to say I got out of it, not 100% but I am doing way better than the past few months. It hurts to let go of the relationship because of the sweet precious memories. But removing the rose tinted glasses, which I am trying to do now, will help me recognise all the underlying issues. There are always the urge to bow down and beg for reconciliation, as I had done several times before. But now, it is time to face the issues and let them remind me of why leaving/letting the relationship go is the best for both of us. But honestly, it is never easy to just look at the issues and ignore the 'what-if's and 'what could have been of us if we stayed'. Hence, appreciate if you guys could share any stories of toxic relationships and the recovery. :) I have sought for support and help from the people around me but sometimes it is really difficult to hold back and waver again.

However, I like girls who are not so nice. Ok, I dont refer to girls who are abusing or throwing plates at people. These are girls are not evil but at the same time, they arent angels either. They are usually selfish and they dress like they going to party after class everyday. They dont actually care about other people but they dont go out of their way to hurt them either.
On the other hand, I dont actually feel attracted to girls who are caring, you know the ones that do volunteering or stay back to help other people after class. 
Of course, being the kind guy I am, the badass girls dont actually find me attractive. I am a kind, emphathetic and caring person which they dont find attractive (I know I repeated the sentence). They seem to go for the badass versions, like the guy versions of themselves, you know the selfish and sometimes even toxic kind.
The kind and caring girls are a 50 50. Some of them go for the kind guys whereas some go for the badass guys. 
None of these makes any sense to me. 
Also, can I do something to be more attractive to badass girls without losing my caring qualities?

I interviewed with another company, whose boss knows my current boss. Unfortunately, they talked, and this boss has also rejected me, citing my health reasons. In my current company, most of my colleagues expressed concern and understanding of my condition, with the exception of two, who bully me due to my health issues. They spread malicious remarks and mockery about my health condition, and even intentionally sabotage me at work to make me look bad. There are evidences to back these up from my other colleagues. These two are those who also think that working overtime is essential, although my work and schedule does not affect their work and schedule at all. I have raised this to my boss, which was also supported by my other colleagues who witnessed the bullying. Unfortunately, since my boss is prepared to terminate me, he dismissed me despite adequate evidence of wrongdoings. The surgery required for my condition is a major one with high risks, hence I am hesitant and putting much consideration into it.

PLUS I think just do the required grad requirements, make sure the 160 AUs at least by the end of final sem really do count and can be considered as grad requirements 就好了 (can already). 
Ofc I am not so dumb to say for e.g. exceed my 60-AU limit for level-1000 courses.. But well, you never know too. That’s why it’s IMPORTANT to have an updated Study Plan and communicate with say the COURSE PROGRAMME MANAGER (meaning, the admin staff who is in charge of and helps to facilitate academic matters in nature; especially for upper years of the degree course). Keep track also. I’m sure EduRec has some functions somewhere to do so etc etc. Something like that “what-if” thingy??? And “milestones” etc…
