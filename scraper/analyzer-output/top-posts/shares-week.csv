60934,107857,"Anything I need to know before marrying a Malaysian?
She is from JB and went to RGS when she was 13. Before that she went to several international schools all over the ASEAN region. NUS Med. I’m NUS Med too. Accent is indistinguishable from any Singaporean I know. Maybe a bit too atas but I don’t know if it’s because of RGS or because she’s from a really rich family in JB. Also my father is a taxi driver so I’m not exactly in her class. 
Her father owns 80% of a listco in Malaysia. Yet, very humble (almost cheap) family. Her father drives a 20-year-old Camry and refuses to buy a new car before his current one breaks. He does go all out in certain things, particularly education of his children and real estate. She has a paid-off 3-room condo to her name in Holland Village that her father bought for her. My girlfriend is also cheap. She thinks traveling for leisure is a waste of money, thinks Starbucks is a waste of money etc. Every time I meet her she would find a way to say something is a waste of money. I don’t mind this I’m poor anyway, but I would like to elevate my standard of living and I would like to travel for leisure one day.
My impression is Singaporeans have no conflict with Malaysians because we’re essentially the same culture but I also know this girl and her family enough to say that they are nothing like ordinary Malaysians. They speak only English at home, no religion, and they believe strongly in independence of women. Her father has spoken to me about marriage and he wants me to know that for banquet and wedding expenses, I don’t have to worry because what can be halved will be halved and for banquet he will pay for his own guests and only his own guests.  
My family on the other hand is conservative and my mom is very “Chinese.” Still places importance in Chinese culture and wants grandchildren very much. My girlfriend’s family has pretty much abandoned their Chinese culture (they don’t celebrate CNY for example). She also has no plans to have children early or at all.
The children issue is perhaps the main source of friction but I am lukewarm about having kids as well so I think I’d be able to ignore my mom. Other than that, my trepidation is in the disparity of socioeconomic class, which I am not socialized well enough to understand the issues that it could bring.
Trying to get some last thoughts. Greatly appreciated.

60937,107902,"I want to talk about rating people. We all rate people we choose. We rate them in terms of wealth, personality (we can vibe and is a good person) and appearance. 
I had a friend who had a crush on handsome and smart guy. The problem was that my friend was not pretty. However, she had a good personality, good sense of humour and was a kind person (does volunteering on weekends). Now, when she told our friend group, she had an immense backlash and everyone criticised that she is nowhere close to his level. Our friend group started to give ratings and she was rated 5 while the guy was rated a 9. This was a pure rating on appearance alone. 
Her crush being popular cycled through a bunch of girls who were quite pretty, a minimum of 8 solely based on appearance. However, I heard that there were clashes with the girls and finally, he found the girl that he clicked well with who was rated 9 on appearance as well as a 8 on personality. We knew this girl.
Sorry, this isn't a story about my friend getting her crush. This is real life and not a k-drama.
Since my friend was only 5, most of the guys who accepted her were also around 4-6 in terms of appearance. She cycled through them until she married guy who was 6 in terms of appearance and a 7 in terms of personality. 
My other friend who was around a 7 in terms of appearance got a guy who was a 5 in terms of appearance but was a 8 in terms of wealth and a 6 in terms of personality.
As much as I want to deny the idea of rating people and attaching numbers to a person solely based on the mentioned aspects, the reality is grimmer than that. I am sure people are going to come out and say that personality is more important than looks or wealth or any extrinsic values. The truth cannot be further than that. 
Let me explain.
If you are a 8 in terms of appearance, you will have a lot of guys showing interest in you. You probably will pick the best and you might not lower your standard so you probably pick a minimum of maybe 6 in terms of appearance and maybe makes up for it in terms of personality or wealth. You probably won't bother with anyone below that because you have enough options. You will cycle through your options until you maximise a high combined number for appearance, wealth and personality.
If you are a girl with an appearance of say 5. You will not get much options and similarly, you will cycle through your options to maximise your chances.
The irony is that the girl who an appearance rating of 8 but personality score of 6 might get a guy who has an appearance rating of 8 and personality rating of 8. However, the girl with an appearance rating of 5 and personality rating of 9 will never get a chance at the same guy. 
The only exception to this is if the guy interacts with the girl LONG ENOUGH and sees beyond the physical aspect. Most of whatever I said so far mainly ties with basic interactions (like meeting at an event) or dating apps where you might not know much about the person but you have to decide whether to pursue them or not. 
Basically, I am saying that the first filter is appearance/wealth and if you don't meet that rating for the guy or girl you like, you won't even be in their option list. Personality comes as an afterthought and ironically, takes more time for the person to appreciate. As mentioned, unless the person spends enough time with you to appreciate your personality, you will never be in their option list if you are poor (as a guy) or are ugly (both genders). In essence, pretty girls land with rich or/and handsome guys and vice-versa. 
Am I wrong? I am basing this from what I see happening around me. I wish I was wrong.

60935,107860,"I'm in my final year and I'm ashamed to say I've never dated before. I envy people who couple up easily. I would like to think I'm decent looking and have an ok personality. I just never thought of dating until recent months. 
Most of the ladies around me have friendzoned me long ago so how do I put myself out there for a start?
I'm interested in knowing this girl from another course but I think she doesn't even know that I exist. How do I make friends with her? Please help a noob virgin out. Thank you.

60933,107842,"Please, I really need help. I was born with a disease which can only be treated with surgery. My boss is going to terminate me because I am unable to do ridiculous things like working extremely overtime, as it takes a toll on my already sick body. However, my work quality is not compromised and surpasses most who work overtime. Many other colleagues and supervisors are witnesses to this. In my boss's eyes, working overtime is the quality of a good employee. He has found more foreign employees to take over my role already. I interviewed with another company, whose boss knows my current boss. Unfortunately, they talked, and this boss has also rejected me, citing my health reasons. In my current company, most of my colleagues expressed concern and understanding of my condition, with the exception of two, who bully me due to my health issues. They spread malicious remarks and mockery about my health condition, and even intentionally sabotage me at work to make me look bad. There are evidences to back these up from my other colleagues. These two are those who also think that working overtime is essential, although my work and schedule does not affect their work and schedule at all. I have raised this to my boss, which was also supported by my other colleagues who witnessed the bullying. Unfortunately, since my boss is prepared to terminate me, he dismissed me despite adequate evidence of wrongdoings. The surgery required for my condition is a major one with high risks, hence I am hesitant and putting much consideration into it. I feel very helpless that despite being a good worker and my condition not affecting my work significantly, I am being bullied and replaced in the workforce. I do not know what to do and I really need advice please, thank you.

60936,107862,"How do people cope?
If you've never experienced trauma, lucky you. If you've never been violated, lucky you.
If you've never been abused, lucky you. 
If you've never been abandoned, lucky you.
I had years of therapy and have been discharged. Even though talking to someone helped, learning how to cope helped, but it doesn't change the fact that these things happened and I am still facing the consequences of what happened. Some days I feel mentally drained when reminded. I also dread the day when I have to reveal what happened to me because I have to explain why some people are no longer in my life. And its likely I would not attend a few funerals that I'm supposed to attend.  
If something similar happened to you and you are not comfortable leaving a comment, could you make an anonymous post and share with me how you cope? 
Normal days I've been doing well. I stick to a routine so I'm in a good state of mind most days. I finally gone on a date for the first time in years. I didn't think we suit each other but I was glad I took the first step to normalcy.

60932,107841,"I've had it! I've been living in this apartment for years, and I can't take it anymore. It's like the resident living above me has a personal vendetta against peace and quiet. Every single morning, it's the same story – the vacuum cleaner orchestra starts blaring at the crack of dawn, as if they're auditioning for a cleaning competition.
But it doesn't stop there, oh no. Weird hours are fair game too. Who needs sleep when you can rearrange furniture at night? The screeching sound of sofas and tables being dragged across the floor is like nails on a chalkboard, except that chalkboard is my patience wearing thin.
And don't even get me started on the room doors. It's like they've taken up professional door slamming as a hobby. Bing, bang, bong – the symphony of noisy door closing is enough to make me want to invest in soundproof earmuffs for my own sanity. Drawers are closed in a loud bang sound too. Did the drawers offend them in any ways? Lmao 
And let's not forget the kitchen orchestra. Apparently, washing and storing utensils requires a grand performance. The clink, clank, clunk of metal cutlery being stashed is a daily reminder that quiet mealtimes are but a distant dream. 
Oh, and guess what? The nighttime brings a new act to the stage – the TV blaring at maximum volume until late at night. It's like my upstairs neighbor thinks they're hosting a late-night movie marathon for the entire building.
I'm all for harmonious living, but this is pushing me to the brink. It's time for the noise above to finally take a backseat. I deserve some tranquility in my own space.

60938,107879,"Why is CG3207 Comp Arch so hard? D:
Well… Then after that courses like CS4223 how? Fortunately, you can also either take/clear CS3210 or CG3207 as prereq for CS4223.
Lastly, there’s EE5518. Funnily all the above mentioned courses are all only offered in sem 1.. lmaoo
And EE5518’s prereq is EE4415 (sem 2). 
Lastly, say CS5222 Advanced Comp Arch is offered in sem 2. The idea is that one can take/clear their CS4223 in sem 1 then take CS5222 in sem 2
I mean… aside, there’s also CS5229 (sem 1) Advanced Computer Networks also. Prereq is to clear either CS4226 (sem 1) or EE4210 (sem 2)..
Anw, are UG students allowed to reach such level-5000 courses? I am guessing they can, so long they fulfil each of these respective courses’ prereqs~
But AIYAAA end of day I think I don’t want to be too ADVENTUROUS… lmfaoooo… this is also in view I don’t have “much time” i.e. it’s not say that I even have really many # of sems left in NUS.
PLUS I think just do the required grad requirements, make sure the 160 AUs at least by the end of final sem really do count and can be considered as grad requirements 就好了 (can already). 
Ofc I am not so dumb to say for e.g. exceed my 60-AU limit for level-1000 courses.. But well, you never know too. That’s why it’s IMPORTANT to have an updated Study Plan and communicate with say the COURSE PROGRAMME MANAGER (meaning, the admin staff who is in charge of and helps to facilitate academic matters in nature; especially for upper years of the degree course). Keep track also. I’m sure EduRec has some functions somewhere to do so etc etc. Something like that “what-if” thingy??? And “milestones” etc… 
1 step at a time; 1 sem at a time. That is, for now ????
