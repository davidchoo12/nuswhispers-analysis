60651,107226,"My boyfriend suggested me to join him and his family on a 2d1n Batam trip to celebrate Mother's Day. I casually agreed cause i'm available and free on that day too.
Upon buying the ticket, I asked him if we can go for a 1h message. Which he deny as he say we can only do stuff the mum wants to do as this is a celebration for her. Thus we should not do our own things.
Then i proceed to ask if late at night, when everyone is asleep can we at least spend some couple time, which he also deny. Cause he say he don't want his family seeing or hearing us.
I kind of regret agreeing to go cause he say this trip should be a bonding trip with his family. So now im wondering who is his mother? Cause it sounds like my 2d1n gotta revolve around this 'queen' -.-""

60639,107182,"Sorry long post ahead.
I'm not a graduate from NUS but my husband's mistress was.
If you are the one who met up with my husband and my 3 kids (with your own kid tagging along) at CC around Toa Payoh on 30 April and at Vivo Library on 15 April and eat at McD, hope you use your degree and brain to think properly. Did you know that he asked me to go back to work in his company (yes I left my job to work for him and he didn't pay my salary for years)1 week after I got C-section with our youngest daughter 3 years ago? I hope you really have a long thought about wrecking a family. Please note we still do couple things. What makes you think he is faithful to you if he is cheating with his wife?
I have been enduring his infidelity for 10 years, can you handle that?
Hope you are happy wrecking our family.

60652,107227,"Hi all,
I am writing this with extreme fear.
I am a Science graduate and I worked for an up and coming company in the cellular agricultural space. When I used to read the news about this company, I thought this was my chance to be involved in a field which can potentially disrupt how we consume food. So, i jumped on the opportunity and joined this company. This is the end of a good part of the story.
After I joined, I was really excited to work for this company. The first few weeks were like a breeze. I came to the office to learn about different aspects of this field, attend meetings, go for lunch in this ulu place with one hawker centre with colleagues and also observe people do work. When I got my opportunity to do hands-on work, I was ecstatic. After a few days, I started to get frustrated as I was not able to get any cool results , whereas others in the meeting were discussing how well their experiments worked. After a few months of frustration, I started to ask for help with my experiments and materials from my reporting officers and colleagues. They will give me some materials and when I redo the experiments and fail again. Then, I started asking some more detailed questions and I got the statement "" I don't have access to that information"". But in the meantime, some people in my group revealed that they just say whatever the boss wants.
That's when I started to talk to more people from other departments and realised that we don't have anything that has been claimed by the boss in the media. For example, our company revealed that they had successfully created a shrimp cell line (we didn't have any working cells), company mentioned that we had successfully reduced the cost of cultivated shrimp meat production. No one in the company knew how to achieve that. We inaugurated a production plant. After that, no one has used it for any purpose (A big expensive bioreactor, except for photoshoots). With all these falsehoods, I dawned on me, i had joined a company that looked more like one of those companies in the US (ther-o-anus) where everything is mired in secrecy but in reality they didn't have anything.
To add to my research frustration, our boss used to hold a company-wide meeting to publicly shame departments who didn't have much progress. And will tell us to give 200%, make yourself useful to the company and all those Bullshit. Then she will be vacationing in some exotic location. We had an inside joke. She was always on vacation, but stated that she was at work. yeah right, 2 months vacation for work and post 2 meeting pictures. Come-on, lah, you think we all don't know what it means.
Our boss runs the company like a friend and family business. At one time, her husband, her sister-in-law, her previous lab mates, previous room mates, her previous institute mates, all mates were in the company. After so much complaining about the uselessness of these people, the company fired a few of them.
In the beginning, i mentioned that I was scared to write this. It is mainly because our boss, like all other dubious companies, goes after people with legal sticks using company money. So, i am writing here.
Hope this post encourages people who are working in this company and previous employees to come forward to expose this scam of a company.

Feeling dejected, I roll across the bed and stand up to realise that I'm not in outfield but in my bedroom. In the bathroom, I rush to complete everything asap, I'm out in five minutes tops. Have to report early. At the doorstep, I remember urgently that I forgot to polish my boots. I'm putting on sneakers.
During heavy rain/storm, the background droplets of rain
pelting the ground and striking claps of thunder. Suddenly I'm in the jungle, boots on muddied grass. The whistling of bullet noises all round me. I realise I'm out of position. I'm riding the MRT back home.
During meals, I begin by eating as fast as I can, dreading the shell-scrape I have to dig later. There's no objective to meet, to rush to wait and there's a perfectly good toilet in the cafeteria I'm at.
When I'm called upon to answer, ingrained man-mode kicks in. I'm on the courtyard where the safe answer is the best answer or it's hands and feet on the ground where the gruelling cycle of physical discomfort begins. I'm in tutorial on campus.
It's been almost a year out of out of the jungle but for some reason, a part of me remains there.

60644,107196,"This is my confession.
I matriculated into nus half a decade ago and was fortunate to be in a chill course that did not take up many school days.
So, I decided to take up internships during my first year, during before summer break started. Year 2, I decided to stop so that I can try other types of internships,but was rejected form the one I wanted, hence I decided to only take up an internship during break cause bo-pian. Doing so, I had alot of free time left and was quite bored. I then decided to sneak into other faculties lectures to fill up the time. After a month of doing so, I realised that what I wanted to do was entirely different from the course I was studying.
Now, I work at wall-street and the hours are absolutely dreadful, 7am in the office and ends at12 midnight on a lucky day,, 1+ to 2am on a normal day. No such thing as holidays, weekends. Sometimes I even dream that I'm at work, working then waking up to go to work.
Now I lament, and am starting to regret the previous decision leading to my change in course direction and should have stuck to my original course. What is the point of money if my life is having my ass stuck to this damn chair staring at 5-6 screens all day.
