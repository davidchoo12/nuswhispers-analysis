60682,107559,"I'm (M30) a rather successful social media influencer. But hear me out, it's not what you think it is.
My wife (F29) is someone who likes to talk about and shares whatever she sees on social media. She'll be doomscrolling TikTok the entire day, frequently sending me videos of influencers showing off their branded goods, having fun at holiday locations, etc and asking me when I will bring her there. Bitch please, I just left my cushy corporate job to start my own business, ain't nobody got time for that shit.
She was getting really annoying so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I decided to start influencing her social media feed. I used her laptop and to google for sports, crypto news, AI news, etc, stuff that I know she won't be interested in, searched for similar stuff on TikTok and started liking and following content creators she won't be interested in.
At first I thought it didn't work, but after a week I realized she wasn’t using TikTok that much and I asked her why. She complained that her feed was really boring and nothing she saw interested her. It was WORKING!
I decided to take things a step further by making her see stuff she's moderately interested in, yet is useful so that they'll slowly influence her lifestyle. She has gained a bit of weight since our wedding but she’s too lazy to start exercising, so I started using her account to follow some fitness and health influencers.
Guess what, a week later she dragged me to sign up for a gym membership together and booked some yoga classes. I’m pretty fit myself so I don’t really need that but I’m happy to see that she's doing something about her health. It has been a few months and she looks much healthier. I'm super happy with the results of my ""social media influencing"".
Guys, social media is such a powerful tool. Do try out ""social media influencing"" on your family/partners/kids and you might be surprised by the results.

60683,107531,"NUS architecture school in Singapore makes my head pain and is just a big scam! we are all fed up and really regret choosing this course.
Firstly, they all talking cock about our school's 5-year program. They say it's meant to prepare us to make safe and sturdy buildings, but school just whack us with design projects that are totally not practical.. But, NUS architecture never really teach us this important stuff!
Instead, they make us do many-many design projects, like keep playing Lego only. Also, why our course so long one? Got extra year but no extra skill. What for we give them more money and waste our time? No point the school, likes to use NUS brand and say its a top school.
Really scam all the way. scam the parents, scam the public.
Secondly, some say the schools and professors, only care about money. These professors maybe also don't know the practical things, that's why they become teachers. They just want to sit in the ivory tower, act blur, and enjoy the 'college good old days' forever and ever. Then, the big shots in the school just extend the course, because they think got professional feeling.
Another thing is, they keep selling us dreams. But when we finally graduate and step into the real world, then we kena shock. Suddenly, everything different from what we learn in school. Then we work like dog, but the pay peanuts. How to pay back student loans or make a living, and settle down?
Also got some seniors, say their employers think their education useless one. They spend five years studying architecture, but still kena call ""worthless"" in their own field. Simi sai is this?
So, everyone out there, you better think properly before you sign up for architecture school. It's like they play punk with you only. Kena conned big time, leh!

60681,107518,"To all NUS boys and male alumnis,
Have you ever wonder what happens to a victim of sexual assault after 20 years?
You may have seen news that sexual predators go to jail for a couple of months or a few years.
This pales in comparison to the suffering of a ""survivor"" of sexual assault!
Yes, I have gone for counselling
Yes, I have gone for therapy
Yes, I have got whatever help I could and still getting help.
While I'm still able to function daily, it's not normal to have insomnia and be fearful of sleeping. To feel unprotected and afraid someone might assault you again. To be constantly stressed.
To still have nightmares because these memories stay in your subconscious.
To affect your relationships or marriages because certain actions or words or situations can cause flashback, and you either want to run, freeze or hide in terror. And you feel sorry, embarrassed about your behaviour.
Dear men of society, if you ever have thoughts of preying on females, please consider this long-term consequence on your victims and prevent your fantasies from turning into tragic realities.
