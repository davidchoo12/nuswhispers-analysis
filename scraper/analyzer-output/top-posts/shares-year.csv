55603,95616,"I am 20 and my bf is 22 and he is currently in NS which means he earns barely enough to support me.
Whenever I request to eat something that is apparently not very comfortable to his wallet (not sure what that means), he will always insist we eat at a nearby foodcourt or hawker?
Firstly, places like that are usually very dirty and hot like why would I even consider dining there? The food's good but he brought me out for a date so I shouldn't even be expecting him to request us to eat there? Like it's a date and I barely get to see him because he only books out on the weekend.
Secondly, I prefer food that looks pretty so I can take Instagram worthy pictures of it and have my bragging rights?
Lastly, I don't want to be seen dressed up in a very cute dress while at a hawker? That doesn't look pretty to me anymore.
Even when eating out at a mall, I was obviously craving for pasta and of course I wanted Hoshino, but he could only offer to dine in at Saizeriya because it was cheaper for him. Wtf? I will never step foot into that restaurant knowing that is where all the poor people go to when they want to eat pasta and try to pretend they are atas, BECAUSE WESTERN IS EXPENSIVE. Eventually we did ended up in Hoshino, but he didn't order his food because mine was already $13 which is double of what is offered at Saizeriya in terms of price. Whatever, at least I got to eat what I wanted :). He then went home and cook Maggie for himself? How broke can anyone be? Don't get a girlfriend if you can't afford it, especially when you're in NS.
I need some advice and or suggestions to open up my bf's wallet like stop being stingy...

We have nice conversations and sometimes we laugh together. But, I see no future in us. I think I am more into the more muscular type of guys and at least drive. But last week, he did something totally unexpected. omg. You know the durian season is here and the people here are all nuts for this. He suggested we buy some durians and eat at my place. He then chose some durians himself. omg. I never knew he has these skills. He declined the opening of the fruit and insisted to open the fruit at home. woah. once at home, he displayed his opening and cutting skills. You know the part where you needed to bend and push the fruit lips apart to get the seeds? omg, he did with such strength. I admit, I was a bit wet and turned on. omg, such hidden skills. what should I do now?

56677,98584,"To those who felt that you are at the stage if talking about settling down instead of breaking up with your boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't seem to be the right one, trust me, it's never too late. It's better to break it off now instead of marrying the wrong one.
I am a 过来人. I was 28 (F) when I broke off with my then bf of 3 years. We already talked about marriage, applied for BTO, planned for our future wedding dates, etc. Everyone thought that we will definitely get married one day. But others don't see what's really happening between us. He is a smart guy, with high paying job and constantly given praises by people around him. Basically he is like the Mr Perfect in everyone's eye. He was the one who chased me. When we first got together, we felt like we complement each other. Eventually, it started to become me chasing after his perfection. Like because he is this perfect, I need go be as perfect. And no, he didn't tell me it is ok to be who I am cause that's who he really loves, he expects me to be as perfect as him. He finds me watching drama, reading blogs all these as wasting my time away (PS: I only do it once I'm done with my work). He always talk on the phone about work and when I commented that I didnt get enough attention from him, he said at least he is doing something that earns money and not laze around. But I was in love. Afterall, he is the Mr Perfect and everyone tells me how I should not lose him. Then it started to take a toll on my mental health, crying to sleep everynight cause I felt like I was never good enough. I communicated the issues with him and he didn't feel like he has any wrong. Eventually, we decided to go on our separate ways, and gave up on our BTO.
The rs was so painful that it took me 2 years to decide that I need to start opening my heart again. Went on some dates (dating app) and went on a few dates with those I thought we have chemistry when talking via app but ZERO chemistry when we met irl.
At 33 years old, I met a guy via mutual friend. We hit off instantly. I really enjoyed talking to him. He is not perfect.. not well educated, earn less than me, slightly shorter than me, few years younger than me. To put it bluntly, people would say he ""pick until gold"" if I ever agree to be his gf. I shared with my friends that I was interested in him and none of my friends felt that we can work out cause he is too different from my previous Mr Perfect style. But I went ahead to agree to be his gf within one month after knowing him.
And fast forward, I am 37 year old now. He proposed to me after we were together for only 3 months cause he felt like I am the one for him, just as how I also told him I felt like he is the one for me. We got married 10 months after getting together. We are going to celebrate our 3 years wedding anniversary soon and our first son came out just last year.
Couples can be together for 10 years and still breakup while couples who are tgt for 10 days could meant for ever. Length of rs does not determine how successful the rs will be. It could be 10 years old quarrel or 10 months of working towards being one. So it is never too late to break up with the wrong one. I thought I was gonna be single for life but my soul mate appeared when I was no longer looking. It may be late but it's better than suffering all my life being with the wrong one.
Don't ever decide your life based on society norms. Do what you think is best for you and your mental health. Ask yourself what makes you happy and do all the happy things when you are single. Share those happy moments when you meet your future soul mate down the road and eventually share more happy moments when you find the one.
Jiayou!

56278,97257,"I am a 35/M and I went to a top secondary school and JC in Bishan.
I grew up around teenagers who prided themselves on their academic performance, on their CCA performance, and believed strongly that they will become highly successful people in the future. I had 2 classmates in JC, now best friends, who told me that they will hit a million dollars in annual salary by the time they reach 35, both of whom went to Oxbridge. Every single straight-A type that I knew had this air of arrogance around them, because I truly believe that they believed that they were better than the rest of us, that they will unerringly turn out to be more successful than any of us.
There was this girl I met in J1. She was a quiet girl who was from a neighborhood secondary school who happened to be in the same OG and class as I was. She was really timorous, really shy. She didn't have the best grades, and was notorious for skipping CCA. I was always confused by how nonchalant she was about schoolwork, how she always copies my homework, and how I have never once seen her studying. She eventually retained, and I lost contact with her.
I was recently having coffee alone at a cafe. She was fiddling around with the POS system. I recognized her immediately because she looked exactly the same as she did in JC. She did her hair up the same way. I approached her to say hello, and she told a younger girl to make her a flat white, and she came to sit with me at my table.
We started chatting about the old days, and I found out she got BCCC/B at A-levels, and did business at SMU. It also turns out that she owns the cafe, along with 13 other F&B establishments in Singapore and JB. Her share of the profits in 2018? 2.7 million. I was speechless for a while. Meanwhile my friends who went to Oxbridge, one of whom on a PSC scholarship, are now civil servants, both earning just a little between 10-15K a month. That's a good salary, but I was mediocre in JC (ABBC/A) and even I am earning more than 15K as a management consultant.
We have created a system of flawed meritocracy where children are brought up believing that just because you are the best in school, you're always going to be best in life. The logic is flawed because being the best in school just means you're going to be ""good"" in life. In most cases, you're just as likely as anyone to become ""great.""
If we think about it, kids become great in school because they understand the system well, and because there is generally a very clear methodology to become great. As long as you don't challenge the system, as long as you work within the ""rules,"" you'll come out on top. In the real world, there are several lines of work in which it is valuable to be able to work well within a system. The SAF for example. Probably explains why the word ""scholar"" always gets paired up with ""general"" in Singapore.
I think we, as a nation, need more humility when we think that the best people in school deserve more praise than any other student. People are good at different things, and school, being able to follow instructions to the hilt, is just one thing.

55182,94643,"Tldr: Just broke up with my fiance whom I share a joint account with. Am I the asshole for asking for 100% of the money in our joint account because I think he should compensate me for my time wasted on him?
I have been dating my fiance for 3 years and we have been working for 2 years since graduating. He proposed to me last december and since then, I have been asking him to plan for our wedding, which I would prefer to be held as soon as possible because I am tired of working and want to be a housewife.
He told me he would prefer to have the wedding next year because he needs some time to plan the wedding but I want it to be held preferably by end of this year. Since he has agreed to stay at my parents’ house after marriage then there shouldn’t be any issues at all.
I just cannot understand why he wants to wait until next year to have the wedding because actually I was asking for a very simple wedding. I only wanted to invite our friends and relatives to a dinner at a mid-tier hotel like Pan Pacific and to get very affordable wedding bands like Cartier. He certainly can afford them because he has $30k in his personal savings account and he earns $5k a month.
I’m not even asking for much because I know there are way more expensive places to hold a banquet and way more high-end jewellery brands to get wedding bands from. But he thinks that the wedding bands and hotels I chose are too extravagant even though I have offered to help him pay 20% of all expenses. Because of all these issues, we quarrelled a lot and eventually I decided to break up with him because I realise he’s a very selfish person who doesn’t even care about what I want at all. Even the engagement ring he got for me was a small 0.9 carat which cost only $9k although I have specifically told him that I wanted a 1.5 carat.
Now that we have broken up, we are in the midst of discussing how to split our joint account money and he said he will give me half of the money inside, which is only $10k. His excuse for giving me only half of the money is that he was the only one contributing to the joint account. He did contributed to 100% of the joint account but I was the one who encouraged him to save up. Whenever he wanted to buy useless things like Nintendo Switch, I stopped him from buying them. Without me, he wouldn’t even have savings at all. Moreover, I wasted 3 years of my life on him so I think I deserve more than $10k. Honestly, even if he gives me all the money, which is merely $20k, I still don’t think it’s enough to compensate for the 3 years. But he seems reluctant to give me 100% of the money and kept giving me all sorts of lame excuses. Should I continue to ask for $20k or should I just settle for $10k? I’m so tired of fighting over this.

56752,98792,"For those who are considering joining the real estate industry as a real estate agent; PLEASE I urge u to think twice. Especially if you’re leaving a stable salaried job to do this.
Don’t be fooled by the posts of your friend posting their awards & fancy cars and shit on social media and think it’s so easy. It’s not.
Don’t get brainwashed by the managers who are trying to recruit you that it’s such good money and that you can also do it. They earn an overriding commission from their team members so of course the more the merrier. My team manager makes $30-60k a month alone on his team overriding commission; and that’s on top of his own sales. Don’t forget that these people are highly skilled salesmen who can sell ice to eskimos.
The reality is that only the TOP 1-5% of ALL agents make good money & the rest are barely making it. I am not exaggerating. The people in the Top 5% are making all the money.
If you’re not in the Top 5%, u can totally forget about it. There’s over 30,000 agents in Singapore- u do the Maths.
In my first 2-3years, I burned through all my hard earned savings on PropertyGuru credits (I think burned about 5k), various training courses (3k here and 6k there), various apps & misc expenses.
Besides PropertyGuru, there’s also EdgeProp & 99.co- also need to buy credits.
Another 20-30k burned on Facebook & Google Ads.
In this industry you will burn a lot of money first (easily 20k or more in your first year) before u even make your first cent.
If you do not have at least 12 months of expenses saved PLUS min $20k for all these necessary expenses, don’t even consider it.
That’s not the worst part. Just because u burn money on PropertyGuru, Facebook & Google Ads doesn’t mean u will get genuine leads.
95% of all your leads are time wasters. They don’t respond when u contact them. Msg never reply. Or they will make appointment with you & then never show up. A lot of people who fill up your lead form on Facebook are just bored and have no genuine intention to sell or buy property. Cold leads from online marketing are almost impossible to close. Most of them are just “look see only”. I spent over $20k to learn this the hard way. Don’t be like me.
I cannot tell u how many times people have flown my plane. I travel down to the location and waited for an hour & the person never show up.
If you’re a woman, you’ll constantly get harassed by nuisance calls and texts by random male strangers. Because our contact number is readily available online, many men will think it’s okay to take your number and abuse it freely. Pretend to be a buyer interested to buy property, and then after wasting your time for hours, ask if you’re single.
Everyday I will get at least one dodgy text or DM from some creepy anonymous male stranger on various platforms. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
This year after deducting expenses, not only did I not make any $$, I lost around $15-20k.
It’s depressing to think that the people working in McD & cleaners actually earn more than me.
The truth is- You’ll HATE the job UNLESS you’re a natural salesman who genuinely loves interacting with people. The key words being “GENUINELY LOVES”.
I am an introvert, I hate going out, I hate interacting with people in general and I suffer everyday in this job.
So please take my advice. Don’t do it. It’s very painful & not as lucrative as many people think.
Most agents make around $50-100k a year? Might as well stick to a regular day job with CPF and benefits.
The real perk is the security of knowing u have a fixed paycheck coming in every month.
The dumbest thing one can do is leave a stable salaried job for this fucking “job” where U actually have to pay money to do shit U hate & talk to people u can’t stand, everyday going around for viewing after viewing after viewing like a free fucking tour guide.
People don’t care about wasting your time, cos you’re just an agent.
Nobody will tell u this shit because frankly those who are struggling won’t admit to anyone they’re struggling, and the few who are doing very well won’t understand why you’re struggling.
I just wish somebody had told me this shit years ago.

56799,98938,"Dear Prof. Ben,
Since you went to RI, I’m sure you would have gotten to know some classmates/schoolmates who have now become wildly successful in their careers. And by wildly successful, I do mean very wealthy. I also don’t mean the punch-cards who are working upper-middle class jobs, being paid upper-middle class wages. I mean those who are being paid millions a year, or entrepreneurs whose businesses are making millions a year in profit.
Since you were probably at the top of your cohort, do you secretly wish that you “deserve” more success than you have now? Or that they don’t deserve the wealth they’ve accumulated for not being as smart (or as hardworking) as you were in high school or in college?
I ask this question because I went to Hwa Chong and I was among the top of my cohort. I pursued academia at first, because it was what I was really good at (just generally learning stuff deeply). I dragged my ass through grad school and ended up doing dead-end research for 5 years before I started a job in the industry (CS) where I was paid the same as people 10 years my junior, doing work that to me, is in all sense of the word—stupid.
I have some ex-classmates who are now living in detached houses around Bukit Timah, driving luxury cars, one of whom was a middling student who used to copy my homework (he was smart just lazy). Almost every one of my crazy-rich ex-classmates are business owners, none of whom were particularly talented back in Hwa Chong.
Maybe wealth doesn’t mean much to you, but I was hoping you could help me reconcile being one of the smartest person in school and now having to capitulate to the reality there’s little profit in being so academically-inclined.

55205,94699,"Should I marry my boyfriend if I’m not physically attracted to him?
I’m 27 years old and my bf is 35. We have been together for 7 years and have just paid the downpayment for our BTO. Our wedding would be held in June this year.
When I first met my bf, I had just gotten out of a two-year relationship with my ex and I only intended to use my bf as a rebound to get over my ex. Since my bf was just a rebound, I didn’t care that he’s ugly. In terms of appearance, he’s at most 5/10 but I’m 8/10. Sadly, he’s also very short and skinny (170cm,62kg). Worst of all, he earns very little ($5k/month). My ideal guy has always been someone who is at least 180cm and earns at least $10k/month.
My bf looks ugly but character wise, he’s the nicest guy I’ve ever seen. Throughout the past 7 years, I have tried dating other men. But the guys I dated were not as nice. Some of them had severe commitment issues and some were assholes who cheated on me. On the contrary, my bf has always been a very loyal and loving bf for the past 7 years. To me, my bf feels like someone I could always depend on and that is why I love him so much.
The only problem that I’m facing is, I am not physically attracted to my bf and I cannot imagine being physically intimate with him. Because of this, I told him that I want to wait until marriage to have sex when in fact I already had sex with those guys I dated in the past 7 years. Up till today, I still feel very guilty for what I have done and this is also one of my biggest regrets.
I feel very guilty that I enjoy getting intimate with other men but I still refuse to get intimate with my bf. Recently, I’m starting to feel very worried about having to get intimate with him after wedding. After so many years, I still feel uncomfortable kissing him and when I kiss him, I always have to imagine I’m kissing my crush. And sometimes I really regret applying for BTO with him. But honestly, I don’t mind dating him. I just don’t know if I should marry him. Has anyone been in my shoes? Has anyone married someone you’re not physically attracted to? Is it possible to have a marriage without physical attraction?

He first when on a rant or long explanation or story to put it
He told me he was form Jc(a top one at that)
Then he went on about how he wants to save $1M by age 30 he's like 27M and working in a bank . I on the other had am just 22F
He then explained how his father is so and so and has a PhD and how he lives in one of those huge ass bungolws I think he used the term GBB or GCB
So then I asked him oh what's that ,he then replied its just a big bungolw ,you don't know ah? Its quite a high ses thing, not many know
He even treated the waiter badly asking him to 'come here' ,no pls no tq or anything.
He then asked what my parents do ,I said oh they are hawkers...
His face changed he asked so you are doing this degree(medicine) to get out of poverty huh .?
I said no I am not i genuinely want to help people out ,why do you think that? I said softy holding in my disgust
He said well you're from poly and your family probably doesn't earn much...and must be not so educated so thats why you want to become a doctor?
Softy again I said ,no I don't think you can stereotype that way
You must be a minority of med students who want to help..thats good he said .
Yeah,I said
Halfway he asked if he can send me home ,I told him no need (I wanted the date to end asap)
He said well I have a lamborghini you know
No thanks ,I'll take train can liao
But I bet you haven't been in one cause your poor he said loudly.
This pissed me off,
I told him ,why you no money buy your own car is it its clearly your dad's car!
Do you think a small ass car will impress me?
Why must I go with you ?
Why did you assume i am poor? You think so so big ah?
He then replied

You poor girl, you're just a gold digging bi**h
You think you are my standard?
I then replied
Stalls !! my family owns a few hakwer stalls
Don't ever judge again you disgusting son of a boofon, idk how that slipped out but I was indeed pissed.
I slaped him and walked off ,leaving $30 to the cahsier for my order
Can't believe that there are guys like this...
Seriously wtf sia ,why do some guys drive daddys car and say its theirs and think that their parents wealth is their's???
Ps. My mom graduated from a top culinary school, my dad is also a uni gardaute
And please don't look down at hawkers, having worked at my parents stall ,I've seen uncles who are primary 3 dropouts who earn millions and yet they are humble and give out food to needy on weekends, and they take in like $5000 a day ,selling drinks only....

56704,98661,"The tech industry in Singapore and Computer Science is now at the top of the food chain and the forefront of development. It can be said that CS and Tech are the king of all jobs right now. Computing students have both the money and the power, they earn a lot and are generally respected by our society. This is just a small but true story to demonstrate why the tech industry is blooming:
My younger brother (born 1995) have just graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering at NUS. However, instead of going for the traditional ME role, he self-taught everything about programming and software engineering, signed up for CS modules as his UEs, and worked remotely for a mid-tier American company for 2 years. He went to class in the morning and went online for only 3 - 4 hours every night to have his works done, earning an official net monthly salary of 3600 USD - or about 4800 SGD. But the main income actually comes from the freelance and commissioned outside projects - completing 1 to 2 of these every week and he could easily earn 9k - 10k SGD in total without paying any additional dollar of tax. After working for nearly 3 years, he now owns a car and a large condominium in Orchard.
Almost every girl are infatuated whenever they hear about IT guys and software engineers. There is this girl studying oversea in Australia, coming back here in Singapore to work and was referred by her older sister to work at the same bank. For some unknown reasons, when my younger brother goes to that bank and doing some transactions, he got both the girl and her elder sister at the same time, and all three started to live with each other in my younger brother's condominium. The two sisters are hailed from a relatively wealthy and prestigious family, with the father being a university professor and the mother working as a civil servant for the government.
When the parents first heard about the news of all three of them living together, they are quite angry and threaten to disown the two sisters. However, after hearing that my younger brother works in the tech industry, they completely changed their attitude towards him. They called and inquired him almost every week, giving him gifts and doing everything to push him to marry their precious daughters as quickly as possible, so as not to miss on the opportunity. My younger brother should have married the elder sister this month, but due to Covid-19 restrictions and some other issues, they have been delaying their wedding ceremony.

Due to my needs, I recently hired a sugarbaby who is currently studying in NUS. She is pretty and sexy, but she is very seductive to an extend that she can make me lose control of myself in decision making. She made me transferred the ownership of the condominium worth 1.5mil to her and also almost all my savings to her as well. I was stupid enough comply with her. Furthermore, every month I continued to give her 10k allowances.
I started to regret as i am left with almost nothing now. But i am really addicted to her and cant stop myself from giving everything to her. I am also scared if i stop giving her 10k per month, she will kick me out of the condo which is under her name now. Can anyone advice me?? How should i seek help to stop my hornyness and addiction against her?

55198,94676,"Saw the recent story about the girl who asked her bf for money and she reminded me of myself. I’m just like her, a very materialistic girl.
I grew up in a low income family where my parents worked hard to give me a better childhood than the ones they had. They grew up in poverty and were forced to quit their primary schools to go out to work and help support their families.
Growing up, my mom has always encouraged me to study hard and get into the top university, not because she wanted me to find a good job but because she wanted me to find a rich boyfriend. She believed that rich kids would often study at the best schools and entering these schools would give me an opportunity to meet these rich kids.
Indeed my mom was right. When I entered university, I met my first boyfriend, who was a typical rich kid. His parents owned a construction firm and he was the oldest child and would take over the company in future. He was perfect in every way and we loved each other deeply and wanted to get married after we graduate.
After graduating, we went around looking at houses. One day he saw a house he fancied and told me how he would love to live in it. Since then, I started to feel uneasy whenever I saw him. But I convinced myself that I was making the right decision to marry him because he’s handsome and rich and he loves me so much. What could go wrong?
The day after he told his family about the house he fancied, I started to panic and suddenly I broke down in tears and told him I want to break up with him. He cried and begged me to reconsider my decision but I lied to him that I don’t like his parents and can’t get along with them. Nevertheless, he tried to win me back until I decided to lie to him that I found a new boyfriend.
After everything that happened, I realised I fell in love with his money, not him. I did everything I could to make him happy, not because I love him but because I wanted him to love me and give me everything.
I was so wrong to think that money can buy me happiness. Strangely, when he brought me to all the top fine dining restaurants, all the condo showrooms to choose our house and the high end jewellery boutiques to choose my rings, I didn’t feel happy at all. Everything just felt like an achievement unlocked, an ego booster. Fortunately, I hesitated and did not buy any ring or house with him.
For a very long time, I could not forgive myself for breaking his heart. I would often ask our mutual friends to check on him until I heard he found a new girlfriend. About a year later, I met someone new and I could finally move on and forgive myself.
Just like me, my current boyfriend came from a poor background and we were colleagues at a small firm. Our dates were routine and simple, we would eat at the McDonald’s opposite my house or buy Campbell soup from Giant and cook our own dinner. Life was simple but those were the best days of my life.
Ever since my boyfriend found a new job that requires more OT, he has been very busy. However, he still finds time to meet me and surprises me with food I love. A few months ago, he brought me to the same jewellery store which my ex brought me to and asked me to choose a ring. As I was looking at the rings, I felt like the rings are so beautiful. However, I told him I would rather he save up the money for our BTO renovation and warned him that I would return the ring if he ever bought it. Today, he surprised me with a proposal and proposed to me with the ring he bought from the store we visited.
The truth is he has been saving up for the ring for a very long time and he even changed his job to earn more money so he can afford the ring. He’s not a romantic person but he asked his married friends for advice and did a lot of research to give me the best proposal I have ever seen.
Some years ago, I stepped into the same jewellery shop and felt a sense of emptiness. The ring was beautiful but it did not make me feel anything. Some years later, I am wearing the same ring but I feel like the happiest girl in the world.
It was never about the ring. It is the person you are with that matters.

54905,93942,"Female (21) just need a place to rant urghh????.
Just broke up with my boyfriend (you know who you are) over his obsession with Japanese Cartoons. He was so sweet and nice when we first met as friends but as we got closer and closer he started to reveal his degenerate “Otakooo” side.
At first I was pretty ok with it since I thought it was just a minor side interest (we used to go to bar hoping and partying quite a fair bit), but after we started going out he exposed more of more of his disgusting hobby to me. I decided to put up with it since he was such a nice guy but it eventually got on my nerves and I had no choice but to ghost him.
The final straw that made me write this was browsing thru HWZ (thanks to him, ughhhh) and realising that so many of Singaporean guys are also these disgusting, misogynistic ootakoos. My girlfriends tell me that it’s very normal but I just can’t stand the thought of so many Singaporean guys being interested in such immature and disgusting hobbies. Have I been living under a rock these past 21 (going 22 soon Xp) years?

57024,99590,"Now is the season when fresh grads enter job market right? Come let gor gor here teach y'all a few Pippo(tips) to acclimatise to the working world:
1. Have good relationships with the secretaries. Very important. They know where the stationery are, which catering companies to look at when you need to plan events. Which executive to look for in another department. Befriend the secretaries. Treat them like goddesses. Cos you never know, your next meeting session with their bosses rest in their hands.
2. Don't be alarmed when you are told to change your slide design. Accept the fact that each manager has a penchant for specific fonts for titles and subtitles. I will always remember my ex boss. Title don't 16, subtitle font 14, content font 12. Redo. Dumbfounded. Also, if you work in a big corporation, ask your colleagues if there are company slide templates. Viola. No need to search and do up fancy slides. Company presentations don't care about zooming in and out of slides. Fancy animations and all. Who has the time to care about how aesthetically appealing your background is. What's more important is the content. Clear and easy to understand please.
3. Learn the ropes as fast as you can. Keep asking since you are fresh. Once you are not fresh, and you still ask a lot of questions, they will start to question your question. In some situations however, if you are not taught something, it's still ok to ask.
4. In some companies, believe it or not, deeply rooted traditions still exist. Classic example: don't leave on the dot at 6pm even if you've finished your work. Dilly dally a bit more. Maybe around 15 to 30 mins then zao. You know the answer to this right. Don't need to explain much.
5. Forgot to say this. Really really. Be good friends with your colleagues. Non managerial ones. They will be your source of support, comfort and office politics gossip. Who shouts at who before, who more approachable. Who is who where is where. How to connect printer to your laptop. How to submit request for stuff in the portal. Colleagues are super important when you don't want to appear like you know nothing. Why? If you keep asking your manager questions, he or she might think that you are not attentive when they are teaching you. But in the first place you are not taught that thing, or you didn't manage to jot it down in time. In this case, ask your colleagues. Confirm one of them know. 5 colleagues? Ask each of them in a rotation fashion. One question per week for each person if you need to. This way, they also won't think you are a nuisance.
6. Make full use of pantry if there is one. Gope the biscuits and snacks. You will need it for OT and when you skip lunch to rush the report.
7. Don't be gehkiang and be too outspoken. Newbies in the industry. Be quiet and observe. Speak up only when you have some grasp of how the department or industry works. Don't laokui (embarrassed) yourself in front of people especially in meetings. They tell you to speak up, but they want constructive and pertinent comments, not some elementary and basic queries that can be easily resolved offline or in emails. So, have questions? Ask your direct colleagues or staff. Not in meetings, not unless you know what the rest are doing.
8. Dept lunches. First few weeks you cannot escape. Tahan. Just tahan. I know you want to be alone. Watch your drama during lunch. But just tahan. Wait for a few weeks. Then slowly ease out of your lunch existence. Excuses can be busy with work, brought lunch already. Why cannot eat alone on first week? Remember connections? Yes. Build connections first. You need to know where that stapler is. Lunch breaks are important channels to pose queries. Make use of them.
9. They say don't anticipate. But I say do it. Always be a worry cat. Always think of what's to come next. Don't be too optimistic about stuff. Always be prepared to be rejected on the first draft. You can give it your all on the first try, but be prepared. Your all is not their all. Anticipate. Brace yourself for rejection. Strive on.
10. Lastly, after all the office survival tips, this might just be the most essential one. Know the food around. Know what the options are. Is there a cafe? Is there a bakery? Is there a kopitiam? Feeling splurgy? Order that latte. Feeling thrifty. Buy that 3 dollar cai png. Some places even have staff discount. On tight budget? Know where the convenience store is. Sometimes they have cheap offers. Know your food options. That's the least you can do to tahan through the rest of the afternoon until you knock off.
Happy working.

1. Not every girl wants to get married by 23. So before you ASSUME she's of marriageable age, ask her what her views on marriage are. One hint, might save you the drama- just because she does not want to get married now does not mean she never will. She has other plans for herself right now, let her live a little.
2. Just because a girl wishes to do her PhD after Masters does not mean she doesn't want to settle down in life. Give her a break, and respect the fact that she has the confidence to take that up, cos yeah, PhD is no joke. There will come a point when she would happily devote herself to her family, and balance it out with her work life. Her degrees, or lack of them, won't make any difference. Let her study while she wants to, okay?
3. Just because she is 27 and unmarried does not mean she's been rejected by many men. Maybe, being single is a choice she has made.
4. Having a boyfriend does not make her characterless.
5. Just because she has recently gone through a break up doesn't mean she is vulnerable and available.
6. Just because most of her friends are boys, does not mean she is ""having a good time"" with all of them.
7. Just because she has a drink in her hand does not mean she is an alcoholic.
8. Just because she wore a short skirt to one party does not mean she dresses up that way every day.
9. Just because she is ambitious doesn't mean she isn't a family person.
10. Just because she doesn't discuss her plans doesn't mean she's clueless about life. Give her a chance, alright?
11. Just because she is outspoken doesn't mean she is a rebel.
12. Just because she comes home late from work does not mean she is sleeping around with her colleagues.
13. After a hectic week, give her some time to relax over the weekend. Don't make that one weekend party make her look like a she's a frivolous party-girl without a job.
14. Just because she is out shopping alone does not mean she is depressed or lonely. It's how she relaxes, respect that.
15. Just because she is on a holiday alone does not mean she doesn't have company. Maybe it's a break to get back her lost confidence, or maybe that's how she is. Admire her spirit instead of giving her advice, okay?
16. Just because she is a woman doesn't mean she can't kick ass in military school.
17. Just because she has a tattoo doesn't mean she is attention seeking. Maybe that's her way of expression.
18. Just because she doesn't know how to cook doesn't mean she won't make a good wife. Remember when you were just married and cooked chicken curry which was um, a disaster?
19. Just because she likes everything pink and shiny and fluffy doesn't mean she lives in her own world. She can handle some situations much better than her male counterparts.
20. Just because she is pretty does not mean she is a whore. And just because she is friendly does not mean she is flirting with you.
21. Just because she has a short hair, doesn't mean she's not interested in man. Everyone has their own taste on styling, and that is her; short hair and boyish style. Let her express herself. Don't judge her sexuality based on how she dress. Please !(credit to Cornelia M Asinti)
Yes, we cry, we are emotional; we take things personally, and sometimes over-react to situations. But this does not give any one the right to judge us in the wrong way. Times are changing; don't confine her within those boundaries, no matter how orthodox you are. There are some who might be fighting this losing battle, yet compromising on their decisions and plans, just to please society.

56945,99272,"Seeking advise to help for my husband
I am a 33 years old working mum of 2 son, 4 and 2 years old. My husband is 30 this year but he is very lazy.
I met my husband through a common friend 5 years back when he just returned from studies in the UK. We hit off pretty well as he's witty and humorous plus he secured a very good career in an MNC company and decent family. I'm comfortable with him taking the lead and planning for everything so I usually don't have any inputs for his decision despite him always asking me for it.
I got my legs swept off by him and agreed to marry him after 1.5 years of relationship. But things start to change much after marriage. He became very lazy whenever I asked him to do stuffs. Like when I asked him many times to get a driving license, he said that he never actually needed one as he has someone to chauffeur him around and taking PHV or cab is cheaper than owning a car in Singapore unlike UK. I was pretty upset when he said that as a car would be convenient for checkups for my gynae visits and meeting up with my friends.
He does not help out much in housework except for washing of clothes, windows cleaning and fans as there are much more things to do apart from these. He will usually lounge around or sneak off to go for exercise once he is completed with those chores while I need to look after the kids. I told him there are many other chores to do but he always said that he will do later but never did.
His working hours are pretty hectic as he will usually reached office by 8.30am and will only reached home by 8pm. As I finished work earlier, I will usually picked up my kids from childcare and buy dinner, which is quite tiring when my cab doesn't arrived on time or when the food delivery doesn't come early and need to tend to hungry kids. Travelling can be pretty tiring even via taxis. I always tell him to cab home but he likes to travel by MRT as it helps to save cost. Cabbing home can reduce an hr of travelling time which he can help me to tend to kids when i'm tired and he's earning a high 6 digit figure per annual, I can't figure out why he is so petty on money when I'm only earning 1/3 of his salary. Although he pays for all the cab rides and food but I just want him to share the load of actual parenting. I felt so overwhelm by the fatigue that I actually quit my job to take care of the kids when my 2nd kid was born. I told my husband that he should spent more time to take care of the household but he often use work or a need to exercise as an excuse. I don't understand why he needs to choose timing to go for exercise. For weekdays, he has free time from 11pm onwards, but he can choose to go straight after work. For weekends, it's even worse, he can opt for timing like 1 to 3pm where the kids are usually sleeping or 10pm onwards but he choose timing like 6am in the morning or 5pm in the evening when the kids are awake or going to be awake.
Things start to have a strange turn of events when he mentioned that he wants to quit his job and spend time. I felt very happy and relieve when he said that. But the downside is that, he told me that I may have to look for a job as he could have difficulty finding a job that has work life balance and decent salary. I was happy and disappointed at the same time, but I guess that's life. So I agreed and he quit his job and he's taking care of the kids at home while I went back to the workforce after 2 years of being a housewife. Things are doing great for me as the workplace is good and the pay is much higher than my previous job, but not for my husband. He has difficulty finding a manager entry level job as he is over qualified, having armed with an Imperial College degree and INSEAD MBA, he has difficulty finding a job that support work life balance and decent salary when he is willing to take up to a 75% pay cut. Despite being at home, I find that the status of the house cleanlines is not up to my standard when I can find small peck of dust on the window grill when I do my spot check and he still has the tired feel when he doesn't even need to work. I don't understand why can't he take care of the house when I'm earning the dough. When confronted, he said that he is making pretty good money while being a day trader and suggested that we should get a maid to do the menial work while both of us earn the money but I don't like strangers to stay with us. I also urged him to be more active on job hunting as we have expenses to pay for. I need his contributions for my parent housing loan and our utility and my cab expenses. Luckily our 5 room is fully paid thanks to his investment. He's pretty lazy as his day trading can fetch about 5k for good months and 3k for bad month and has a emergency savings for 10 years without working, but it can be embarrasing for a guy to be unemployed for long time.
I asked my friends for advise but their responds are pretty mixed and I'm also dried up for solutions, which is why I would like to sought for more options to get my husband to help out more.

56336,97480,"Singaporeans, a majority of only worry about career and money and relationships the latter usually ignored.
I graduated with a law degree overseas ten years ago, aged 31.
I married a woman whom I loved a lot.
At this time, I was living in a bungalow that my wife and I bought, I had a lucrative business on the side which I had sold a majority of.
I secured a job at a law firm and after a year or so of 80-hour work weeks,
I then secured a job as a counsel to a large MNC based in Europe.
On a 2-year contract
I left sg chasing a $1,200,000 a month job I was working 19 hours a day. I never replied to my parents calls nor my wife’s.
I missed the birth of my son who died shortly after he was born.
I didn't come back; I had no choice our firm was in the middle of a crisis.
And I dare not face my family.
To cover my grief, I kept working, I slept in the office and also sold off all my shares worth about $30,000,000 for $1 in the same I stared to my best friend, as she was the one I trusted the most to lead the firm also I had no interest in anything.
After I had settled all the issues at work, I ended the contract and had to pay some money for ending it early, I also had to help find a replacement.
I flew back the same day I handed in my letter to the firm.
When I came home, I found a letter from my wife, she had left me, we then got a divorce.
I did all this for my family they had a good life in my opinion.
I sent my parents for holidays almost every month, I sent about.
50% of my income back to them.
The remaining would usually be sent to charities.
I paid of my sibling’s medical school fees too.
And the rest to my wife, she got to live as a tai tai, over the years she spent almost $1,200,000 just on cars and Designer stuff.
These are things I had no interest in but in my mind, I believed they kept my family happy.
But no, I lost my family too.
who moved overseas, they rarely spoke to me?
I chased money the almost all the Cs except country club (totally hate most people there)
All for my family, I think I never spent more than a day with them those few years.
2 years ago, I found out form my in laws my wife had died (I will not specify how) but it was a dagger trough my heart, as I had intended to rekindle our love.
I then wandered about for a year ...
I have fixed my relationship with my parents who are now in their 70s, they are volunteer teachers, and they spend their time teaching students and helping build schools overseas, they had sold their own home to do this.
I let go of everything 30% my money I put in a trust that will be used for charitable causes after I die 20%, I put aside for my SME that I founded to use, if I times of crisis.
The remaining 50% I gave it away, I also gave away all the proceeds firm the sale of all my cars and homes and investments.
I happy now, I help with my parents. And I work as a pro bono lawyer too.
I still cry every night hoping I was not that rich that way my child may not have died.
And my wife would be still with me.
All the material stuff did not bring me any happiness, only for a second. After that no... just sadness
What's worse is that I lost many good friends, and I didn't know and couldn't tell who my friends are back then.
Please my fellow Singaporeans success
Is best earned and achieved when you find true happiness and you have done your level best to contribute to society and made a positive difference in people’s lives.
That will bring you much more happiness. Then any amount of money will.
There is so much more to see and to do, let us not be blinded and distracted.
by monetary and material gains
Instead, please focus on your family, your children’s parents and passions you want to peruse.
I hope we can start to value people better rather than who earns the most. or who has a degree or what not.
I will give an example.
In Singapore we see a Mercedes-Benz, oh wow we go that person must have lots of $$ and likely is successful.
In Germany, people see a Mercedes-Benz, “oh look that's my taxi.""
regards,
A Singaporean who spent 40 years chasing something that truly does not bring value.

55240,94779,"I married my bf of 6 years and got our key to our BTO early last year. After living with my bf for the past few months in our new flat, I realized our living habits are DRASTICALLY different in so many unthinkable ways. This has taken a toll on my mental health as I struggle to adapt to his living habits.
For example, he doesn’t shower and brush his teeth before going to bed and I’m quite disgusted by it. I’ve told him countless times that showering and brushing of teeth before sleep is what we should do (because who wants to kiss, cuddle and have sex with your stinky husband in bed right, especially when he had a long day at work). He told me he has been doing this since young and it is just a habit he has. He only shower and brush his teeth in the morning or before going out. After he showers, he won’t be able to sleep until after a few hours later. I know I shouldn’t be so selfish as to judge him, but I’d rather not sleep on a bed knowing it is filled with his own sweat and dirt (he don’t wash his feet after work either) he accumulated throughout the day, and disrupt my sleep.
Another example is that whenever my husband goes to the washroom to pee, he just urinates WITHOUT LIFTING THE TOILET SEAT and the whole seat will be filled with droplets of his own pee. I know it is hard to control your own stream, but please, for goodness’s sake, DO NOT urinate as though you’re only living alone by yourself. I have to always use wet wipes to clean the toilet seat before I can do my own business. When I tell him this, he told me to LIVE WITH IT or GET USED TO IT?!?
Also, whenever we have dinner at home, he does not help to do the dishes at all. I know he’s tired from work but so am I? Even though I end work slightly earlier (4pm) than him (6pm), I have to rush home to make dinner for us on days we don’t eat out. After eating his dinner, he will just go to the kitchen skin to wash his mouth and proceed to jump into bed while leaving the dishes and food waste on the table untouched. I don’t mind doing the dishes if he at least helps a bit like throwing the food waste away and bringing the dishes to the sink. When I tell him that, he says he’s tired and it’s just simple task to me??? HELLO?
Those are just a few examples from a list of MANY. We have not really lived together for long periods as it is usually sleepovers. And when we travel together in the past, those issues do not matter because there is always room service in hotel and travelling usually last a couple of days and not all habits are shown unlike when you live together for the rest of your life, aka, DECADES.
I’ve started to regret marrying my husband. I do love him, but I can’t imagine living with this guy for the rest of my life when he does not want to engage in any form of compromise or take any effort to change his living habits. I’m afraid more issues will surface if we ever have kids in the future. Please, guys and girls, do not get married before living together for at least a few weeks to see if you guys are compatible. Your home is supposed to be your sanctuary, not another place you dread going to after work. I know these are minor issues but it’s these small little things that matter a whole lot.

I was at Bishan Junction 8 pet lover's today, 15/04/2021 at 7:28pm. My friend and I went into the store to get some hamster treats. When i first went into the the store, there was already a chinese lady who was with her son talking to 2 of the staff working there. There was also another indian lady at the payment counter. My friend and i didnt think much, we were just looking at the pets and then we started hearing this lady shouting. The chinese lady turned out to be a freaking KAREN LOL.
KAREN kept shouting at the staff and shouted things like-
""I'm very disappointed in you""
""You will have to pay for it, you're responsible""
""I will complain about you""
""We are very sincere YOU KNOW""
"" I CALLED YOU AT 12PM TO TELL YOU WE WILL BE COMING DOWN TONIGHT""
""THEY HAVE PIANO LESSONS YOU KNOW""
( referring to her son and her daughter who was with her husband which both of them were not there at that point of time )
"" DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COME HERE FROM EAST COAST???1111?1!11?1?1?1?11!!""
"" DONT SAY SORRY TO ME SAY SORRY TO HIM""
"" THEY CAME HERE WITHOUT EATING DINNER YOU KNOW?!?!??????!?""
THIS karen was shouting and saying that she came in yesterday but because the store was closing, they couldnt make up their mind if they want this freaking rabbit, so they said they will come back today.
I didn't get the any of the staff's name but the staff who talked to this KAREN on the phone told her the Pet lover's policy is that they are not allowed to reserve pets just by using words over the phone( they said the call was made at about 12pm ). common sense ?? no ?? no guarantee no nothing, just words? The indian lady also called up the store to give them a heads up, the staff also said that she also told the indian lady the same
policy and there is also another customer who is interested in getting the rabbit.
The Indian lady was there first and already bought the necessities for her new pet rabbit, like cage and whatever not. When she paid for everything, Karen went into the stall and found out that the rabbit was already sold. KAREN was obviously unhappy and started shouting those things above. She also raised her voiced at the staff asking
"" WHO IS IT ?!? WHO YOU SELL IT TO ?!? ""
and the staff pointed to the indian lady beside her son LOL this KAREN dare not shout at the Indian lady so she took it out on the poor staff ????
The staff again, tried explain to KAREN why the rabbit was sold, and kept apologising. KAREN BEING KAREN obviously shouted even louder and louder infront of her son. So Karen called her husband down LOLOL typical Karen move.
JUST SAYING, the husband did nothing at all and he kept quiet the whole entire time. So the more Karen couldnt get the cute rabbit, she kept asking her husband to do something about it.
So KAREN and family was blocking the entrance, the staff who was being shouted at started tearing up but quickly wiped away her tears and went out behind them to welcome other customers in. Karen wasnt done so she stepped back and continue barking at the staff. The second staff went to call the supervisor and tried explaining the situation but also broke down. The supervisor told the staff to call security and then security came down.
When 2 of the security came down, they asked the safe entry staff ( because he was the one who called them ) what happened and he just pointed to all of us. I pointed at KAREN. When Karen saw the 2 security officer, she asked them 'What's the problem?? can you solve this for us? no? I'm dealing this with her!1!1?!?!?1!1!"" and the staff didnt want to trouble them so she told them it's ok. So basically the security guards just stood beside Karen's family and did nothing but kept quiet the entire time LOL thanks
The staff apologised again and said that she understand that she's very angry and it's her fault. but KAREN pointed to her children and told the staff - ""DONT SAY SORRY TO ME!1!1!1!11!!11!!!!!!! SAY SORRY TO THEM""
The staff didnt hesitate a single bit and step forward and apologised to KAREN DNA kids. LMAO the entire time when KAREN was inside the store with her son, he was just staring into blank space. Suddenly he 'cried' when the staff apologised and went behind KAREN. At this point, I told my friend about it and he stepped forward. He told KAREN to not raise her voice and to not shout anymore because there were many passerby who stopped and stare. It must have been really embarrassing for the staff what??? Karen not happy so she told my friend -
""Keep quiet, I'm having a conversation with her""
My friend fired back saying, "" No you're not, you're shouting at her and she dont have to deal with your attitude"" KAREN'S PRIDE MUST HAVE BEEN HURT at this point, and she asked my friend "" WHAT ATTITUDE?!1?1?1! ""
My friend then told the staff-
""just go in, you dont have to deal with her attitude""
He then looked at Karen and told her
"" if you're unhappy, you can just call the police.""
Then at Karen's husband
"" Please control your wife ""
KAREN'S HUSBAND kept tapping her arm said let's go. NO USE LORRRR.
AND SHE OBV DIDNT CALL the police la cause she knew she was out of line
I pulled the staff back into the store and she kept telling me she was okay and it was her fault. Then i told KAREN she was abusing the staff, she's so crazy in the head she can ask me how is she doing that. HER daughter who is about like p3/4, said to me "" but we already called about the rabbit "" lmao and i answered, didnt the staff already tell
you about their policy ???
I told her she have been shouting and raising her voice for 30minutes.
"" ARE YOU SURE 30MINS ?!??!?!?! ""
"" urm yes ???? ""
and then she kept quiet LOL and then she ask me to SHUT UP
so i was already very frustrated at how self entitled she is, i shouted back at her.
i told her to stfu and shes a f*cking b*tch, i know it was unnecessary but she really went out of line by shouting at the staff NON STOP. demoralising the staff by saying she's irresponsible and unreasonable. telling the staff she will pay for it
blah blah nonsense ????? this my first every time witnessing a karen. SHOUTING and fighting over a freaking rabbit. Then her daughter suddenly went from like omg we called about the rabbit to ma im sorry we dont want the rabbit anymore.
One of the secuirty uncle looked at me and signaled me to keep quiet and not say anything. LOL OK THANK YOU COMING DOWN you can go back up and secure this mall. please restrict all karens next time thank you ????
SO karen gave up after she was being fired back at
and started walking away and mubling to herself.
HOW is she not embarrassed for acting so rowdy and disgusting in public over a freaking rabbit???? Even when the staff cried infront of her, she have no freaking remorse or whatsoever LOL
I hope pet lover's do not believe the shit this KAREN says LMAO

56604,98380,"Why are people such hypocrites when it comes to killing animals for food nowadays?
I fish as a hobby and I eat the majority of what I fish, so I have no issues with killing animals with the intent of eating them.
Few days back, I invited 3 friends to my apartment and I told them I'd be preparing chilli crab for them. They were so excited over the food and one even said it's her favourite dish. I bought 4 live sri lankan crabs home and waited for my friends to arrive before processing them because I wanted to keep the food fresh.
When my friends came, they were shocked that I bought live crabs. I told them it's for freshness. The friend who said chilli crab was her favourite dish started arguing with me, calling me a murderer.
I told her to look away and proceeded to kill the crabs swiftly with a knife up the bottom and she started crying. My other friends were split, with one supporting her and saying I'm a monster, while the other said I am just doing what every restaurant does.
I called her a hypocrite for eating crabs at a restaurant even though she can't stand the crabs being killed, and she couldn't come out with a proper reply. Needless to say the gathering sucked and she ran home crying with one other friend. This left the 2 of us to eat 4 crabs and it was absolutely delicious.
Animal cruelty starts at the dinner table and I admit I am cruel to animals for the sake of food. But at least I'm no hypocrite.

56734,98723,"Hi,
I'm just a girl enrolled in a business degree and like many of us, I hope to land myself a job in a BB bank after graduation. I consider myself attractive, but I never thought of dating at this point.
However, things changed, dad's business got impacted by the dreaded COVID and affected things financially at home. I felt down.
Somehow, I got closer to a guy friend as he tried hard to lift my spirits. He wasn't my type at all, a ME in the airforce and I wouldn't consider him good looking. We got together somehow...
I'm reconsidering our relationship because I really don't see myself spending the rest of my life with him. I admit to having pinkerton syndrome, I get attracted easily to ang mos with a good sense of humour
However, my bf tried to please me by buying a car
With his income, I didn't expect much, maybe a cute little VW would be nice. Then came the shock when I first saw the car as he drove into campus
It was a old lousy looking honda, I don't even know what model it was and I felt embarrassed as my friends stared at us. I dreaded boarding the car.
My bf saw my disappointment and tried to explain. He told me this car is called EGG or EG6, honestly I have no idea what it is. All I know was that it looked extremely banged up.
He told me to not be deceived by its outlook because it has vtec and wanted to show me what it was. I don't know what he did and suddenly he told me vtec has kicked in.
Wow! The experience was amazing...I actually got wet...
VTEC is the best, now I know he really wants the best for me :)

For example, when he watches football on the couch and doesn't realize I am doing work on the table behind, he will slide his hand underneath his shorts and scratch his private parts, before bringing said hand up to his nose and taking a deep, invigorating breath, as if one were doing meditation.
Other times, the scratching results in some dirt that he rubs between his thumb and forefinger into a little grey ball of death, which he EATS. Lastly, sometimes the scratching dislodges a strand of pubic hair, which he examines with keen interest in the same way David Attenborough looks at insects on plants, before sucking on it.
I have gone down on him many times and I can assure yall that it is not Bengawan Solo down there. So why is he smelling, eating and sucking on by-products of his nether region? Do all guys do these?? How do yall cope with this disgusting side of your husbands/bfs???

We had dinner at a french restaurant and after desserts I told her I need to use the toilet urgently but actually it was just an excuse to leave the restaurant. After telling her I need to go toilet, I stepped out of the restaurant and immediately went back home.
I know it was not very nice of me to leave but at least when I reach home, I texted her that I won’t be going back to the restaurant due to urgent matters at home and I also thanked her for footing the bill. Fortunately, the restaurant was quite affordable so the meal probably only costed $80+?
Tbh I feel bad that she had to pay for the meal but then again, she catfished me so I am the real victim!! Anyway, I already wasted so much time on going out with her so it would be ridiculous to even pay for the meal. Somemore she was so dishonest so she should pay the price for being so shady? Lol
Guys, be very careful of girls you meet on dating apps. Do some background check and ask them to video call before meeting up. Some girls really shady af.

What would you do if you were me?
Examples:
When I asked for a valentine's date at the USS, he told me to go there some other time because of the crowd. His reason is that Valentine's Day is a ""corporate trick"" to make us spend more on things we don't need and that day doesn't have any significance.
When I asked him what ring he is going to buy for me when we get married, he started talking about how the price of diamonds is artificially inflated through a monopoly and started talking about the history of marketing of diamonds.
When I asked him when he wants to get married, he said that marriage is a social construct (?!?!) and that we should get married only when we feel stable enough to BTO.

56789,98889,"I am a 27 (F) working in the town area. I would rate myself decent-looking and have had several ex-es who looks pretty good. A month back my company hired a new colleague who is 28 (M). My first impression towards him based on his appearances weren’t very good to be honest. He is not very tall (16-ish), nerdy-looking with an outdated hairstyle. He always goes out to lunch alone, probably because he’s shy and have not blended in yet. I tried my best to avoid him around work (I felt so guilty right now about that) but because of work-related issues, I can’t avoid him completely. There were times he consulted me and I had to teach him.
Only just very recently, out of total coincidence, I found out his daily routine during our lunch break and after work. There will always be an old aunty selling tissues in a corner during lunch break and she always almost get ignored by the passer-bys, but this colleague of mine, he always gets her a cup of coffee/hot milo and buys her tissue packs at an overpaid price. I saw this while I was behind him heading to the same place for lunch. He would even tell the aunty he will be back later after work to see her. I was astonished. I later found out he literally does that everyday he is in the office. The packs of tissues purchased are now all stacked up neatly in his drawer.
There was also another incident at work whereby he got reprimanded for doing the wrong things. I soon realised what he did were actually all instructed and taught by me. I thought he would tell on me but he just kept quiet throughout the entire lecture. When he came out, I hurriedly went over to apologise and all he said was, ‘it’s okay’ and gave me a wide smile. That was one of the brightest and genuine smile I have seen in my entire life. I feel that I have developed feelings for him although his appearances is entirely not my type. I feel that I can actually bypass all these judgemental impressions of mine of a person because of his character for the first time in my life.
Please tell me how do I make my feelings known for him in a subtle way? I don’t think he has much confidence in himself and would definitely not be the one to initiate or confess. For the rest of the ladies out there, please take my heed. Looks are only temporal. What stays is the heart and mind. His heart is greater than everyone’s else.

55272,94862,"TL;DR - My girlfriend found out that I have been purposely hiding her from my family. Now she’s upset and wants to break up with me. What should I do?
I have been with my girlfriend for 7 years since uni year 1. I’m 28, she’s 32. Things have been going smoothly until she found out that I have been purposely hiding her from my family and relatives.
When we first started dating, she would post photos of us on Facebook and even tag me in those photos. Back then, I had no intention to commit to her and thus, I didn’t want my family and relatives to see those photos. When she was asleep, I secretly took her phone and logged into her Facebook account and blocked my family and relatives from her account, so that my family and relatives won’t be able to see her profile and thus won’t know that she exists.
When she asked me if my family have FB accounts, I lied to her that they don’t have FB account. When she wanted to come over my house, I lied to her that my family are staying overseas, I’m renting a room in a small flat, my landlords don’t allow visitors. When she asked me why I never go find my family, I lied that I cut them out of my life as they are very toxic.
Two months ago, she suddenly asked me if I would like to buy a resale flat with her and settle down. I told her I’m busy with work and would prefer to discuss this another day. She also started asking me if I would like to meet her family but I always come up with excuses like I’m too busy with work.
She’s been saying how she would like to get married soon but tbh I have no intention to settle down because of various reasons. Firstly, we don’t earn much. She earns 3k and I earn 6k. I don’t think we can afford mortgage, car and kids comfortably. Secondly, she’s not wife-material. She likes to cook but her cooking skills is quite average and she rarely does household chores, usually only once a week.
Since I don’t have the intention to settle down, I don’t see the need to introduce her to my family. Moreover, I think my parents won’t even like her because she’s poorly educated as she’s just a diploma holder and she doesn’t look very presentable as she doesn’t wear makeup and has poor fashion sense.
After she accidentally found out about the list of blocked people on her FB account, she unblocked all of them and found out that my family and relatives are all staying in SG and not overseas. She accused me of betraying her trust in me. She also accused me of looking down on her because she thinks I’m ashamed of her and thus want to hide her from my family. But I’ve never felt ashamed of her. I truly love her as she’s my biggest supporter.
After she found out the truth, she got really upset and now she even wants to break up with me. I feel so disappointed that she is willing to throw away our relationship just because of such trivial matter. Seriously I don’t even know why she need to overreact. What I can do to win her back? I really need her in my life.

55316,94971,"In regards to #94924, hi I’m that rude and arrogant blind date. Yes, it sadly (for me) wasn’t a troll post.
I’m gonna ignore the 2/10 rating but thank you for rating me a 9/10, I really appreciate it. Working towards a 10/10 as we speak ????.
Likewise, the moment you opened your stupid fat mouth, you became a 2/10 too.
Also I would just like to let people know that it was your mum who approached mine asking if I would be willing to go on a blind date with you. I honestly didn’t even want to go nor waste my time and money in the first place.
Now let’s start spilling the actual tea ya.
Point 1. Thank you for pointing out my youthful and young looks. Not sure how you interpreted my awkward smile to compliments as a “hard stare” but no, I didn’t stare at you. I literally smiled. Stop making shit up luv.
Point 2. Ah yes, I did rudely stare at you for this. Yes, it’s a male-dominated industry, but I’ve not let gender get in the way of what I love to study and hopefully do in the future. Next time close both eyes and not say anything about it.
Point 3. Honestly at this point I was getting pretty annoyed and fed up. Am I really just supposed to sit there and accept that sexist comment?? Lmao absolutely not.
Point 4. How the fuck am I an overachiever for taking a double degree so that I’m able to get a well-paying job in the future? Men don’t like overachievers? Nah, I think it’s boys like you who can’t stand independent women that can provide for themselves because you feel insecure and inferior that a woman is earning more than you.
Point 5. Awww your small cock energy is showing here ????. You got free lunch even after giving me shitty advice that I didn’t ask for and for pointing out that I’m a 9/10 on the internet as an anonymous coward just because I’m not skinny enough for your standards, while I wasted $25-30. Should I invoice you for your half of the fucking meal?
I too hope to never cross paths with you ever again as well. I hope your already small dick shrinks up every single time you think about our stupid date.
From your post, it is also very clear how you have never lifted a finger to do a single chore in your entire pathetic existence. Stating how I can’t cook, clean, or look after my future spouse just because I don’t want to be a housewife, it’s clear you want one just so you won’t have to do anything at home. If you expect your wife to set up a whole ass meal, scoop your food, do all the chores in the house and take care of you, either get a maid or live under your mum’s armpit for the rest of your life.
My attitude mirrors yours. If mine was terrible then imagine how yours was that I couldn’t even continue to sit through the shitty date any longer than I have to.
I don’t feel like an asshole for leaving you honestly. Your mum called mine to say that I was rude for leaving you by the way. I guess it’s only fair that my dad calls yours to make sure he knows of his son’s misogynistic and shitty behaviour.
Good luck to whoever the fuck is crazy enough to date or marry you. I’d like to be a partner, not a maid or nanny for an overgrown man child. ????

55359,95052,"Hi guys, I would like to please appeal to the public TO PLEASE GIVE WAY TO AMBULANCES.
I used to work as a paramedic in the army, and now I’m working as a junior doctor. I am mentioning my credentials because I hope to appeal to the public by giving yall a real recount of what happens behind the scenes.
Recently on the news, there was an article of an ambulance crashing into a car at Tuas (with the siren on), and it is really disheartening to see the Facebook comments section filled with “ambulance then can anyhow drive?” or many personal recounts of how ambulances drive recklessly on the road. Sure, there may be SOME instances of ambulances abusing their power, but why is the heck is that our first reaction to such news? Then again, even though I do fully understand that Fb comments are not the thoughts of majority, I would like to appeal to us young ones to do the right thing (if we are not already doing so)
When I was a paramedic, I saw deaths on a weekly basis. When I worked at the emergency department as a junior doctor, I saw deaths on a daily basis. The scene of family members crying and being in denial over the news of death is not something that anyone can ever get used to. It is heart wrenching, and for me to see those comments by fellow citizens really irks me. When the siren in the ambulances are switched on, the patient is in CRITICAL CONDITION, and every SECOND that he/she arrives at the emergency will lead to a much better prognosis.
So what if the ambulance is driving recklessly? Do you think the ambulance driver likes to drive like that for fun? I have sat in an ambulance for 1.5 years during my army days, and I can safely tell you that no one, absolutely no driver, will do that for fun. We all have families to go back home to, we all have a responsibility to be safe on the roads as well, but more importantly, we owe the patients a duty of care that they deserve. And if ensuring the patient goes to the hospital earlier and survives, rest be assured the driver is going to be more “reckless” (for the lack of a better word).
Dear young readers who are reading this, if your reaction to an ambulance getting into an accident is “what a reckless driver”, or “red light how I give way why the ambulance horn me” then you should really change your mindset. If your car is stopped in front of an ambulance in front of a red light, you can always move your car in front of the stop line, go ahead of the first car in the other lanes, and let the ambulance pass you. Nobody is asking you to run a red light, or to try and predict what an ambulance does on the road. All I’m asking for is more empathy, empathy for the patient that is suffering in the ambulance, empathy for the patient’s family who are in worried sick, and empathy for the driver who is trying his absolute best to reach his destination.
We are a first world country, but in terms of our civic mindedness, we are still far from it. Please do consider my open appeal to all you readers. The patient in the ambulance could be your loved ones one day. Thank you all for reading till the end!

57426,100814,"Do you ever think about your ex partner and wonder how they're doing?
For the record, I'm happily married, with a beautiful baby girl. My husband is loving, everything I could have ever wished for. My life is complete, beyond my dreams and I'm really grateful..
But today, while putting my baby girl to sleep, I suddenly realized that it must have been roughly 10 years since my first boyfriend had broken up with me. (My husband is my second)
I started to wonder how this first guy is. Not in a romantic kind of way but genuine concern as someone who had known him very well in the past.
You see, he's not a bad guy. At all. He just has all the bad luck. And I do wonder how he is from time to time, though I've no desire to get in contact. I genuinely hope things have looked up for him since.
The circumstances of our breakup was dramatic, though it was none of our fault. He's just plain unlucky.
We had been together about 5 years, throughout university, but he broke up with me the first year after we graduated and started working.
The following can probably be written into a mediacorp drama:
His family had always been fraught with problems. They're a working class family, with total of 4 brothers. He is no. 2. They could have had a good, middle class life but his father gambled to the point of having loanshark come to the house and to the office, causing him to lose his job.
Then his parents divorced, selling the flat to split assets. His father then became homeless, and my then boyfriend who was still in uni, had to fork out few hundreds a month from his part time tuition income to rent a bed for his dad.
I pitied him having to support his dad while the rest of his family moved to a HDB rental flat. By this time the other brothers had stopped contact with his dad, only my ex boyfriend was supporting him.
Wanting to save on university fees, he deliberately loaded on more modules so he could graduate a semester earlier and go to work to earn money to support his dad and family, with 2 younger brothers who were still schooling.
The last straw came one day when I was at work. By that time I had just started working a few months, so he could have been working for a year already.
I still remember I received a text from him, asking to meet me that night after work. I had period cramps and really wanted to go home to rest so I asked if we could meet another night. But no, he had something urgent to tell me. So we met at my void deck.
I still remember that night. He sat me down and told me everything...
He wanted to break up with me. Because his youngest brother, then in sec 3, had been kicked out of school for failing to turn up for the retake of his end of year exam. Yes, so he had failed once and had been retained. The school gave him another chance to come back for re-exam but in between, he had gone to lion dance, fallen and broken his collar bone, meaning he couldn't take the re exam since he couldn't write. So the school had called to kick him out. That was the last straw for my ex bf as his problems seemed unending and which led to his decision to break up with me.
Incredulous? The whole situation was incredulous to me. I cried and cried and cried. I didn't understand why it was me who had to suffer a break up when we both agreed I wasn't a problem to him.
He then told me everything else. He said he didn't want to burden me with all his family's problems so he had kept alot of the severity of the problems to himself.
But during the break up, he came clean and told me everything that had been plaguing him.
By that time, I hadn't seen his eldest brother for months. I did ask, but my then bf just made excuses. Only during the break up did he tell me that his elder brother had been caught taking drugs and had been either in jail or rehab (I can't rmb). I was shocked and so pained for him. This meant that he could no longer continue to work in insurance after his release, and the burden on my ex bf to support the family became even heavier.
He also told me, when his parents divorced and sold the flat, they split proceeds, and his dad went uncontactable for a week, apparently he had gone to Batam to gamble and came back after he lost heavily or most of it.
So yeap up until that point, I had been blissfully unaware of the severity of his family's problems and only knew that they divorced due to his gambling problem and that only my ex bf was supporting his dad by renting a bed space for him to stay.
I was stunned. And sad. We had talked about BTO, visited the show flat, discussed applying for the one at AMK etc. Everybody including me, thought we would end up together because that's just how we were.
And then as I sat crying and wailing, he told me he decided to break up with me because I was always a happy girl and he didn't want to burden me with his problems. So he didn't tell me alot of these things that plagued him. But when he had to meet me, he had to put up a happy front and he didn't want to anymore.
I was bewildered because yes im sheltered, but I'm not unhelpful or uncaring. I didn't understand why he had to hide his problems from me.
When his dad was homeless, I even suggested he move in with my own dad so as to save on rent.
My parents were and are separated, my dad stays alone in a house. So there was room for his dad. He did move in, but my dad is not easy-going. He has OCD and is very x100 naggy. So anyway, things didn't work out between the dads and his dad had a fall in the house and was warded and later diagnosed with kidney failure and needed dialysis.
Anyway so we broke up that night but I was distraught and kept pestering him, stalking him at his house and workplace to force him to speak to me. I even contemplated jumping off his block, while sitting on the stairs in between knocking on his door for him to speak to me.
Eventually he told me, please stop knocking on my door. I feel very stressed, it reminds me of times when the loanshark came to our house.
It took me more than a year, and a few months of severe pimple outbreak before I got over the heartbreak. I had pimple outbreak from excessively crying, it dried out my face or caused some hormonal changes and at age 25, I had my first outbreak.
My turning point came when I was overseas with a group of girl friends doing community work. After activities one day, they took us out fishing for lala in the river. It was evening time. As I floated lazily down the river, I looked up and suddenly saw that the sky was round. I can't put it in words, but the sky was so vast and clear.. clouds dotted the sky. I could see it was indeed round. And I thought to myself: The world is so big, there's still so many things I haven't seen and done, so many things waiting for me..
In that moment, I was filled with hope and excitement for the future and stopped looking back on my past. It took another few months for my pimples to die down.. I discovered the vegetarian diet helped calm my hormones and pimples down.
My healing really came after this river trip. I started doing alot of things on my own, like cycling from ECP to Changi Point or Barrage every weekend. Going to swim 20 laps. All on my own. It was very empowering because I had never been a very independent person.
And then about a year after the break up, my colleagues encouraged me to start dating again. They told me about online dating. Actually my director was the one who told me about it. That's where he met his wife. So I did, and then I met my future husband. We dated for 2 years and have been married for 5 years now.
Anyway, I am just writing to put this on the internet, and putting it out there that I hope this first guy is well and found someone he deserves. I hope things have gone better for him and his family and I sincerely wish them the very best. I keep him in my thoughts quite frequently, like once every few months I would wonder if he's ok.
I mean, after all he has been through, I hope god is treating him better now.
Oh, actually we did meet about 2 years after the breakup. Purely by coincidence. My grandma had been warded in hospital and so was his dad. My cousins bumped into him and told him about grandma, who he also knew. So he messaged me after that to ask her condition. That's the first time we spoke after so long, I was already dating my husband. Anyway long story short, his dad passed away from kidney failure shortly after and I also visited his funeral. I felt really guilty at that time because I had blamed our breakup on his dad too. Anyway that was the last time we spoke.
End of story, it was long.

Firstly let’s be real, you are there for the money so just own it. Next, just to clarify I really respect some friends who are working in this industry because it really is hard work. However, some people really make me sick because I’ve seen how they were like back in school. They were some of the most irresponsible and lazy people around who can’t even be punctual for important things, yet now they are suddenly the most responsible hustler trying to sell you an expensive insurance package or a house. Erm seriously, even if I were desperate, I probably wouldn’t trust you with my money given how two face you are.

55128,94497,"I cheated.
After entering my new work place for 6 months, I could hit it off really well with my colleague girl A and we started hanging out even after work. I was selfish, I wanted the best of both worlds, I didn't tell her that I am currently attached. We started going on dates and I was cheating emotionally. I had to find ways to hide it from my current girlfriend. After 3 months when things are getting serious, I cheated physically. Day after day , my guilt is over consuming me, it wasn't fair for the both of them and I couldn't bring myself to tell either one the truth. My long time girlfriend thought that I'm always busy at work so that I couldn't meet her and she was very understanding, encouraging me along the way while in actual fact I was spending my day away at girl A's house.
Fast forward to last December when I couldn't take the guilt anymore and decided to end things with Girl A, she found out about my current relationship and threatened to expose it to my girlfriend. I didn't want my gf to find out from a third party so I told her myself.
She was completely broken. She went silent, she didn't ask me why, she didn't ask me what went wrong ,she didn't ask me anything. She just stared into space and sobbed silently. I promised her I will never do it again and seek forgiveness. I completely understand if she wish to leave me but she forgave me and she said she will be better for me.... I felt like shit. It wasn't even her.... the problem was me. She loved me with all her heart yet I took it for granted. She loved me so much that she blamed herself.
After this incident, we continued to live life together and explore new things but I knew things weren't the same. There are nights when I find her crying herself to sleep... I have ruined her perception of love and eroded the trust she has for me.....
Guys out there, before you succumb to the temptation of cheating please think twice. Don't end up like me making a bad decision and destroying your gf's life.

55296,94924,"TL;DR: Rude and arrogant blind date left after I politely gave her advice.
Went on a blind date at the request of my mom and the lady I met up with was arrogant beyond belief. She immediately went from a 9/10 to a 2/10 when I heard her replies.
1. I politely asked her if she's a poly student as she looks quite young. Most women would take that as a compliment seeing how I complimented her on her youthful and young looks. But I was immediately given a hard stare. She told me that she's actually a university student. Fine. Rude but still tolerable.
2. Told me that she is studying events and hope to work in the events industry once she graduates. Hence I told her that it's an industry for men. Which is true as all of my mates in the events industry are all men. But she got very offended by it. And again, rudely stared at me. Nevermind, I close one eye.
3. Asked her why she's taking a double degree when most women end up being a housewife anyways. General question which is also true. She got very offended and rudely insinuated that she won't be one. Again, I paid no mind to her rude stares and arrogance.
4. Gave her a polite advice that men don't like women who are over achievers. Which is true as I believe a lot of women choose to waste time getting a degree to avoid being a housewife. She immediately got up and left in anger which made me angry and embarrassed.
5. Went to pay for the meal but she apparently has paid for the entire bill, which again, made me very feel embarrassed even up till now thinking about it.
Worst date I've been on and hope to never cross paths with her ever again. Are there no women out there who truly want to be housewives? From the way she insinuated that she doesn't want to be one, it's clear that she can't cook, clean or look after her future spouse. Like any other girls with a 9/10 for appearance, she seems to be spoiled, arrogant and ignorant. Would honestly be a 10/10 if she looses a bit of weight. Looks could only get you so far if your attitude is terrible. Therefore she's a 2/10 after embarrassing me.
Hopefully she feels like an asshole for leaving me and making me look like I'm incompetent. Good luck to whoever she dates or marries in the future.

56906,99385,"#99385: This is a question for Prof Ben and also for everyone else with experience in relationships, especially on the financial side of things. Shoutout to Prof Ben as I believe you once mentioned that you leave all your money for your wife to handle?
To give some context, I have been with my gf for 2 years. She is from a quite well-off family the kind who owns around 10 properties. My family is not well off, likely bottom ten percent of Singapore if you consider net worth. Her salary is about 3k a month and mine is around 15k a month. I am one year older than her.
My gf said some things to me last week which I found quite shocking.
Firstly she said she feels like dating a secondary school kid when she is dating me. She said because I often buy basic jewellery and food for her, or bubble tea which is a childish joke. She mentioned her friends' boyfriends buy expensive watches and bags for them and even her parents buy expensive makeup and perfumes for her, so she expect her boyfriend to at least be able to match what her parents can give her because that is her standard. She said instead of giving her small gifts or writing cards to her, she rather I stop being a kid, so immature, grow up and buy her expensive things. She said this is how adults date. Her friends who chose bfs or eventually husbands based on how much money they can give them, are all now very happy.
Secondly, she said she is upset at me for being so poor and earning so little money. I was very surprised to hear this come out of her mouth given that I make five times her salary. She said she feels sorry for me that I cannot spend more money and feel like paying for me so often. But I know she say say only, our expenditure when dating is almost entirely paid for by me. She swipes parents' credit card even when shopping for herself. She said I am very incapable and I should reflect on why my salary is so low. She said she is unsure if she can continue dating such a low income guy like me.
I countered by saying actually on 3k a month, based on her own earning abilities, her lifestyle should be on the more budget end. By saying all these, it means she wants to use my income to upgrade her own lifestyle. I asked her to clarify if this is fact. She then said that is not true, my lifestyle is too budget for her and I need to up my game to match her standard. I was so confused so I said ok long story short, you just want me to buy you expensive bags and watches is it? She said yes. Then I said did you just contradict yourself then? She said well it is ugly to say it out directly, she is giving me a chance to be a real man and gentleman and take the hint and spend on her without saying it and making everything sound not nice.
She then went on to say she is unhappy that I help out my parents financially etc etc and that I cannot give her a sense of security unlike her friends' boyfriends who spend 100 percent of their salary on their gfs and then borrow or take money from their parents to cover their own living costs. I countered by saying isn't that leeching off the older generation? She scoffed and said that is called the power of a family, the power of a community. I know nothing about all these because I am from humble backgrounds and this is how the real world works.
I must admit I was super shocked to hear all of these. The only hint I ever got before this that she thinks this way was that she is always telling me about her friends' successful golddigging attempts and how happy they are.
Do you people think any of her points are valid?
It sounds so messed up to me but she said everything so convincingly and matter of factly that I am not so sure anymore.",,5906645136072565,119,432,117,2021-08-18 17:27:47+00:00,2022-05-15 10:04:12+00:00
56955,99303,"To all the girls, if you read this, I hope you won’t be like me – a woman who unintentionally destroyed a good man’s career, motivation, and confidence.
It all started 3 years ago when he was in Australia studying for his final year of bachelor degree, while I already graduated and started my job. If I were to evaluate him now, I would rate him at least 9/10. He never cheated on me, he never once talked about or praised other girls in front of me, he was extremely focused on his studies and was a good example to his fellow course mates and younger siblings, his hobbies were mostly about self-improvement, career advancement, and learning new skills, which can be boring to most people, he would have Skype video call with me a few times a week when we were in LDR, and he was a caring boyfriend too. However sometimes things in life just didn’t happen in the way it should have happened. Back then he was just maybe 4 or 5 out of 10 to me, because I failed to appreciate him, and thus destroying both our relationship and his career.
Just like any other girls, I get jealous too, but it’s not because my ex was very good-looking or attractive to other girls, but because of 2 things, first is he was being too helpful to the point where his female course mates would study with him, second is he treats everyone very nice, and I felt that as his girlfriend, he should treat me much better instead. So due to these reasons, we fought quite a number of times, despite being together for close to 3 years. He is also a person who doesn’t know how to defend himself or use the most appropriate words or sentences to explain himself, so during our fights, I was always the winner. And also I tend to go against his interest like programming and coding, because at that time I thought it was useless, why not just focus on your studies and be an expert in your own field, instead of wasting your time on something else that you might not even need in your future career, so we also fought about it, especially during some weekends where we visited each other’s place, and he just spent hours to learn those computing stuff. I mean it wasn’t actually that bad, but at that point of time I was already quite pissed with his interest, so seeing him spending so much time on it just got on my nerve even more.
Although he only had to be in Perth for a year, I felt that it was actually quite long, especially back then I was still a pretty needy girlfriend, so eventually I started to be more suspicious, more jealous, and more insecure too. As usual, we would fight, but it was all because of my silly and unreasonable factors, like he added new female friends on facebook, and I went crazy and asked why he added them or accepted their friend request, and some are even angmohs. He did explain to me that the reason was because of group work, and it was easier to communicate and share information among group members through social media. Before our worst fight happened, this incident whereby his plan to return to Sg for a winter break was ceased. He decided to attend a workshop that he was interested in, and it only happened once a year during the winter break, and so he had to give up his flight back to Sg. I later found out that it was actually a web development course that costs a few hundred bucks. I totally went all crazy since I already disliked his interest in computing, and now he gave up on coming back to Sg just to waste his time to attend this rubbish course.
The last straw came after a big misunderstanding. Now as I recall it again, it wasn’t actually a fight, it was just me being a big idiot. As we were having a video call, he told me that he was heading to bed after we finish talking, and I literally thought he would go to bed like he always did, but a few days later when I was scrolling through facebook, I saw his friends posts on another friend’s birthday celebration, and I saw him in those pictures and videos too, which he didn’t mention to me at all. After that, I took quite some time to compose a very long message to breakup with him. Right after sending him that message, I blocked him wherever possible where there was no way he could reach me. Some of our mutual friends tried to contact me too, but I thought they are much closer to each other, so they will help him cover up his lies, so I ignored them too. I went through a hard time by myself because I don’t have many close friends.
After he returned to Sg, he came to my place to look for me to explain to me, but there was nothing that I could do about it because I was already attached to my then-fiancé. During his explanation, he said he was really going to bed, but that night was the birthday and farewell of another exchange student, and his friends were celebrating at their dorm and invited him too, so he just went down for a short while to say goodbye to him, and then went back to bed. He didn’t know that he had to share with me such 5-10 min activity that wasn’t so important. Regarding his winter course, it was actually a rare opportunity because some of the speakers were famous profs from ivy league like MIT, Harvard, cal-tech, and he said it is very rare to have such course in Sg, that’s why he chose to stay back instead of returning to Sg. At that time, I was already attached, so even if his explanations were valid, I could no longer accept him.
It was only in the recent months I found out that my actions have severely impacted his life. He was an excellent student, but because of me, he failed to focus on his final sem, and did very badly in his final exam though he still passed. He previously wanted to study an MBA and CFA too, but little did I know that he had stopped pursuing his dream. With his resume and degree, he can easily find a decent job with around $3-4k as a fresh grad, but from what I heard from our mutual friends, he is doing a $2k+ job that only requires a diploma. Honestly I’m not that close to our mutual friends too because of that incident, but they did say the breakup had significantly caused who he is today. Although we have stopped talking, my friend actually passed me a hefty red packet on his behalf during my wedding solemnization. Knowing how little he earns, I felt bad to receive it, but I still did receive it as his form of blessing. I honestly have no idea whether he has any future plans, but apparently he has been working for the same low-pay position in same company for two years with little to no opportunity to progress.
If you ask me, will I be with him again if I wasn’t attached, the answer will always be yes. Right now there is nothing I could do to rebuilt his confidence and motivation to pursue his dream anymore. I’m married, and I can only devote to my husband, but I feel deeply sorry for what I’ve done to him. If only I was mature enough to understand his situation, if only I knew he was happy doing what he enjoyed, if only I could resist the temptation to meet new guys before he returned to Sg, if only I could be more understanding to walk through difficult path with him. It only took me a few minutes to block him from reaching me, but these few minutes was what resulted in who he is today – a poor broken soul with so much potential to succeed in life. All he wanted at that point of time was just one very simple thing, which was my time to listen to his explanation, but I never gave him any chance to explain himself and ended our relationship when he was still studying overseas.
So once again, to all the girls out there, if, if you ever happen to come across similar situation, please, please never be like me. Your ignorance to a guy may just be as easy as you thought, but you will never know how much of an impact on him you can make. There is no harm listening to explanation, especially when a guy is trying really hard, finding ways to reach you just to talk to you. It is easy to block a guy with just a few touches on your phone, but you will never know that you’re indirectly killing him from inside.
Once again, I’m really sorry for what I did to you JL. If I could return to where we were 3 years ago, I would have listened to you, and you would have been much better than who you are today. I’m really sorry.

56716,98685,"I’m a woman who found my husband late (at 32) and I just wanna say to all those 30-and-above who are looking for the right man, these things take time and it is okay to be single.
I dated 2 guys before him and they weren’t right for me. Commitment was the main thing they, as well as many guys nowadays, lack. My definition of commitment is very simple, there needs to be an understanding that once you decide to be with someone, you will be faithful to them until you die. I don’t want to have to hear all this crap about having platonic female friends whom you hang out with more than you hang out with me, or liking and following Instababes. I’m old-fashioned that way. Once you’re with me, you commit to me and I commit to you, forever. Otherwise the whole marriage/relationship thing is pointless.
My husband has had a crush on me since we were in JC. He did not have a single girlfriend since he confessed to me then. We got together at the age of 28, 10 years after our awkward encounter as teenagers. I wasn’t even in his class. We just had a mutual friend.
After JC we didn’t speak for a couple of years until we bumped into each other in Europe. That was when I realized maybe we were really meant to be with each other. And then our mutual friend told me he has been asking about me every time they met for 10 whole years. No he didn’t reach out to me for 10 years, and he said because he didn’t want me to be uncomfortable because I was always with someone else.
So far, he has been the best husband any girl could ever ask for. He lets me do whatever I want, he supports me, he spends time with me, he insists that he washes the dishes, he does laundry, he irons my work clothes, basically he just trusts and loves me completely. Every morning, the first thing he does when I wake up is he will gently kiss me on my shoulder. He has done that every day since we moved in together. I don’t know man. I just know I’m never leaving him.
I think sometimes we marry the people we love and other times we love the people we marry. With my husband, I think I fall in love with him a little more every day I’m with him and now I’m completely obsessed with him. I can’t sleep without having him next to me, and every time I go on overseas work trips for just a few days I’d cry in my hotel room because I’d just miss him so much.
If you don’t find someone good, don’t waste your time. But if someone good comes along, know that even if you don’t like him right away, there’s a chance you might be after a while.

56458,97902,"My girlfriend stays over at my place sometimes and she'd use disposable panties whenever she does that. Something she doesn't know is that after she leaves, I'd take her used panties to sell on Carousell to those pervertic guys who buy girls' used underwear to sniff.
It's actually quite lucrative and the amount I sell them for ($5) makes it such that I'm able to buy a fresh pack of disposable undies for her to wear and subsequently sell again. I think I'm a genius for thinking of this.
However, recently she was using my phone and found out that I was selling her used panties! She was super angry and demanded that I split the profits with her. I refused as I have been taking the money to provide her with more panties to wear at my place, she was already benefiting from it. WDYT? Should I be splitting the profits with her?

57387,100670,"My boyfriend is bi and his exes were all guys. I'm aware and don't have any issues with his sexuality.
Recently I got to know one of his close friends and he briefly shared that my boyfriend was the bottom in all his relationships and hook ups. I thought he was kidding but he laughed it off and said I can ask my boyfriend if I don't believe.
I'm a bit thrown off as my boyfriend looks like the top in a gay relationship instead. He's tall, fit, tanned and is quite well endowed down there.
I didn't ask him directly initially and snooped around his room when I stayed over. While rummaging through belongings, I found his d**do and it's bigger than mine... wtf.
I confronted him about the d**do and asked him about his bottom status and he didn't even deny. He said he likes the feeling from receiving and uses the d**do now for his own pleasure now that he's attached with me. He even clarified that's where the male g spot is and there's nothing to be ashamed receiving pleasure from there. The only taboo is straight people might see it as gay, which he emphasises is not as it's an anatomy thing.
He also reassured me that he enjoys s** with me and has never betrayed me with any guys. I trust him on this.
I tried to move pass all of this but it's challenging, especially when we have s**. I will imagine him being penetrated and dominated and I just lose all my interest in s**with him. I just cannot unsee and unhear that he's a bottom.
My sub conscious self also tells me that he's less manly and can't provide me with the security I need. I know it's selfish of me to think this way but I can't help it.
Anyone who has the same experience or has advice on how I should deal with this?

At age 37 my bf is only at the executive level. he earns around $4500 a month. I expect him to earn around $15k a month for a director-level position. At his age, he should be a GM/Director by now but he is just a lowly legal counsel with low pay working for an SME business with little to no benefits.
Should I leave him? Should I look for something better for myself? I am a 23-year-old local Chinese. And I still feel that I have a future unlike him. I don't want to waste other opportunities for other men to provide me a better life. FYI he took a year just save up for a Gucci Bag. How pathetic is that?
We have been together for 5 years and I had not seen him get a promotion or increment since then. Girls and Guys please help. my BF is a local guy Chinese

57295,100431,"My gf and I have been together for nearly 3 years now.
We met in an orientation camp during our first year and I am 3 years older than her. She is from Malaysia and does not have much friends here so she spend most of the time hanging out with me. She isn’t exactly the “goddess” kind of girl. She is the girl-next-door type that you will easily fall in love with. Good-natured, cheerful and sweet. She smiles a lot. She is tall for a girl, at 174cm (I am only 178cm) and very slim. She is tan as she likes to swim. She wear her hair in a simple bob at chin length (till recently), which she trim once it touches her shoulder. She told me she keep the same hairstyle since primary school. She dress simple, T-shirts and shorts most of the time, or T-shirt and Jeans if attending class. She doesn’t put on makeup.
I like her a lot because she is very understanding and doesn’t have high expectation (of me). Unlike my exs, she does not expects nice and expensive gift from me. Sometimes she cook and pack lunch for me. She really cook well. She never complaint that I play computer game a lot, and she sit quietly at the side when I was having a game of basketball with my friend. She doesn’t go clubbing but she never complain a single time when I went clubbing with my buddy without her. She never flare up and never a harsh word to me. She don’t expect me to do anything for her and will even volunteer to help me run my errand.
At the start of this year, she start visiting me at home during weekends, and she will stay for dinner. My mother likes her because she is very polite, help in the house chores and she help makes dinner whenever she was here. Then one time, it getting quite late and my mother ask her to stay for the night. From then on, she stay over every weekend. We start to have sex. Surprisingly she is very active, unlike the demure self in the day. I can’t help but notice how skinny she is, and wish that she can put on a little more weight.
So every weekend, we live just like any young couple, study, watch Netflix, going to buy groceries, meals, sex etc nothing special. But I felt blissful.
Then something changed a month ago. She always followed me to the malay barbershop downstairs, and wait for me to get my haircut. But this time, she wants to cut her hair too, I was surprise and told her I can bring her to a nice salon. She said its ok as it here cheaper here, and moreover she want a shorter cut which normal salon don’t do good. So I watched helplessly as the barber cut a good 10cm of her hair to a boyish cut that revealed her ears. If it was cut in a salon, it will pass off as a pixie cut, maybe more feminine. I don’t like it and told her to grow her hair long. She just smile. My family members are surprised by her haircut too. But my mother was all praise at how sweet she look even with such short hair. I can’t believe my mother actually encourage her.
Anyway, after this incident, I become conscious of how Tomboy she look and dress. I get annoyed when my female friend teased that she looked great and will fall in love with her.
So the last straw. Last week I went for my monthly haircut, she said she wanted a trim as well. I told her No as she supposed to grow her hair long. She said just a trim as the hair at the ear is sticking out and keep persuading me. Finally I agreed. So after my haircut, she sat down on the same chair. She converse with the Encik in malay for quite a while and the cape was put on. To my horror, the barber start to use a clipper and dig deep onto her nape and high onto the back of her head. I exclaimed that it shouldn’t be this short. My gf however assured the barber it’s ok and urge him to continue. I get really angry with each pass of the clipper. The final cut is a neat man haircut with closely clipper side and back. The top is no more than 5cm and well combed. My gf can easily pass off as an army regular anytime. I was so angry I cursed at her. I keep silence the world day without speaking to her. At night, seeing that I am still angry, she offer to have sex with me. While we are at it, I can’t help but keep seeing the closely clipper part of her head. It feels weird on my hand and I lost interest. I feel like I am having sex with a man.
It’s been a week since I avoid her. I know its only hair and it will grow, I should not be petty as a man. Moreover she is such a wonderful girl. But she lost all her attraction to me and I can’t kick away the feeling that I am dating a man.
I know I am the jerk to be thinking this way. I am blessed with such a wonderful girl as my gf, but at times I really wished that she is more curvy and well-endowed; and doll up a little.

55782,96157,"My boyfriend is a heavy porn user and he says it's normal to frequently get off to porn even when in a relationship.
I was perfectly fine with it all along because men are all horny at a basal level anyway, until he started suggesting that we watch porn together as part of foreplay, or as an alternative activity when we're bored at home.
I resisted because I personally didn't like the idea of watching strangers have sex with closeups of their genitals, but after weeks of ""encouragement"" I finally relented and watched a porn piece in proper for the first time in my life.
I can't say that I found it arousing because the moaning was stupid and fake as hell and they kept zooming in on the lady's nethers which aren't appealing to me at all. But he likes it and I love him so I have gone with it a few times.
However the reason I'm posting this confession is because porn made me realise that my bf's dick is... Actually on the short side. I won't state numbers but then I started thinking, what if the moans weren't THAT fake, the ladies actually have a better time than I usually do because male porn actors have long and girthy dicks?
It's been 2 weeks since we last watched porn together, but I can't get rid of this new ""penis envy""(?) feeling, wishing that my bf was better endowed. Since then it has significant impacted my enjoyment in bed because damn, it really is smaller than the global average. And no wonder it slips out often, iykwim.
How can I overcome this? I mean yeah sex isn't everything. BUT my bf is really sexual and sex is everything to him so I kinda have to repeatedly face this fact. He also has the typical ego and I don't think he'd appreciate his gf hinting in any way that his dick less than adequate.
And while I know I'd be flooded with all the fragile male comments in the vein of ""I bet your boobs also smaller than average bla bla"", please note that I never cared about his dick size UNTIL he kept pushing me to start watching porn with him.
I know the best way is to talk to him and suggest ways to spice up our sex lives, but how can I do this tactfully? He is confirmed going to be against things like me using dildos.
(note to admin: this is something I genuinely need help with so please feel free to censor any part of it, as long as it is able to get posted. Appreciate it.)

55976,96663,"Am I an asshole for scolding my bf for selling investment plans to my parents?
So my bf has been an insurance agent/financial planner before we even got together, and I'm supportive of his career choice. We've been together for slightly over a year and we've met each other's parents a couple of times already. Still, he has only met my parents about 5 times since we only meet up as a family for gatherings like someone's birthday or CNY.
My bf had told me that he wanted to sell insurance/investment plans to my parents and I said no, because I didn't want my parents to think badly of him. You know, the stigma around insurance agents/financial planners.
Then, I just found out that he sold an investment plan to my parents. He waited for me to leave the house to settle some errands and then talked my parents into buying the plan.
Thing is, the plan looks absolutely horrible. My parents have to pay 50k a year for 5 years. They will then get a lump sump back at the end of the 5 years with interest. My parents are retired, and they have about 300k in cash savings. This means they have to set aside 250k in their bank to pay for these 5 years, which means this plan is locking their retirement money which could be put in some other investment plans/stocks. This also means that they only have 50k to spend for the next 5 years which I think is definitely not enough. I feel like this plan is more suited for people who are still drawing an income and can set aside 50k a year to save, and not for people with the actual cash in hand now in retirement. If anything, they should be buying a plan that dumps 250k in now, then withdrawing X amount a year instead.
Now my parents are quite happy with the plan, saying that it has a good interest and all, and my bf is happy that he earned the commission and has somewhat gained respect from my parents as a financial planner. My parents are really not financially literate and the money they have now is from their lifetime of saving. They do not have much cpf because they were self employed (small provision shop). I have not told my parents how stupid this plan is because I'm afraid they'd start to hate my bf or they'd just not trust me, but I feel like it is my duty to protect my parents' interest. Also, they are very stubborn and I feel like I will not be able to convince them to cancel the plan.There's still time to cancel the plan without any fees but I'm in a real dillema now...
My bf is disagreeing that this plan is stupid, and he said my parents have the right to invest in whatever they want without my approval, and he emphasized that they are happy with it. What should I do? I've told him to bring up cancelling the plan instead else I'd do it instead and he said I'm putting him in a spot.

55035,94244,"I am a 23 year old Singaporean Chinese girl. Nice looking and I am single by choice. I have rejected dates so far because I felt I want to spend my time helping people.
What happened recently made me sad. I dont think I did the wrong thing. I am not sure why people I told to pass negative comments.
I was taking the train home when I noticed a Indian man crying silently in the train. He was trying to hide it but it was clear to me. I took a seat next to him and asked him if he is okay. He did not respond. So I stood up and hugged him close to my chest. Then he started to cry more and more audiably. It was messy indeed with tears and mucus. But it did not bother me. I was more concerned he may end his life or do something drastic. I kept hugging him till the end of the journey. By this time he was rather quiet. I looked at him and he seemed tired from crying. He managed to force some smile and thanked me. He told me he was planning to end his life that day as he had a number of problems from family to financial. He said he did not know nice people like me existed. He said he sees the world differently and he will now try to live and press on.
To be frank this made me feel really good. I was really filled with joy because I felt I stopped someone from taking his life away. I felt I gave him something to live forward. Maybe for the first time he realised that a stranger can care for him a lot also.
Now the problem is my family and friends. They make comments like ""What if he molested you?"" Or things like ""An Indian, you like black issit?"". I feel sad getting all these negative comments. I would have given a hug no matter who it is - old or young, ugly or handsome, ugly or pretty, male or female. Race is also not an issue for me.
I need validation that I did the right thing. So I post it online.

56916,99406,"#99406: My bf has a close female friend - that friend that guys would tell their gf that there’s nothing to worry about.
They’re good friends, not bffs but he often shares important news and updates with her and regularly catch up with her. She knows his family and extended family while I have yet to meet any despite being in a relationship with him for a year.
Im not particularly concerned about their relationship but my friends kept telling me that something is very off about this friendship dynamic. My bf had previously confessed to his female friend 3 times over 4 years but she turned him down and they remained as good friends. She’s not in any of his cliques so they often hung out 1-on-1. Each time they went out to eat with one another (~every 2-3 months) he would drive up to fetch her and bring her to a high end restaurants, and the bill often goes up to $300++, of which he pays for it 8/10 times. Their meetups often lasted between 4-6 hours everytime, which others say its relatively long for a catch up session as it could go slightly past midnight occasionally. However, he always make sure to keep me updated when he meet with him.
On the other hand, he would bring me to eat in hawker centres, fast food places or purchase ready made food from 7-11/donki, not that I complain because they’re delicious! But we never had a fancy date due to budget constraints and i always paid for my share of the meals too or even pay for both of our meals. He would also ask for me to pay for it at the end of the day.
My friends are saying that treating a friend, particularly someone he used to like (or still likes) for expensive meals while not doing the same for me, his gf, is a red flag and i should have a talk with him about it.
As he was very open about his interactions with his female friend to me and is willing to disclose such information, i generally do not feel jealous or be suspicious about it. Furthermore, i feel that meeting his family would be something i would do in the future, not at present as we are both busy with school and work.
But is this issue something i be concerned with and clarify with him about?",,5906717556065323,132,171,93,2021-08-18 17:46:24+00:00,2022-05-15 10:04:10+00:00
57425,100810,"Recently, my department welcomed a fresh grad. When asked if this is his first job, he said no. He was actually from an e-commerce company but left the organisation. I didn't probe too much into the details of his leaving. But I would just like to say that it's ok for fresh grads to feel pressured and stressed when they first start to work. It's also ok to see them leave their first job within a matter of months. In fact, it's normal. I too, was a classic case of leaving my first job after several months due to some matters.
Why is it ok? Fresh grads tend to have this mindset of what their ideal job should be. They aim and strive to create that perfect picture in their first job. But reality isn't always the case and setbacks and disappointments ensue, which cause them to leave the work. It's actually good, because now they know that the line of work doesn't really suit them, be it people, responsibilities or company vision, mission. Since they are young, they are able to bear a bit of the loss and search for another job.
If they get another offer, good for them. If they don't, then it's time to search hard. And this is also a lesson for them. To cherish and realise that their ideal job is not as realistic as they thought it to be. Then in their next line of work, they would be able to put aside such thoughts and focus.
People who think that these fresh grads are strawberry or durian generation. No they are not. They are just normal human beings that are still trying their best to navigate the working world, one that is already being ruled by laojiaos who set the rules as and how they want them to be, and these young people have no choice but to get used to it.
So let's not judge them and instead, support them. Teach them the things they need to do their work. Don't know much excel skills (most grads I know really know a few basics only because in uni, who uses excel often? It's all R, Python, Solidworks, Matlab, Arduino), teach them what you use.
They don't talk during department lunches. That's fine. It's their way to assimilate and trying to be a part of the group. Initiate conversations with them, get them to talk about themselves. And please, after a few months, there's really no need for department lunches. Sometimes, even I want my own time to just rest my head on the table in silence instead of faking smiles at the kopitiam table. Let them do their own things during lunch. You never know, they might be watching a drama that you are watching too. More things to talk about.
To all young and fresh grads, know that you are not alone, this guy here typing, and many others out there were just like y'all. Learn and absorb. Blend in well without losing yourselves. And always be courteous and reasonable, and pass down this attitude to the next generation of new people. Because like you, they will need your support.
