60565,107026,"WHY ARE WOMEN SO MATERIALISTIC NOWADAYS!?
Girl A: Said she will not accept my marriage proposal if the ring cost below $15k. She told me the unspoken rule for proposal ring is 3 months salary or more... WTH!? That $15k could have been better spend elsewhere instead of a stupid diamond which is a depreciation assest.
Girl B: Said a cheap wedding band would suffice. She even told me that we should host a simple small scale wedding ceremony so that we can save those monies for future home renovation and furnitures.
My heart was touched when I heard the words of girl B. I couldn't believe that such lovely girl still exist in today's society! In the end I chosed to be with girl A, because she has a bigger boob size of C cup.

60782,107547,"When you break up with your rich gf to be with a pretty one and it ended up ruining your life.
My first gf was in nus. She comes from a rich family. I know exactly the type of guy she like so I became exactly that to get her. It was great when we're dating. She would surprise me with dates of staycations, fancy restaurants, movie nights. I would offer to pay but she would decline as she knows I'm still giving part time tuition to supplement my allowance as I'm also studying.
Tbh I'm not that into her but I kept it going as I really enjoyed the company and the lifestyle. I come from a humble background but have always aspired to make it big when I graduate.
Then this new girl entered my life. She's the hottest girl I've ever met irl. She also happen to be newly single and all the guys were swooning and wanting to get her attention. I was lucky enough to have common friends with her and got introduced.
Fate was on my side, my old gf had an argument with me and I used the chance to break up with her. I did my best to make it seem that it was coincidental. When I couldn't wait any longer I openly pursued the new girl.
I admit I was aggressive in chasing her as I knew she had other suitors. Things didn't work out as well as I thought once we are officially together.
We argued everyday. It was mostly because I suspect she was still talking to other guys. I can't help myself and would get angry when she has other guys around her when in school. Why can't she just hang out with the girls?! I hate her best guy friend who's known her since she was in secondary school. Why must they still keep in contact? Aren't I enough?
I bought a diamond ring for her to wear which she did but I still think it's not enough. We still argue everyday. I'm so bloody angry with her. Why can't she just not give me reasons to doubt her?!
I made so many arrangements with her. Set up bank account together with her. We leave personal belongings in each other's place. I mostly want her to leave her things at my place because it's easier for her to stay over at my place as her family are not nice.
I have lost count the number of times we argue, break up, I buy flowers to win her back. I admit I let my insecurity get the better of me sometimes. But it's her fault. She's too pretty and she did nothing to assure me that she won't cheat on me.
When she started her internship I knew she would stray one day and I was right. I caught her walking with a male colleague out of the office building. When I confronted her she told him to quickly leave. If they were platonic, why won't she introduce me?! She said I'm embarrassing her. I snatched her phone and left and she didn't even chase after me. Isn't this a sign of guilt?
She said its over so many times until I don't believe her anymore. I always am able to coax her back to me. But not anymore after this. I suspect she's seeing someone who works with her. That is the only explanation.
I destroyed everything of hers that she left at my place and she closed out the bank account that we shared and dared to tell me she was the only one putting money in so the money is all hers. What about the amount of money I spent on her?! That diamond ring isn't cheap! She had the cheek to change her numbers and even got her family to hang up on me. I made sure she remember everything that happened is her fault. She ruined me. I will never forgive her!
Pretty girls are over rated. She doesn't even have much money and yet acted like I'm the money greedy one. Wait till I earn 100k per annum, I'm sure she will regret leaving me!

60922,107835,"Today is my daughter’s 10th birthday, and sadly she doesn’t even know I exist.
One year after graduation, I met this wonderful girl and we clicked instantly. It only took a few months before we’re together officially. 3 months after we got together, she got pregnant. 
Panicked and feeling totally unprepared to be a husband and father, I asked her to abort the baby. She said we could afford it and insisted on keeping it, and that led to numerous heated arguments that caused the breakdown of our relationship. I was torn, I didn’t want the baby, but I couldn’t bear to lose her, so I didn’t break up with her immediately. Selfish and young me thought of the things that I might need to give up if I were to have the child, like I could no longer travel and go out with friends as and when I wanted, I’d have no time and less money to spend on my hobbies, and my career progression might be delayed. Also, I was hesitant about marrying someone I only knew for a few months, not sure if we’re really compatible, if we both could live peacefully together and gave our baby a loving environment to grow up in. For months I was in denial that this is happening and was so consumed by my own worries and fears, I ended up being absent throughout her pregnancy and decided to break up with her when she was eight months pregnant. She still messaged me on the day she gave birth, saying she wanted me to see and hold our baby because she believed it will change my mind. But I chose to ignore her. 
A year later, a mutual friend attended my daughter’s birthday party and told me how adorable and smart she has grown, and all of a sudden I felt immensely guilty and regretful for not being there for my own child. So I attempted to reconnect with my ex, but she refused to meet me. She said I had never been there for her during her toughest days when she needed me the most, and I had never contributed a single cent, what’s the point of letting such a heartless and irresponsible person back into her life now? She said I’m as good as dead, and she and our baby were thriving and happier without me. She then blocked me everywhere. I even went to the extent of dropping by her place to find her, but her parents chased me away and said I’m a horrible person and they’d never accept me as part of their family.
Recently, I found out she is now happily married to a rich startup owner and has a pair of twins with him. Meanwhile, I’ve been on dating app for years and still haven’t found anyone that compares to her. I still remember vividly how comfortable and loved she made me feel, how we both were so happy just doing simple stuff together like cooking and watching shows. I can sense most of my dates are only after my money and don’t genuinely care about me. I’ve been progressing quickly in my career and enjoy comfortable salary, I have freedom to travel anywhere and money to buy anything I want, and I’m moving into my own place soon,  but I still feel so empty. Since my peers are mostly married with kids by now and busy with their own families, I barely have anyone to hang out with and I start yearning for a family of my own. Deep inside I feel perhaps I get bad karma for abandoning my partner and child 10 years ago. Perhaps the universe will never grant me another child and I will die alone, I guess I deserve it. I deeply regretted my decision back then and will live in guilt for the rest of my life. Each year on my daughter’s birthday, I will think of her and cry myself to sleep. How can you miss someone so much when you never even meet them?
To anyone dealing with unplanned pregnancy, I hope my story will enlighten you. Please make your decision wisely. Unless there are medical reasons, financial difficulties, or irreconcilable differences as a couple, please try your best to work things out with your partners, bring your child to this world and be there for them. 
Anyway, will just leave a note for my ex here since she was from NUS and may follow this page.
Dear A, 
I guess by now my apology won’t matter anymore, but I still want to say I’m very sorry. I should never have left you and our daughter and gave up on us. I’m glad you now have a big happy family that you’ve always wanted. I still care for you and our daughter and I really look up to you for being such a capable mother. If our paths ever cross
again and we are fated to be together again, maybe in another life, I promise to be a better man for you.
Love,
S

60318,106546,"My dad is a wildly successful business owner with a tech recruitment agency with operations in New York City and San Francisco, and a net worth in the tens of millions. We live in a bungalow in Bukit Timah. He always told me and my older brother that we should never aim to be a corporate slaves because if one were to commit to working hard for anyone, it should only be for ourselves. I have been told this multiple times for nearly 30 years of my life. He is also of the opinion that people who strive to do very well in school and for their company, will rarely create life-changing wealth, because they are too socialized to doing well for others.
I have done well in school. I went to the best IP school and I graduated FCH from law school. Near the top of my cohort. I then got a masters from Cambridge, where I was also near the top of my cohort. Now that I’ve gotten a big four law job, I feel that my life is comfortable, I make good money, my bosses love me, and I feel no incentive to make it on my own. I was even told in passing that if I keep up my work I could make partner one day.
On the other hand, my older brother is a bioengineer, didn’t do that well for A-levels, graduated from the University of Michigan and then UC Davis, quit his pharma job to start an agricultural technology company in California with four of his friends from college that recently fund raised at an 8-figure valuation. Recently there was even an acquisition attempt that was rejected. Needless to say my dad has started to overwhelmingly favor him over me. He went to the same IP school as I did he was just very lazy about schoolwork.
I have a weird upbringing in that I used to bring home great grades from school and my dad was never impressed. My brother is a tinkerer and he built a PC at the age of 14 and back then my dad couldn’t stop bragging to relatives about it. At 16 he wrote a password manager on iOS that made a few thousand dollars in its first year and I literally have not seen my dad so proud about anything that I’ve ever done before. Not even when I was in the Humanities Programme and ranked 3rd on a literature block test in my JC cohort of 1000 people.
One thing he has never done is gave me explicit instructions to do anything. He has always believed in giving us a lot of freedom to try things and to fail. What affects me deeply is his unwillingness to show any regard towards those who are not inclined to challenge conventional life goals. I once overheard a conversation between him and my mom in the bedroom after he showed absolutely no reaction when I ranked first in my sec 2 class. He told my mom, “all he did was work very hard studying to do well on an exam, what’s so special about that?” That hurt me deeply. He has this deep distaste for what he believes to be a “typical Singaporean philosophy”—do well in school, get a good job, promote, make some money, retire. Which I frankly don’t know where he got it from since he also went to Raffles College, and he also has a degree from Cambridge.
I respect him greatly and I just wish to get some approval from him. I’m just not an enterprising person by nature. I find it odd that someone would look down on people who do well academically and aim to do well at their jobs. If my brother’s startup hadn’t been an immediate success he would have been working for no pay and no reward for 5 years. The amount of money I saved in the past 3 years alone gets me 80% of the way to making a downpayment on my first apartment. There was no risk involved. If I keep being on this trajectory I’d have more money than I know what to do with anyway. I honestly don’t need anymore than $5 million to retire comfortably.
I don’t hate my brother. I’m incredibly proud of him even though I used to not be able to stand it when his exam was literally 24 hours away and he’d be twiddling his pen in the living room watching anime. It always seemed to me that he was squandering his talent since I know him to be very intelligent. He learns things ridiculously quickly. Nevertheless I think the world values all sorts of people and I am incredibly happy that he has the creative energy that startup founders often share. I just don’t understand why my dad values people like him and not people who can really take an instruction and deliver the best work.

60748,107476,"Nice guys finish last. When guys are nice to me, it makes me not want to be with them. Really turns me off.
When you say you want to eat something, or watch a movie, I will purposely mention something else different that I want to eat or watch instead. And if you try to be nice to me by changing your mind and say you are okay with eating or watching the same movie as me, I rather date someone more manly than you.
I want a man who dares to oppose me and do something different from what I say I want. If I say I want to eat this, you better oppose and suggest something else instead. STOP BEING SO NICE AND SAY YOU OKAY TO EAT THE SAME THING I WANT!
Sometimes I like to purposely disturb the guy and see what he do. If I insult you a bit and you dare to insult me back, or be insecure about it, especially if I try to tease things about your insecurity, then it means you are not manly enough. A manly man will not insult me back, and will not be insecure even if I try to disturb and hurt him. A manly man will show me that he can handle it and not be affected by me.
I don't want to need to tell you what to do, you should know that whatever I tell you to do, you should not do. If not, then bye. It is not that we girls like to date bad boys, but bad boys are the ones who dare to oppose us and do what we do not want them to do. Too bad they also treat us like crap.

60718,107400,"My bf of 7years just graduated this year and is currently earning 4k a month. Throughout these years I have never once requested any big value gifts and the most expensive item he had gotten me was a ring and bag that cost around 700+ in total for anniversary.
Recently I chanced upon a Gucci bag which cost around 2k+ and I hinted to him that I really like it and asked if he could buy it for me for our next anniversary. He replied that he can’t as he is saving for a nice proposal ring which is expensive. So, I proposed to him to just get me the Gucci bag and I am fine with a normal ring i.e less than a thousand since proposal is just for the sake of showing to the elders and I am not really keen in proposal rings either. Moreover we will be wearing wedding bands after marriage and the proposal ring will most likely be kept inside the drawer for most of the time.
Just when I thought this was a good deal for him since he doesn’t have to spend as much, he flared up and raged at me, claiming that he will not buy me the Gucci bag as he wants to save his money for other stuffs. He said that it is his money and he shall decide what he spends his money on, and if I am really so desperate for the bag, I could leave him for another guy who is willing to get me such branded bags.
I know he is a little stingy with his money since the start and up till now, we are still splitting for dates even though he will mostly let me pay few dollars less. But is this a red flag about his character? I assume he lied and isn’t even intending to spend on an expensive ring. Otherwise, he would be more than happy to take on my idea of getting the bag I like and at the same time, he can save his money by spending less on the ring.

60734,107434,"Hi there! I'm a 23yo female this year and I have recently started working after graduation in a pretty well paying job. Things are looking up for me and I also have a hunch that my boyfriend is going to propose soon because he has been probing me alot about ring preferences alot in the recent months. TBH he doesn't really have any red flags and has alot of green flags: he's kind, caring, family-oriented and gentlemanly. Sxx is also very good and it helps that we both have high libido. Career-wise he is also doing very well too. I genuinely do see a future with him and want to start a family with him.
HOWEVER theres just 1 thing... He is 10 years older than me and we've been dating for about 10 years as well. And if you did the math... Well yeah, I think you'd get it. It kinda was child grooming? I'll admit we starting having sex really early on into the relationship (less than a year) and we have been active throughout. We also haven't been using any protection but in his defence, it was a mutual decision.
Honestly I'm torn after doing some self-reflection.On one hand, i really love him and want to have a family. On the other I find it hard to come to peace with the past. I find it kinda messed up. I'm afraid that others will know about the past and whether it will affect my ability to be a good mother to my children. I would say yes in a heart beat if he asked me for marriage a few months ago but now I'm not sure. Please advice this troubled girl!

60392,106699,"How can I reject my boyfriend's marriage proposal in the least hurtful way possible? I (25F) and my boyfriend K (26M) have known each other since JC and have dated for 4 years. He has always been good to me, treats me well, and I have no doubt that he loves me very much. Recently, I heard from a friend that he has been shopping around for engagement rings and planning for a surprise proposal. Although this should have been happy news for most girls, I actually felt worried, sad and confused instead.
The truth is, deep down inside I fear that I may have already fallen out of love with K. All my life I have been an (almost) straight As student and usually scored in the top 10-20% of the cohort. I am quite ambitious and competitive in my outlook, and some might even call me an overachiever. Since graduation, I have secured a pretty cushy job that pays close to 5 digits with high hopes for my future career progression.
K is quite the opposite academically. Back in school he was a bit of a joker and would rather spend his days hanging out with friends than revising. Although he was in a good school, his grades consistently scraped the bottom of the barrel and he said he ""just wasn't cut out for studying"". Despite this, K actually has very lofty goals and holds himself to (his own) high standards. He has always talked about his dreams of making it big as an entrepreneur and to be his own boss by the age of 30.
Although I desperately want to be supportive of his dreams, honestly I find many of his business ideas naive, ill-conceived and financially unfeasible. I tried my best to rescue several of his past ""big ideas"" by helping him research business regulations, liaise with industry partners etc. Yet, all of them turned a massive flop because they were fundamentally flawed to begin with. As he fast approaches 30, I think reality is sinking in that he is unlikely to reach his goal and will be stuck in his 3k/month admin job forever. In the past year or so, he has been showing signs of depression such as chronic oversleeping and self-destructive thoughts which has further sucked him into a downward spiral. I suspect that his pride is also wounded by the ever-widening gap between our life trajectories as he would refuse to come to company D&Ds with me as my +1.
I feel that my love for K has been slowly whittled down by the endless cycle of his doomed entrepreneurial ventures. I am exhausted from juggling multiple hats as girlfriend, therapist and business consultant. At the risk of sounding materialistic, I also find it hard to see a future with him buying a house and raising kids with equal financial contributions as I will probably end up paying for the bulk of it while also trying to protect his pride. With that being said, I will always care deeply for K given all the happy times we have shared together and everything he has done for me. He is a good and kind man who truly loves me with all of his heart, and I don't want to crush him completely especially given the current rut he is in. How can I let him down as gently as possible about his plans for a proposal, and would it be cruel for me to ask for a break/ a break up now?

60283,106462,"I grew up in a less than privileged background. I worked super hard, because my mother told me to. She told me that if I didnt work hard, she wouldn't pay for school. That it.
I slogged my ass off, raffles, then nus medicine. I just worked hard, listened to advice from my peers, and worked. I remember failing multiple times during this process, failing, and getting up, no tuition nothing. and before you think I am bragging, I am not, I am bitter. I am bitter because I had no help during those struggles, those struggles where I saw my friends going for tuition after their fun ccas so they could get someone to catch up with them, and then off for nice holidays after each tiring semester. meanwhile I went home to a crowded home with not much.
in university, my parents didnt even understand the course I was in. They said oh wow good ah doctor. But they didnt understand the stresses I was under, how my peers looked down on me for not being able to get that starbucks every week, or eat the same meal every day (""why you always eat the same thing lol"") no one said anything explicitly, but just people started hanging out with me less... and less.
Now I have a family, small but its mine. dont really have friends from school, just a few work ones who we get teh (coffee shop) together and its surprisingly the highlight of my week. I dont want to have kids because I dont want them to go through what I had gone through.
my mum, she was probably the driving force behind why i cant quit. I now acknowledge its my trying to live up to her expectations and make her proud that I did all of this. I never once dared to show her my failures, or my struggles, or my isolation. Because I was the son she was proud of, I was important in her eyes. and so I kept the path, never once considered seriously dropping out even though I had minimal interest in this medical path.
its 2am and I have just finished a shift. I hope that someone out there reads this and learns something from it. you wil inevitably be influenced by your parents/peers/society. this is something ive learnt that cannot be avoided. but what you can do is to be conscious of it, and to try bit by bit, to integrate a part of yourself in a sustainable way, a part of happiness in your life so that one day you can find peace in the struggle that is your job/career/course.
Have empathy for the peers who seem isolated and struggling, or even acted out in school. Dont write them off as introverts or whatever. They likely just have more to deal on their plates than you do, or you have more social/economic support than them to get through your shared circumstance. Maybe say hi, share notes, or reach out to them if you havent heard from them for a while and say hey, I see you, I know youre struggling, Im going through this with you (not in those exact words but like sometimes just company helps)
one last thing, I would also like to say thank you to that one senior in school who stood by me when things were tough and that it was very meaningful and prob was the reason for finishing the course.
I try to do that now with my juniors in the hospital. Anyway goodnight

60713,107387,"My husband and I met in NUS and have been married for afew years. He recently started golfing on weekends and I’m somewhat upset cus hes basically gone for half the weekend, like totally radio silence no text no call nothing on golf days. Anyway, one day I decided to prank him by hiding his gloves hoping to see if he will text me to ask if I’ve seen it, but NO he did not text at all, and I found it puzzling cus he complained about getting blisters in the past if he didn’t use gloves. We never ever had trust issues but this actly got me paranoid and worried.
So, the next weekend I threw my air tag into his bag to check up on him. And my heart sank. He was totally not in any driving range or 9 hole but in some random housing estate. I waited for an hour anxiously before deciding to Grab there to confront him. Heng it was a landed property area so I could identify which house it was from the GPS. When I went up to the gate, figuring out if I should ring the bell, someone tapped me on the shoulder and when I turned around, I just blew up. I saw my husband’s best friend’s GF, in PJs and holding random dabao.
Never in my wildest nightmares did I imagine I’d be in such a situation. I started accusing her of monstrous stuff, and how homewreckers destroy lives and shit, and as I went on I noticed shock on her face slowly turn into confusion and then finally into -_-“. When I stopped to catch my breath, she just opened the gate and said come in and see for yourself.
When I entered the house, there my husband was, seated at the dining table, with 4 of his other guy friends, all with their laptops out, playing dota. Long story short, he started golfing after I got mad at him to stop playing stupid computer games as an adult, but I guess everyone needs their own hobbies. Yea…

So a guy (Let's call him Matt) and his gf (Let's call her Jenn) lives together. They've been doing good together, until one day, they argue about going to a night club. Let's just say Matt doesn't want Jenn to go to a night club cause he's worried about her safety.
But Jenn insist, saying she'll be just fine. Matt still wouldn't allow it. So they argued a lot. Jenn however, always find a way to go to the club. Either by lying about her location, made excuses, or simply just wait for Matt to fall asleep early. Everytime Matt found out, he'll get mad cause he's so worried about her. Jenn however, continued to do this like more than 10 times, and got caught by Matt at least 7 times. 
Matt is very forgiving, but even he has a limit. The only thing he doesn't want Jenn to do is to go to a night club. That's it. Nothing else. But Jenn didn't care. Matt told her, that if she goes there again, one more time, the relationship is over. Jenn, thinking it's just another chance, simply just go out anyways. She doesn't care anymore. 
Unfortunately for that night, after hours in the night club, she got r*ped and SAed by a guy there. She called Matt, crying, told him everything that happened. Matt immediately drove and picked her up, went to the hospital and police station immediately to make reports and gather all those evidence. Took hours, 
but thankfully, the evidence gathered are clear, and the police said for now, they can go home while they go make an arrest on the suspect. It was very late night at that point. 
Matt, however, drove Jenn back to her parents' house. Jenn feeling confused and asked why. Matt said that he's sorry about everything that happened to her and it's not her fault, however, he's a man of his word. He said that he did warned her that if she goes to the club one more time, the relationship is over. Regardless of what happens, even if she's safe and nothing bad happen, the relationship is still over. Matt did say that if she needed help about the case, he'll help. But that doesn't mean he and Jenn are together. 
He already packed every Jenn's belongings from his house the moment she walked out to go to the club. All of it is in the car, and he carried it for her to her parents'. Jenn, crying and begging, asking him not to leave her and said she won't do it again. Matt however, said that he has his limit too. And he said why does it need for this horrible thing to happen then only she'll listen. Before he leaves, he told her again, that he's sorry about what happened, and that if she needed any help with the case, he'll help. But that's it. 
So, the question is, is Matt wrong for doing what he did in the end?

60456,106812,"To #106787 and those who got their A-level results recently: I agree with Prof Leong. I chose what I loved and studied math. It wasn't even my strongest subject. But it made me more money than the 99.999th percentile of software engineers and I now have enough to lounge around, write these long rants for the rest of my life, and gloat.
I didn't collect my A-levels cert on results day, so I found out my grades a week later. Just didn't like queuing and comparing grades. I was already admitted to the school I wanted, and the admission criteria for physics and math at NUS/NTU were low enough I knew I had my backstops. Turns out I was far from a perfect A-level score.
Admissions advice (somewhat CS-specific):
1. There’s wisdom in ignoring the current market outlook for choosing your career path. The market is extremely efficient, so if a particular major pays well now, you can be assured that it will be competitive and commoditized 4-6 years from now, arbitraging away whatever easy upside you get from picking that major.
2. This negative autocorrelation is already evident now with the tech layoffs - I know many in PE, PWM, consulting, marketing, sales, real estate, design etc. roles who’ve made more than their CS counterparts, with less effort.
3. There’s no free lunch. If it were really that easy to predict which sector would outperform others, you’d make even more money just leveraging your education funds in the stock market than studying in that field. Hypothetically, if you really would’ve had such a positive outlook on tech jobs 10 years ago, you’d have been richer just going all-in on FAANG stocks back then than getting a CS degree. And if you still feel your friends in CS really have better job prospects than you, it's never late to just buy into a tech sector ETF.
4. You don’t need a CS degree to be a practitioner. Incidentally, most of the best software engineers I’ve worked with have other STEM degrees or even no degree. 7th employee at Citadel - physics PhD, code still runs today, and he has more money than Jeff Dean.
5. Point 4 and ""do what you love"" translates into something I train all of my hiring managers to look out for. Which is that a software engineer who did in applied math at a top 30 school is most often stronger than a software engineer who did Course 6 at MIT.
6. Most global optimization problems are intractable, and only some highly-constrained optimization problems are easy. Applying this principle: it's bad to be ""interested in tech"". (I wrote #104647 on this.) Find a narrower interest than that. Even “interested in frontend” is not enough. There’s flavors of frontend: do you like frontend tooling and build, or frontend visual design, or building product flows, or maintaining component libraries? The sooner you can apply constraints in your career, the easier your (wealth) optimization problem. It’s hard to get rich by becoming among the top 100 frontend engineers in the world; it’s easier to get rich by becoming among the top 100 component library guys in the world.
7. I’ve seen many people falsely equivocate “Do what you love"" with being lazy. Truly doing what you love takes more hard work, grit, and determination than working for straight A’s to get into CS, law, or whatever course du jour. Traveling the world is not doing what you love. Writing a book; decorating homes; taking selfies; singing aren't. Doing what you love means getting so good at what you're passionate in that you've become one of the best in the world at it. It happens that I know people doing each of the above who've made 1-2 orders of magnitude more than the average L6 software engineer at Google. My best friend made more money modeling in her 20s than any L7 SWE I know, because she's good at it.
8. Taking a scholarship makes it hard for you to choose what you love. So be cautious. (And please don't be the guy with rich parents who breaks his bond after getting to Oxford, because you're depriving someone else.)
9. Pursuing what you love has ancillary benefits. Chiefly, it makes it easier to make quality friends in your adult life. It's nearly as hard making friends when I had $100 as when I had $100M.
I had lunch with the late Martin Trust shortly before he passed. If you have any clothes from H&M or Uniqlo made in Sri Lanka or Vietnam, you owe it to him. He said one thing that day that stuck with me today, ""I made my wealth selling underwear, so nothing's beneath me."" The man's short, but he stood tall. I heard he was surrounded with family and friends at the end.
Do what you love, and whatever you choose, don't fret if it's beneath your station. Because you'll have so many more ways to find happiness if you do.

60767,107559,"I'm (M30) a rather successful social media influencer. But hear me out, it's not what you think it is.
My wife (F29) is someone who likes to talk about and shares whatever she sees on social media. She'll be doomscrolling TikTok the entire day, frequently sending me videos of influencers showing off their branded goods, having fun at holiday locations, etc and asking me when I will bring her there. Bitch please, I just left my cushy corporate job to start my own business, ain't nobody got time for that shit.
She was getting really annoying so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I decided to start influencing her social media feed. I used her laptop and to google for sports, crypto news, AI news, etc, stuff that I know she won't be interested in, searched for similar stuff on TikTok and started liking and following content creators she won't be interested in.
At first I thought it didn't work, but after a week I realized she wasn’t using TikTok that much and I asked her why. She complained that her feed was really boring and nothing she saw interested her. It was WORKING!
I decided to take things a step further by making her see stuff she's moderately interested in, yet is useful so that they'll slowly influence her lifestyle. She has gained a bit of weight since our wedding but she’s too lazy to start exercising, so I started using her account to follow some fitness and health influencers.
Guess what, a week later she dragged me to sign up for a gym membership together and booked some yoga classes. I’m pretty fit myself so I don’t really need that but I’m happy to see that she's doing something about her health. It has been a few months and she looks much healthier. I'm super happy with the results of my ""social media influencing"".
Guys, social media is such a powerful tool. Do try out ""social media influencing"" on your family/partners/kids and you might be surprised by the results.

60750,107482,"Types of girls on dating apps in SG scene:
1. The ones who don't put much effort, writes nothing much on their bio, and uses their looks to get matches, probably for validation and attention. Examples include ""idk what to write here"", ""hi"", ""entertain me"", ""send me your best pickup lines"", ""idk why am i here"", ""my friend forced me to do this"", ""follow me on ig @______"", ""just for fun"".
2. The ones who are catfish. Pictures includes ones where their face is very zoomed in and not showing their body, or ones where they use some heavy face filters.
3. The ones who are wholesome. Usually has a well-balanced profile, dresses well and are looking for something long-term. Will usually put in effort to showcase their personality on their profile, and effort into conversations.
4. The gold diggers. Bio usually includes things like ""buy me ____ and I will love you"", or ""I'm broke"", or ""hope you can take me out and buy me some good food!"".
5. The ones who are looking for s*x. Usually contains one or more ""provocative"" pictures showing off their body, bios may say they are not here for hookups or fwbs, but who are they kidding.
6. The ones who have a strict height preference. Bios include things like ""If you are shorter than 180cm pls swipe left"", or ""Where my 6ft guys at? hehe"", or ""I'm tall so I need someone taller than me, swipe right if you are"".
7. The ""basic girls"". Includes things like, ""cafe hopping enthusiast"", ""I'm a foodie so I love food!"", ""introverted extrovert"", ""ENTP"", ""aries"", ""love to travel!"", ""shy at first but crazy once you know me"", ""just here to make friends only"", ""I'm shy so you should make the first move"", ""love watching dramas"".
8. The ""looking for security"" girls, but don't really care as much about getting to know you. These girls usually are trying to fish out what educational level you have, what uni you are from, what job or job field you are in. And these are usually done in a way that you can tell they prioritize these, over getting to know what you are like (they may ask this within the first 2-3 exchanges of messages once matched, instead of asking things like your hobbies and interests first). If your answers to their questions are not something that reflects that you can earn a good amount of money, they show quick signs of losing interest to carry the conversation further.
9. The boring girls. Bios are usually short and boring. Their replies lack effort and substance, even if they write on their bios that they ""love deep conversations"".

60246,106371,"For the ladies out there who have never been in a relationship or dating before, as a female myself (25 yo, NUS alumni), I want to share on some important notes before you start dating or a relationship.
1) Actions from guys are more important than words. Yes, a guy may claim he miss you, text you good morning, say will bring you you to xxx, say will do xxx. If they are just saying without any actions done CONSISTENTLY, then it is just plainly talking.
2) Please don’t accept a relationship just because you are afraid to be alone or already in the so called “typical age range to get married” or most of your friends are attached. Rather to be alone than to be in a relationship/marriage suffering!!
Side track: according to book I read, the most important things in life for a lady are:
A) Health
B) Own savings
C) Family and Females Besties (see guy is not in the list)
3) Watch out for his body language. If a guy CONSISTENTLY:
A) Keep his phone/phone screen away from you
B) Disallow you from using his phone
Explanation for A and B: he does that because he has something fishy to hide.
C) Never want to put your couple picture as his dp or post on social media or even discourage you to do so. Delete your couple photos on his phone.
Explanation for C: He considers himself to be in the “bachelor” market. Means he is still looking around for his partner or even scared of people seeing you two together.
D) Always talk about himself and rarely entertain you
Explanation for D: One sided. He only want companionship. There should be give and take.
E) Always online on WhatsApp/Telegram but take 10000 years to reply your messages
No need to explain you should know why.
F) Say “none of your business”.
This is a major red flag. In a relationship, you all are supposed to work and listen together, not one don’t care about the other.
G) Don’t know what he wants in a relationship. Even after months.
H) Flirting and Cheating. When someone flirted and cheated although he has you, it means that your relationship is not that strong enough to begin and typically he will not suddenly change his heart overnight. So please do yourself a favour to distance away from him. Why tolerate someone like that?
I) Always texting a lot of female friends. Go to female friends’ house alone and not with a group of people.
J) Not willing to fork out money for meals/trips on YOU. If a guy is cash stripped because of his family situation (eg. Take care of family/pay loan/debt), it is understandable. Otherwise, the typical guy will always have more than money to spend on you on meals. Imagine a guy having difficulties parting with his money at the dating stage/while in a relationship, and imagine if you were to have kids with him, he definitely want you to spilt/pay for the hospital bills and baby accessories expenses. Would you ever want that?
Side note: a typical guy will chat with more than one girl online/in person. Please keep your eyes open and don’t put 100% heart into the relationship unless you feel reciprocated. Otherwise you will get hurt.
4) I suggest ladies to watch videos from Stephanspeaks YouTube Channel (yes I am a fan of him). From his channel, I learned that a guy who truly wants to be with you would put 100% effort and his heart to be with you. He will be willing to spend money and time with you. No excuses. No mind games. You will be his priority other than his job.
Thanks for reading up to here :). I have been in the above situations blindly until I woke up finally. It has been very heartbreaking for me since I put my 100% heart into it. I cried alot and felt depressed and I am recovering from it now. At least I am thankful for recognising it at the start of the relationship.

60252,106385,"Depressing story time. You know how in school your teachers tell you that hard work is most important than intelligence? I used to believe that until I got into uni.
My PSLE 100+ almost went NT but got into NA stream. A lot of my classmates are typical pai kia, smoke in toilet, don’t go school and fake MC, have sex in school. I’m the more guai type, study hard, attend all my class but just shit at study. Maybe I stupid, idk, sometimes I see my other classmates sleep in class all day, never go school, never do homework but exam time results is same or better than me and it make me very angry, why I just cannot understand how to study?? My father kena fired that time, no money send me tuition but my teachers always offer help, give me extra tuition after school. My outside friends all also very help me, give me their school notes and past year exam papers. They all very smart, go atas school and express.
N level ok, O level not bad can go poly. At first want to challenge myself, purposely choose harder course. School alumni team even ask me go back talk to the NA NT tell them about my success into going poly.
Few months in results like shit again, lecturer also advice me maybe this course not my calling, not suited for my skills so change to easy course, close both eye also can pass that kind. Again study very hard, go to all my lecture always ask question and after school mug until last bus home then go home. Everyone told me I age a lot. My outside friends all also ask if I ok because I look like shit. No matter how hard I also pia because my family not rich, cannot afford change course then drop out, unlike my outside friends can go overseas do masters do this do that idw sound jealous but actually I quite jealous them.
Meet up with outside friends, all grad already, always talk about their work life, their job, marriage plan, BTO. I sit there like idiot because I 3 years behind everyone. They not purposely make me feel like shit, also give me a lot advice like do internship, do online course and build up CV all. Meanwhile I still over here studying like dog no time do internship or online course.
After mugging like shit for years, surprise surprise, average result. Fuck. 90% my course mate don’t even go lecture, always ask me and others help take attendance, but still results come back half of them better than me. Fuck. Really fuck, IQ 0 EQ also 0. Reaching 30 years old finally got 1 gf at 20+++ actually is I feel like I just anyhow settle for a gf because parents worried I gay or cannot get married so I shoot my shot with every girl. After that find out she also feel the same, just settle with me like I’m rebound because she just break up with her bf and want get back at him. We still in rs but sometimes feel like we just lonely together aiya that’s another story for another time.
Keep applying job, kena rejected by 99.999% company, only lanjiao insurance scammer give me call back. All the company tell me I no experience so cannot. Eventually bo bian settle for internship $800 a month while my outside friends working lawyer, doctor, banker all making 5-10 times more than me, probably even more.
How? Hard work? PUI! Hard work can put food on table? Can do well in school, get good job? Joke. I accepted already I just stupid. Think my big take away is the reason why is call “success story” because it almost never fucking happen.
Maybe make me better person? Can eat a lot of shit 吃苦大王 too bad in life king of eating shit get shit eating job and shit eating life.

61148,108278,"Response to #108252:
I’m one of Prof Ben’s former schoolmates at RI and this is a reply to his comment. I’ve been in the C-suite at a multinational for more than 10 years now I’m retired. I also graduated top 5 of my cohort at one of the most prestigious pure mathematics departments in the world. I think I am somewhat qualified to opine (at least on the industry side). I also don’t want this to sound like a rebuke, because it’s not. I actually agree with him on some level.
Agree that IQ matters a lot less the higher you go in most jobs. Yet, from what I gather, people with good management skills are a lot scarcer than people who are good technically. My company hired a lot of life science and biomedical science PhDs from Harvard, Stanford, Hopkins. You’d think these people are few and far between but we can always replace a scientist; it’s nearly impossible to replace a good middle manager. It is problematic because we have a million different ways to measure intellectual “horsepower” but we don’t have any metric for management skills. I don’t have a reliable way to find good managers. 
There are several takeaways from my career that I hope can be useful for the readers here. Aptitude does exist but it is a combination of what counts for raw intellectual power, interest, work ethic, and many other things we don’t yet know. It is easy to put it down as a simple “stupid-smart dichotomy.” In reality, not being interested in something or not putting in the work manifests rather similarly as not being smart enough. I had several schoolmates at university who were a lot smarter than me but they graduated in the bottom of the class. Not enough work, too much beer. 
Bear in mind, “geniuses work hard too.” In mathematics, the most famous in recent history is Terry Tao. A lowly math enthusiast like me couldn’t possibly be compared to the legend himself, but I’m pretty sure I’m closer to Terry in IQ than I am in industriousness or in inventiveness. In his early years, people would have probably spent less time awake than he spent doing math. Important to note: Ben was the best student not only because he has a good brain, he was also a peerless hard-worker. 
A couple of things about luck, which Ben mentioned as well. I knew at an early age that I will be doing a math degree. I did IMO and I liked doing math for fun. There was a straight line for me and it was out of pure luck that we are all taught math at a young age. If I had been a secret genius in marine micropaleontology, I would have perhaps ended up as a mediocre civil engineer with an exotic coral collection. Having said that, none of my jobs post-graduation had anything remotely to do with pure mathematics (number theory and algebraic geometry). 
The way people talk about IQ lacks a lot of nuance. IQ itself isn’t understood well and I have spent some time on the literature. There is still a lot to distill in that space. We don’t know how much of one’s ability to learn is explained by this concept of *brain power* and how much is explained by one’s dispositions and all behaviors related to the trait conscientiousness. Interest measures motivation and discipline is work without motivation. I do believe there is such a thing as innate smartness but I don’t know how useful it is apart from being a way to explain away why someone is putting in the work and not getting the result. It’s not the whole picture. There are many ways to look at this, one of which is pretty obvious—you’re working but it’s mostly unproductive work. If you stared at your textbook for 18 hours without intention, you’ve worked 18 hours but you learned nothing because your heart isn’t in it. Why isn’t your heart in it? Possibly because you chose CS after reading about $250,000 starting salaries at Google and not because you were even remotely interested. This has nothing to do with aptitude you’re just in the wrong place.
Being thoughtful about your interests is more important than just working hard. There’s no point pursuing a high-paying industry to be a 10th-percentile worker because there’s a chance you will make no more than a gas station attendant working the graveyard shift. The head of the business development division cleared $1.25M the last year I worked there. She majored in English at a Canadian university. Ben would probably think that her job doesn’t require a lot of IQ, but I wouldn’t survive a day in her shoes. She is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met precisely because she is able to pick up on nuances and cues that I just don’t. If you think about it this is kinda like everything else—some people just pick up certain things quicker than others. 
This brings me to my most important point, the term “intellectual horsepower” should be taken to mean field-specific intellectual horsepower or skill. I’m sure a generalized intellectual baseline exists but I believe that there is a much bigger variable component that is determined by other factors, including interest, discipline, and industriousness. Every single one of my friends who are now surgeons and doctors will fail my degree at my university. Likewise I will not make it through a medical degree. I find medicine incredibly boring. I also failed chemistry in secondary school. Question, how could you fail chemistry weren’t you an IMO medalist? The answer is simple—when I’m in a chemistry class I don’t understand s***. It’s entirely possible to be stupid in one area and very strong in another. It’s also possible to be stupid in all areas or strong in all areas. 
The important thing is to remember, whether you’re smart or not, whether you have aptitude or not, the strategy is the same—you work hard. If the strategy is the same, you don’t get hung up on what your brain power is. By the way, and this is not a dig, it’s curious that only those in academia keep talking about intelligence and brain power. Lower-beings like me? We got something way more interesting we use to overcompensate—frequent flyer miles.

61100,108189,"Regarding #108150:
There is nothing wrong with wanting to be rich. My father passed away when I was in secondary school because of a rare but curable cancer, and if we had $250,000 when he was diagnosed, he probably would not have died. He worked in construction and my mom worked at a nail salon. I have 3 siblings and we all lived in a one-bedder. I know a lot of people will disagree with me vehemently, but poverty is no fun.
I am now one year out of medical school and my goal is to give my family a better life. 
Believe me when I say I understand fully that money will be less than useless in death. To me, making money has never been about what I can spend it on. Money will enable me to be a safety net for my loved ones.
Buying unnecessary things, traveling, paying over the top for a meal, I have never quite understood the appeal of such things. Not that I ever could afford them in the first place. 
My best friend with whom I went to Hwa Chong grew up not too far from where Goh Chok Tong lives in Bukit Timah. He never spends more than $5 on a meal. It puzzled me in the beginning but then he revealed to me that he’s not being intentionally frugal he just found it difficult to justify how a $20 plate of chicken rice is 4x better than one he can get for $5. Today he is a Ivy League graduate who is in line to take over his father’s business, but he is still the same guy who wears washed out t shirts, takes the bus, and eats $3 cai fan whenever we do meet. 
When I was in medical school, I met friends from upper-middle class families who were as frugal as I am. It was only surprising how common they are, people whose parents are specialists, lawyers, businessmen who are more humble than a blade of grass. 
I’m not saying it’s wrong to live your life to the fullest. How anyone wants to live their life should be their prerogative. But I think if you want to mitigate the regret you will feel if you died prematurely by ignoring the fact that the vast majority of us will probably live as long as the life expectancy seems to suggest (84 years), then I think it would be a mistake not to make preparations for those ages that you will no longer be productive. 
Lastly I just want to say this, seeing the world can be a great experience, but the same critique that you can’t bring money to the grave can also be said about your memories. You bring nothing away because you simply cease to exist. People who obsess over money aren’t all shallow and materialistic. Some of us need it to pay for a better life for the people we care about.

60413,106739,"Sayonara Singapore.
I came to Singapore 15 years ago, thinking of making Singapore my home, as it came on top choices compared to other countries, such as US, Australia and Canada. I have studied here and meet my wife here and had my baby here, however Singapore had a different plan. I am a PR for more than 10 years and they are not ready to give my wife a PR even though she has studied here and been here almost same time as me and they rejected application my wife's and my child's PR. So HDB is out of choice. We both make a combined income of 10k+ but more and more money is squeezed out of us. Looks like Singapore Values free money from China and Hong Kong than integrating locally trained people.
At present our house house hold expenditure is more than 80% of our income and our life style is just average, so you can earn and have a decent life in Singapore. But we feel we are just Surviving here and not really living. We are not evening talking about luxury here like car, condo etc. Just a basic life. And it's same for my Singapore friends but slightly better because of HDB. In general, Singapore is becoming a advanced society with surviving people.
What I see from Govt plan is either you are super rich or under 3k family income rest all will just be rich on paper but poor in real life. All my class mates (locals) have already left Singapore and I didn't listen to their advice to pack up 10 years ago. Now, I am Surviving. When I tell about these things , most locals will complain you can go back where you came from, but if we keep having such mentalities Singapore will become next Japan.
Right now, govt is happy to collect millions from foreigners ABSB and giving $300 CDC vouchers to keeps locals mouth shut. So, till govt doesn't prioritise welfare of people, Sg will be millionaires zombie land.

60768,107521,"Things I wished I knew when I graduated:
1. Prepare for interviews like how you prepare for exams. I learnt this the hard way. I thought interviews were suppose to measure how good you are at doing your job, but it really doesn't.
2. Ask for pay raise after your probation. If you are good at what you do, and better than everyone else, ask your boss for a senior/management salary. Bosses are usually not dumb, and will reward you accordingly.
3. Network well with your senior colleagues, the talented ones. Your colleague can become an executive of a unicorn, you can parachute your way there too if your relationship with them is a good one. But don't waste too much time with people from HR, Marketing and other fluff departments, most people in these departments are gonna be completely replaced by AI soon.
4. Start side hustles. Tuition, small business & more. This tiny income streams can really snowball to a huge sum down the road.
5. Invest most of your income. Don't keep your money rotting in bank. At least put it in cash funds, and have a sound investment plan, let AI handle it if you suck at managing finances.
6. Spend time with your family. Not your new bf/gf, but your parents & siblings. For the most of you, your parents are no longer going to be around when you finally have the time.
7. Spend less time here and on other social media platforms. And with that, you would have extra time for yourself. Nobody really cares about your daily life that you share, apart from the ones that you meet regularly.

60759,107503,"Hello everyone. This is an Update from Post #105064.
I had written about my girlfriend's terminal illness and whether we should get married. I'm glad to say that we did manage to register our marriage, and even held a small reception with our closest family and friends. From her illness early stages, we try to create as many happy memories as we could, and did our best to fulfill as many of her bucket list wishes as time allowed. Unfortunately, we were unable to check off everything as she has passed on recently few days before her 24th birthday. Since then, I have been grieving and mourning. Her absence is too overwhelming for me and I find myself lost, unsure of how to proceed with my life now that my wife is no longer here. I really miss her so much. Waking up without her by my side, missing our shared daily activities, and no longer taking care of her has made me super empty and aimless. My closed ones keep comforting me telling me that my wife would not want me to be consumed by sadness and that I should try to move on but honestly, their advice is impossible. My Parents and Parents in law have been trying to console me but I refused to accept the reality. Because of this, I've found myself pushing them away. My wife's absence is really painful for me as we've been together since secondary school. I’m afraid that moving on will make me forget about her. Memories of her haunts me every day, and the thought of me forgetting about her has made me in denial. At this point, I can't even bear to look at her photos or her belongings without breaking down. Even writing this is really painful. I have seriously lost all motivations in my life and I'm struggling to cope with the events that has happened. I feel like grieving and mourning will be my new normal activity. I just don’t feel like doing anything anymore. Life is so unfair to me.
I thought that writing in this space can help me to release some suppressed emotions, and perhaps those who have gone through similar experiences could offer some guidance or support.
Thank you for reading this.

60461,106818,"Everyone has a story, this is mine.
My dad passed away when I was a teenager. Before he fell sick he and my mom got a divorce. Their split was horrid and traumatic for me because I witnessed a lot of violent physical fights. I can still remember he held a knife and wanted to attack my mom. He swung and slammed the door into her and she let out a terrifying scream. Both of them are bad tempered and toxic towards each other. I witnessed all these when I was below the age of 10. I suffered from PTSD for years.
I remember feeling helpless and terrified whenever they start fighting. I forgot the number of times the police showed up because of all the yelling and screaming. Sometimes there's blood on the floor at the scene where they fought. This was how I remember the bulk of my childhood.
My mother is literally a crazy woman as a single parent. In today's day and age, I guess she can be called a bipolar, narcissist, borderline or maybe all of the above. She had no one to fight and argue with so she would regularly unleash all her emotions onto us, especially me, because I'm a female. When I hit puberty, she became more violent towards me. I was not rebellious. I studied hard, but she was never proud of me.
None of our needs mattered. All our birthdays were meant to celebrate her instead. Because that was the day she suffered to give birth to us. Every holiday was supposed to treat her like a queen because she deserves a break. She only cared about controlling us no matter how unreasonable and nonsensical the request is because we owe her our lives. She was not happy even when we followed her instructions. This was how I remember my teenage years.
I was always mentally preparing myself for her to explode on me. To be battered mentally and physically is the norm. There was no way out as I can't bear to leave my younger sibling alone with her. In a sense, I became a mother to my younger sibling. I fed and supported my younger sibling the moment I could because my mother abandoned all her responsibilities to 'find herself'.
She went on to have affairs with married men. Travelled out of sg for months, in the name of love. Lucky I already learnt how to cook by age 11. I remember bawling my eyes out when she left home with her luggage. I was 13. How tf do kids run a home for months without any adult? But we survived.
When her mood comes, she would go on a rampage and say we are cursed and we will grow up to lead the same kind of life like her. She hated our existence because she lost her freedom, her youth, her everything. For a while, I actually believed her that I should not exist.
Took me decades to understand why she hated me. I didn't end up having a lousy life as she expected. I found a job that I love and actually enjoy. I met someone, married and lived a totally different life from hers. I have long term friendships unlike her. All of us are leading peaceful lives now.
She is wrong about all of us.
Don't believe everything your parents tell you. They aren't always right. Never believe you are doomed to walk in their footsteps. There's always a chance to change your destiny.

60275,106447,"After working for 10 years, I think young uni students need to remind themselves that the industry is nothing like school. People who do very well in school will generally do much better than the average income earner, but there isn’t any reliable metric that we know of to predict how far up the corporate hierarchy you can go based on how well you’ve done in school. I work for a multinational, and the most successful Singaporean in the company, in fact one of the only non-American partner at the firm who is based in Singapore, was a poly student who graduated from Tasmania. One level down, and many of my Singaporean associate directors come from an enormous variety of backgrounds, none of whom did particularly well in school.
In Singapore, it is not uncommon to hear of young graduates from Cambridge or Oxford or an Ivy League university and it is easy to think that the competition is overwhelming. In reality we honestly don’t know how well these people will do. Being a very good student comes down to two things, natural intelligence and discipline. At work, many other traits are rewarded. It isn’t an asset to be sociable in school but the managing director of sales at our company made 700K last year. I worked on her team for a year and our job was primarily talking to customers and building relationships in the industry. Nothing technical. In school, if you’re the most technical person you’ll end up at MIT; at work, if you’re the most technical person it is rare that you will make management. If you do make management as a genius engineer it would have been for reasons other than your engineering skills.
Success in the world of business is even more varied. I have met owners of a small family business that make close to a million in profit every year from just managing rental properties for landlords. They clean, they market, they find tenants, and they earn a fee from doing it. I have met a marble dealer who made 2.5 million profit last year. I meet a lot of business owners because of my work in consulting.
It’s fine to be proud of scholastic achievements. It’s fine to pursue it hammer and tongs. But know that the world is enormous and people are rewarded for many skills and traits that many people would deem useless.

61012,108012,"I just got married less than a few months ago. I accidentally saw some screenshots of a sexy influencer on my husband’s phone. I confronted him about it, and he apologised saying that it is habitual. I forgave him and reminded him that he is now married with a wife. For context, we’ve been together almost 10 years before we got married. 
Few days passed, and things went back to normal. But my gut feeling says no. I know it’s bad but i snooped his iphone gallery. I know i’m looking for trouble at this point but I just needed confirmation. The photos are no longer in his gallery, but it’s under the Hidden folder. My heart sank when i saw thousands and thousands of not only screenshots of sexy influencers, but also sneaky photos he took of his friends who are girls. Some butt pics, cleavage. Some of these girls, he went out with without my knowledge after I wished him goodnight, after cross checking the dates of these outings with our past messages. There were also photos of absolute strangers at the gym, on the plane which he sneakily took. While these photos were not recent (like within this year), it all happened within the course of our relationship.
I am very disappointed, hurt and disgusted. Now i am in a dilemma. Do i confront him about it even though it’s mainly in the past (except for the recent ones he screenshotted) and risk our marriage? Because I snooped around without his permission. Or do I close one eye and pretend everything is okay, but knowing he could likely do it again? It’s definitely going to cause trust issues between us both for both scenarios - i can’t trust him anymore with his predatory behaviour, and he can’t trust me coz of my snooping. How do i go forward?

The guy who earns less than 4k a month.
I don't know you. But I've met men like you. I totally get why you made such sweeping statements about women. No one likes to be rejected. I can tell you one thing. Even men who make less than 4k a month can get women. But would you reject the women who want you? You probably won't even give these kind of women a second look as you deem them as not good enough for you. It's like you're a 5/10, wanting an 8/10 and looking down at any woman who is 4 to 6.
Everyone wants the best for themselves but what do you have that the 'best' must accept you?
I'm guessing from your post, not only you do not have money, you also don't have the looks, personality or intelligence to nab the type of women you're after. So what does that leave you? Focus on what you can work on. Calling women gold diggers because you are rejected just shows you haven't learnt much about women.
If a man have enough good points but don't make enough money, some women will be willing to stay around and work together with you. Trust me, you wouldn't want a woman who will be with you just because you can earn 20k a month. Just like all people who want to have a relationship, we want someone who is willing to be with us through thick and thin.
The only advantage you have is that men have almost no expiry date compared to women. You can be 40 and still date women from 20s to 40s while a woman of the same age have to settle for a smaller pool.
But above all, I still have faith that men like you would be able to find someone one day. She may not be your first choice, she may not be a perfect 10, but I can assure you, as long as you play your part as a decent person, lover, boyfriend or husband in this partnership and help each other blossom, she can become a perfect 10 in your eyes.

60902,107783,"I wanna know all of your thoughts about this. All of you, read this.
At the time of posting, there's a TikTok video that went viral about this couple in a car while they were on a drive thru, waiting for their food. 
So the bf was scrolling ig and happens that a pretty attractive woman's photo, possibly his old friend, appeared on his feed. Gf saw that, and asked, ""Why didn't you try to get her?"", to which he replies ""Cause I know I couldn't in the first place"". Gf then proceed to ask him to elaborate, to which he says ""Cause I know myself. I know my level. So I'm not interested to try"".
Apparently, this respond hurts the gf. The gf the says ""When you say that, you're saying that that woman is on such a high level that you couldn't get her. So which means you're saying I'm such a low level"". Bf then says ""No, that's not what I mean"". The conversation was cut when they got their food, and video ended there.
It went viral and so many people, typically women, be saying ""Omg your bf is such a red flag!!! You deserve better Queen!!!! You need to leave him!!! He doesn't appreciate you!!!"", and more similar comments. Because they went viral, the bf started to believe that maybe he's not right for her, thanks to the negative comments. He then peacefully broke up with her and requested the gifts he gave he to be returned to him. All those gifts were really expensive too. iPad, Air Pods, Marshall speaker, and many more expensive items. 
So what's your thoughts? 
Here's mine : The gf is at fault and wrong. 
I'm probably gonna be the only woman going against her, but I don't agree with her at all. Like first off, she asked the question, so expect getting the answer from his heart. I know she wants the bf to say things like ""Cause I already have you"" or ""You're way better than her"" or whatever sweet cringe bullshit. But instead, he gave out his deep truth, he says that she was out of his league, so he has self-awareness of his on level. Cause come on, in life, there's always, and I mean ALWAYS gonna be someone better than you. Some don't even have any self-awareness and acted like a douche and became a self-entitled piece of shit that believes they deserve better, when they don't even bring anything to the table (Looking at you, toxic modern feminist). So I respect the bf for speaking up on his insecurities.
But what did the gf do? Instead of understanding his point, she's making it all about her. Started questioning if she's a ""low level"" to him instead of thinking ""I see. That's understandable cause even I know there's guy out there that's way too high level for me to bother."" 0 understanding. She even recorded it and posted it on TikTok all for views, and that hurts and pressures the bf so bad, he blames himself for not being ""good enough"" for her and broke up with her. 
It's reportedly the guy has been a great bf. The gifts were one of the proofs. So what stupid reassurance and validation the gf need from him to say she higher level or not? It's not like the gf is any ""higher"" level, there's always gonna be someone else better but yet the bf chose her and committed to her. 
My husband and I had this conversation before and I wasn't mad at all. He is honest, and I know I'm not a supermodel kind. But the fact he chose me is the thing I will forever appreciate. Y'all who keep picking fights out of thin air and making it about yourself are nothing but losers like gooooooosssssh get a life ????????????????????????????????????????
If the situation was reversed, where the bf ask why don't she try to get a super hot popular tall rich friend of hers, and if she says ""Cause I know my level. He's out of my league"", the bf is expected to accept it as it is and not making any issues out of it. Cause if he makes an issue and show that he is insecure, suddenly he's toxic, he's a huge ""redflag"", he has ""small d*ick energy"" like whaaaaaaat ???????????????????????????????????????? Its wrong if men do it but it's okay if women do it. And women still cry about ""equality"" ????????????????????????????????????????
Then y'all wonder why no one wants you ????????????
Then y'all wonder why there's no more good men ????????????
Then y'all wonder why you're so lonely ????????????
This is why I will always be hated by women. I don't care if I'm a woman, but I will never support the idea of saying ""Men are always wrong"" or ""Men are evil"" from women. Look at yourself in the mirror and fix that shit first before you go and attack men. 
Get a life and touch some grass ????????????????????????????????????????

I too once thought I found the love of my life. That we will live happily ever after. I was so in love all the advice I've heard before fell on deaf ears. Don't repeat my mistakes!
Someone once told me that the biggest reason marriages fail is because women think that men will change after marriages but they don't. Men think that women wouldn't change, but they do.
And boy do they change... Within a few years, I can barely remember the woman I loved. And I'm not just talking appearance - it's the personality changes that scare me. Even her family commented that she is so different.
The once caring, gentle girl who was the light of my life is now my nightmare. Everything I do or don't do is wrong. Everything I say or don't say is wrong. Every wrong step she will dig up things from ages ago and stack them up.
Other than the 3 kids we have and love dearly, we are worse than roommates. Every time I thought we made progress, something trivial will trigger her and it's worse than ever.
So think twice, thrice, and 100 times before you jump the gun.

I just got married not long ago and moved in with my husband. However after moving in together I found that my husband is an extremely disrespectful person. 
We work from home in the same study room and as someone who loves to chat, during the day I often initiate conversations with my husband but he's never paying attention to me. He's always deep in his work and even when I'm talking he is still looking at his computer and typing away. I have raised this issue multiple times to him and he says his work requires a lot of concentration and he can't respond to me immediately every time I talk to him. He says we can allocate time during the day to talk, like during lunch or tea breaks, but not when he's working. However, I'm someone who needs to get something off my chest right away so what he proposed is unacceptable to me.
I find such behavior so rude and am contemplating a divorce. We don't have a kid yet and the stakes are low now. Other than this ignoring behavior, he's actually a responsible husband. Should I go ahead with it?

60316,106539,"Long story regarding my relationship, please bear with me as I’m looking to help couples that are going through this phase or eventually will go through it.
5 months ago, I decided to end things with my bf of 3 years. During our last quarrel, i felt that we were not compatible and I don’t see a future with him anymore. I’m looking for a guy that will treat me well, and he is not treating me the way I want to be treated. He is putting way too much priorities over his life and his friends over me. We only meet once a week and it probably was just dinner depending on availability and there were no new activities in our life and it felt that our whole relationship has gone into a stagnant phase, and both of us were not growing at all. Sparks started dying off, I felt like I deserved better, and eventually convinced myself to give up the relationship. And also to make things clear, there wasn’t abuse or cheating involved in our relationship.
2-3 weeks after the breakup(he continued trying for another 4-6weeks), he started coming back to beg me to stay, something that he would never have done for me before. He started saying sweet things like how our break up has affected him and how he can’t live without me. How much he wanted me back in his life and how he would change for me.
At that point of time, i still love him and care for him, but I think this relationship is not going to get anywhere, I spent weeks to convince myself that leaving is for the better good. I was overwhelmed with negative emotions and everything he said just turned me off. So of course I started ghosting him, and took weeks to reply him, despite him sending the long messages about how much he missed me and asking me to meet. Eventually he stopped trying.
I’m actually a stubbornly strong lady, the first two months of letting go, I was in pain, I still love him alot and can’t let go of him. But I told myself it’s going to get better without him. I forced myself to believe that it is over, I will have a better future ahead of me, I will find someone that will treat me better. Everyday, I told myself I will never return to my ex, I deserve better than him. The first month of no texting, I just felt neutral, it doesn’t hurt me as much, as I thought I have already moved on.
Fast forward to a month later after he stopped texting me, I broke down. The emptiness inside me start to swallow me up. I realised I can’t let go of him, I can’t give him up, my life is not the same without him. The months I spent to convince myself that he is not the right one, fell right through. I was in so much pain, I can’t sleep properly at night, I can’t even set my mind straight.
So finally last month, I let down my ego and reached out to him(lucky he didn’t blocked me). Turns out he is still waiting for me. He told me how happy he is to receive my text, he waited me for patiently all this while cause he felt like I needed the space. He never gave up on us despite my no replies and my resistance to meet him. And now we are back together. Spending the Christmas and New Year together.
He is totally a changed man now. He held to his promises so far for 2 months, I can see he really changed. He is putting his 101% into our relationship now. I guess this is where they say “only know how to treasure it when you lose it”. And the pain that I felt during the break, it’s something I never want to experience again, and I thank god for him not giving up on me during our break up period. In fact this break up period made us realise how much we love each other and strengthen our relationship even more.
To all the couples out there, if there were not lying, cheating, abusing in your relationship, even though at some point you lose all your spark and want to give up on the relationship, asked for a break up, it’s very normal, it’s part of life, sometimes it takes space to deepen your love for each other. If he seems sincere in coming back to your life, there is no harm trying again, at the very worst, you can breakup again in another 1-2 months if you noticed he didn’t change. Don’t let the ego of yourself of not going back to your Ex stand in the way, if he can drop his ego to beg for you to stay, likewise you can do the same.
At the end of the day, we just want a guy that is willing to love us, fight for us and never give up on us. It’s never easy for a guy to start begging a girl. Likewise, do not give up on your SO. Sometimes we can be really stupid and needs a breakup to realise what we really want. Of course that is if your SO, is still willing to fight for you. Good luck to all the couples out there and wish your relationship all the best!

60339,106592,"My mom cheated on my dad and they had a divorce during my O-Level year. I came home late one day because I was training for a race—I ran 100 and 200m—and a strange man walked out of her room. My dad was on an overseas business trip. I called my dad immediately and the divorce proceedings didn't take that long even when my mom was blaming my dad for being absent in the family because of work. My two siblings and I chose to move out of the apartment into a new apartment with my dad. My dad had one apartment which he conceded to my mom even though he paid every single penny for it.
It's been some years since I graduated with an FCH in applied math and I'm now in asset management and on a good income. For the past few months my mom kept trying to make contact with me to ask for money. She doesn't contact my brother and sister because they haven't spoken to her since the divorce. Since the divorce she dabbled in a few jobs and ultimately retired because she says she's too tired. She has a degree in accounting and she's was or is a CPA, I don't know how it works. She worked for PwC for several years before quitting to stay at home. She said she had to look after the kids when we had a domestic helper our whole childhoods and we were almost never home. I was in childcare until I was 7.
My dad dotes on us, pays for everything at home, and he alone paid for all three of our university tuitions, even for my brother, who went to medical school at the University of Sydney on no scholarship. My dad isn't that rich. He's been in risk-management at an insurance company his whole life. He just worked and worked and he loves us. Now that he's retired, he's finally had time to do things that he loves doing, which is to cook. So he decked out our kitchen with stainless steel commercial-grade kitchen equipment and he's just been making food. Last year on his 60th birthday, I bought him a custom French cooking suite, the kind that's used in fancy restaurants but smaller, I've never seen him so happy. I'm happy to see him being so happy.
I'm not on good talking terms with my mom although I still answer her calls. But she's never asked about my life, she's never asked about my dad, never asked about my siblings, all she does is complain about how hard her life is and how much money she has left. She has brought nothing but disaster to this family. She hurt us so much that my brother and I have zero interest now in being in any relationships and I doubt this will change. I really want this relationship I still have with my mom to end but I feel bad sometimes so I answer her calls.
Can someone please walk me through if I should learn to be more cold-hearted in this because every time I see her I see that man's face walking out of her room and my immediate desire then was I wanted to chuck something very heavy and very hard at his head, we had 4-foot vase in the living room then and I was already itching to do it but I held myself back.

60786,107553,"My dad is a business owner, self made man. Growing up, he raised my younger sister and I to be capable and independent. My dad absolutely detest ""useless"" (acc to him) people and this translated into our upbringing. He has been scarred by useless children of his rich business associates. Long story short, only 2 points are applicable to this story.
1. He will cut us off financially when we turn 21.
We can still stay at home rent free, but nothing else. We don't have to give parents monthly allowance coz acc to him, the amount is peanuts and he would rather we use it to be independent. If we retain and did not graduate uni by 21, too bad, we will have to pay the remaining school fees on our own.
2. If we are not 100% independent by 30, he will write us out of the will.
Independent means having our own home (rented or bought doesn't matter) and having enough money to feed ourselves.
As a results, I worked by butt off growing up, I chose not to go to uni to work earlier and ended up studying part time for my degree. I studied a course that I did not like, but it's practical. I bto-ed with my husband and now, before 30, we have our own house, kid and pretty good life. I sacrificed, did what was smart rather than what I liked, during my early 20s while my friends were enjoying ""uni life"".
My younger sister will be graduating uni this year (graduated actually). She chose her course based on ""passion"" and now have difficulties finding a job. She enjoyed her uni life a bit too much and took on a study loan when she turned 21, and delayed her graduation a few times. Therefore, now she has no money, in debt and no job. There's no way she will be able to fulfil the independence criteria by the age of 30.
She went back to ask dad for financial help. Dad refused at first and then said he can help only if I approve, as I followed the rules. Changing the rules halfway will be an insult to the hard work and sacrifices I made.
Should I give my approval?
PS, I decided against it. People need to know the consequences of their actions, especially if this has been discussed since birth.

60296,106497,"I was just 17 years old when my life fell apart. It all started with my first boyfriend. He was my age, and we had been dating for a few months. I thought he was the one, but I was wrong. He got me pregnant twice and I had to get abortions both times. It was a difficult and painful experience, but I thought it was all worth it for love.
My second boyfriend was 9 years older than me. I thought he would be more mature and responsible, but he ended up being just as bad as my first boyfriend. He was controlling and manipulative, and I couldn't get away from him fast enough.
My third boyfriend was only 5 years older than me, but he was the worst of them all. He played me like a fool and left me feeling used and worthless.
I was so focused on my relationships that I neglected everything else in my life. I used to vape and smoke a lot, and it affected my studies. I did very badly for my O levels, only getting 39 points. It was a far cry from the 213 points I got for my PSLE. I was in Secondary 5 when I took my O levels, and everything went downhill from there.
I was a Chinese girl and I thought I was fairly good-looking, but it didn't seem to matter. I thought that love would be the answer to everything, but it only brought me pain and misery. I couldn't help but feel like my life was ruined. I felt like I had nothing left to live for.
I used to be such a hopeful and optimistic person, but after all that had happened to me, I couldn't see the point in anything anymore. I felt like I was just a shell of my former self, and I didn't know how to move on.
I couldn't help but blame myself for everything that had happened. I thought maybe if I had made different choices, things would have turned out differently. But it was too late for that now. I was stuck in a cycle of regret and self-loathing, and I didn't know how to break free from it.
I wish I had known then what I know now. I wish I had realized that love isn't always enough, and that you have to take care of yourself first and foremost. But it's too late for me now, and I'm left to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.

60259,106402,"I feel depressed because I was rejected by a girl on a personal level, most likely due to my financial background.
So I’m a guy, fresh into uni and new to relationships. Last semester I somehow get the courage to ask out this girl in the same year as me. Long story short, we hit off very well. We met up 5 times over a month, most times for an activity and not just a meal. On the 6th meeting, I sense the vibe is strong and I confess my feelings for her.
Up to this point I’m 100% confident she likes me back. But then to my utter surprise and horror, she says, “let’s just be friends, I’m not really into dating.”
I’m taken aback and I ask her why. She is surprisingly amiable and she takes some time to explain that it’s nothing to do with me but her, that she’s ‘just not into dating’ and doesn’t feel the need to get into a relationship. She also claimed that she honestly thought all those outings were just as friends and she didn’t know they were intended to be dates and apologised if she sent the wrong signals.
Regarding the “I just don’t want to date” line, I’ve heard countless times before that such rejections are actually personal. On NUSWhispers and also among my friends, there’s this saying: When a girl says she doesn’t want to date at all, she’s just trying to let you down easy, but actually she just doesn’t want to date YOU personally.
It's basically common knowledge.
Knowing the rejection was personal was so depressing. I suffered a mental breakdown over the next few days. It hurt like hell and got me agonising over what part of me is so bad. Some part of me must be so repulsive that I would get rejected on a personal level, especially with that cliché excuse of “I’m just not looking to date”. This excuse that covered up an unknown reason pained me to know that I had some personal problem that was so severe the girl must have deemed too hurtful to say out.
I agonised over why she didn’t like me. I narrowed it down to the 3 main common reasons: looks, education level, or financial status.
Now I know there could be other reasons, such as not feeling a romantic connection, incompatibility or mismatched personalities, which are completely possible and valid reasons for rejection, but I don’t think that’s the case here, otherwise the girl could have just told me she felt we didn’t click / were not compatible / I'm not her type; and such reasons are good and not hurtful at all. Furthermore we went out so frequently. Since she used the “just not into dating at all” excuse, she’s most likely lying to hide a deeper reason, and is trying to be nice because the real reason could be too hurtful for me to bear. So I think the reason is unlikely to be incompatibility or mismatched personalities, not least also because we shared a lot of similar hobbies like painting, music, etc. to name a few.
So such a hurtful reason has to be either looks, education level or financial status (I can’t think of any other reason too hurtful to say out).
I agonised for weeks after that, wondering what was wrong with me. It sure as hell cannot be education level as we were in the same year and taking the exact same course, down to the same minor. We both said we were aiming to continue doing a masters after our degree. As for looks... it’s very unlikely to be my looks as we went out multiple times. Also my friends all agree she was within my league in the looks department. And she was shorter than me.
So, that just left financial status.
As full time students who are not earning a steady income of our own yet, I once thought financial background didn’t matter much as long as I was still decently dressed and able to pay for dates. After all, we were in the same course, and it should be our future prospects that mattered more, right? Apparently, not in this case. I got the feeling she’s from a richer background than me and she probably realised it too. Because through our conversations, I found out she attended an expensive private high school, lives in the central area of a major city (she is a foreign student btw), and travelled to more Western countries than me. Doesn’t take a genius to figure out who is from a more well-off background. To clarify, I’m definitely not poor, I’m middle class. I don’t have student loans and both my parents work decent white collar jobs, but my background is definitely not as wealthy as hers.
And I’m pretty sure she knows I’m middle class because she asked what my parents were working as, and also asked what countries I’ve been to. And yes, I also paid for some of the ‘dates’ at decent eateries. But perhaps her financial standards were just too high.
Now I’m not saying that girls are gold diggers, but I heard that even in todays day and age, well-off women with their own money still want to date guys of equal or higher financial background compared to them, not because they are gold diggers and want the guy’s money, but simply because a higher financial status makes one look more successful and attractive overall.
So yeah, the girl most likely lied that she’s just not into dating to hide the hurtful truth of what she truly felt, that she thought my financial status was too low for her. Furthermore she is a foreign student from a country whose citizens have a reputation for being highly materialistic and judging others based on financial background. Deride me all you want for stereotyping or generalising, but like I mentioned earlier, rejection based on financial background seems most plausible. Furthermore, I have friends from that particular country who always specified that whenever girls from their country say “its not personal, I just don’t want to date in general”, the rejection is in fact personal and the other party is bullshitting.
So yeah, it has to be financial status. The only reason that is both personal and too hurtful to say out. Either that or there’s something else so repulsive about me that I’m hit with that cliche excuse.
And now I'm hurt like shit. Especially because of that girl's excuse.
Even if you don't agree with my assessment on it having been due to financial background, you can't deny that the rejection was personal towards me, and some part of me must have been so repulsive to the point she would use that 'not into dating at all' excuse. Either way, the rejection sure was personal. And the reason hurtful and terrible enough for the girl to use that cliche excuse.
So this happened months ago, but I still feel pained by it. Sucks to be rejected on a personal level, and judged for your financial background. My self esteem has been shattered and I am depressed. Trying to get this off my chest before the next semester…

60595,107089,"22F and the dating scene makes me despair.
Me: 22F, active lifestyle, all sorts of hobbies ranging from trading card games to martial arts, lowkey chatterbox, honours year NUS student.
My standards: decent shape, has hobbies and interests he is able to talk about, and is in a position that I'm not likely to be the main breadwinner in the long run. idgaf if he's a poly grad with a side hustle, another student in my faculty, a fresh grad with fresh grad pay, whatever. Have something going on.
I am very very lucky if I can find someone who even hits 2 of those. Went on so many blind dates. One of the better dates was another TCG nerd who I could talk with all night, but wasn't physically attractive for me - alamak, what to do, close two eyes also cannot.
Then got the prettyboys who have interests but cannot talk.
Then got those who cannot present themselves well, but can talk... however, it is only about work.
Then finally got the legend that looked 46 years old at 26, insulted the disabled waiters - in one of those 'manned only by the disabled' cafés - within 5 minutes of sitting down, insulted me within 20 minutes of that, and blamed immigrants for him (poly dropout with no interest in upskilling, no side hustles, and clearly no ability to remove his foot from his mouth) earning $2k/month. WTAF?
Alamak. Men, take comfort that no matter how bad you think you might be, you're probably not stupid enough to insult the disabled waiters during a blind date.
I'm sure most SGean men are not like this, but the sheer amount of nonsense I have to filter through makes me want to give up and start looking into adopting a few cats. I'll be the crazy cat lady with a bottle of wine and a sick card collection that is singlehandedly paying a game store's rent, idgaf.

60480,106870,"Should I break up with him?
I have changed the story substantially to protect my identity but the advice will apply to my situation.
I met a guy during my first year. He was in his first year of medical school and I was in my first year of accounting. We hit it off right away. We shared similar tastes in food, in movies, in hobbies, we even took the same third-lang in secondary school. We've been dating for more than 8 years now. We don't fight, we always spend time together. Everything is better than I have ever imagined when it's just the two of us.
Recently we've been talking about marriage. It would have been a no-brainer for me to marry him were it not for this weird philosophy that he has about our responsibilities as spouses. He believes strongly that he is marrying me and not my family and likewise I am marrying him and not his family. According to him, I will be exempted of all my obligations to his family if I so want to be, and he should be given the same privilege. This, apparently, isn't just his idea. His whole family thinks this way, even his parents. His mom sat me down once to tell me that while I am always welcome, I will not be expected to do anything and she hopes I don't expect her son to do the same. One detail. Both his parents are doctors and they own and run a specialist clinic together. My dad is a taxi driver and my mom is a homemaker.
My mom and dad have been giving me pressure to soldier on with the marriage and they have indicated to me that they plan to ask for an obscene 5-figure amount in dowry and more than half of the banquet seats. His parents have also spoken to me and they said they will not be participating in any tradition, and all costs for the marriage will be borne 50/50. It's probably worth noting that my boyfriend's family do not celebrate any festivals (not Christmas, not CNY) and they are passionate atheists. I am pretty indifferent about my family's traditions but I don't know if I'm willing to get into a fight with my parents over what will come across as blatant disrespect. I also feel uneasy that my boyfriend does not believe in helping out with my duties to my family. One reason I want to marry is the fact that there are many challenges in life that are just easier to take on with help, most of these challenges involve my responsibilities to my family. I have a brother who is unfortunately autistic, and another brother who has a juvenile record and recently got a baby but refuses to work. He had this baby with a girl out of wedlock and now all of them are living in my parents' three-bedroom apartment. Most of the money I earn helps pay for all the problems that keep happening in my family. I don't like that I can't catch a break either. But it doesn't feel right to renegade on my family even when they are clearly suffocating.
I was fortunate enough to have had financial aid through the very elite schools that I grew up in. My friends are all from upper middle class families and I have spoken to them. Apparently they were quite uniform in their inability to support me on this issue because they also believe that it would be difficult for them to want to marry someone if they didn't first have assurances that their lives wouldn't be made more difficult post-marriage. In other words, most of them took the side of my boyfriend.
Am I the weird one to be expecting my future husband to share my burdens, however heavy they are? If I go through with this, I'm afraid of how ugly things can get with my boyfriend's family being of a completely different culture to mine. But if I do not, I don't know there is a guy out there that exists that I get along with while still being willing to support me.

60262,106407,"For the guys out there who have never been in a relationship or dating before, as a guy myself (25 yo, NUS alumni), I want to share on some important notes before you start dating or a relationship.
1) Actions from girls are more important than words. Yes, a girl may claim she misses you, text you good morning, say will bring you you to xxx, say will do xxx. If they are just saying without any actions done CONSISTENTLY, then it is just plainly talking.
2) Please don’t accept a relationship just because you are afraid to be alone or already in the so called “typical age range to get married” or most of your friends are attached. Rather to be alone than to be in a relationship/marriage suffering!!
Side track: according to book I read, the most important things in life for a guy are:
A) Health
B) Own savings
C) Family and Guy Besties (see girl is not in the list)
3) Watch out for her body language. If a girl CONSISTENTLY:
A) Keep her phone/phone screen away from you
B) Disallow you from using her phone
Explanation for A and B: she does that because she has something fishy to hide.
C) Never want to put your couple picture as her dp or post on social media or even discourage you to do so. Delete your couple photos on her phone.
Explanation for C: She considers herself to be in the “spinster” market. Means she is still looking around for her partner or even scared of people seeing you two together.
D) Always talk about herself and rarely entertain you
Explanation for D: One sided. She only want companionship. There should be give and take.
E) Always online on WhatsApp/Telegram but take 10000 years to reply your messages
No need to explain you should know why.
F) Say “none of your business”.
This is a major red flag. In a relationship, you all are supposed to work and listen together, not one don’t care about the other.
G) Don’t know what she wants in a relationship. Even after months.
H) Flirting and Cheating. When someone flirted and cheated although she has you, it means that your relationship is not that strong enough to begin and typically she will not suddenly change her heart overnight. So please do yourself a favour to distance away from her. Why tolerate someone like that?
I) Always texting a lot of male friends. Go to male friends’ house alone and not with a group of people.
J) Not willing to fork out money for meals/trips on YOU. If a girl is cash stripped because of her family situation (eg. Take care of family/pay loan/debt), it is understandable. Otherwise, the typical girl will always have more than money to spend on you on meals. Imagine a girl having difficulties parting with her money at the dating stage/while in a relationship, and imagine if you were to have kids with her, she definitely want you to spilt/pay for the hospital bills and baby accessories expenses. Would you ever want that?
Side note: a typical girl will chat with more than one guy online/in person. Please keep your eyes open and don’t put 100% heart into the relationship unless you feel reciprocated. Otherwise you will get hurt.
4) I suggest men to watch videos from Andrew Tate YouTube Channel (yes I am a fan of him). From his channel, I learned that a girl who truly wants to be with you would put 100% effort and her heart to be with you. She will be willing to spend money and time with you. No excuses. No mind games. You will be her priority other than her job.
Thanks for reading up to here :). I have been in the above situations blindly until I woke up finally. It has been very heartbreaking for me since I put my 100% heart into it. I cried a lot and felt depressed and I am recovering from it now. At least I am thankful for recognising it at the start of the relationship.
iykyk ;)

61118,108225,"I need to confess...
I met my wife 5 years back ago, when we were about to graduate. The first time I saw her, I told to myself ""She's the girl I want to marry. She's the girl I want by my side. She's the girl I want to protect."" But she was taken at that time.
A part of me felt so lost and wanted her so badly. A part of me felt I shouldn't disturb her and I should move on. I couldn't. So I stalked all her social media, be friends with her friends and got introduced as a ""mutual friend"". When we officially met for the first time, things were already not looking good between she and her boyfriend at the time. I took my chance to fill his spot and constantly gave her my support, my love. And eventually, she fell in love with as well. She decided to break it off with her then-boyfriend, although she didn't know I knew everything about her prior beforehand thus I was able to be the perfect listener for her. 
As we got together and with marriage coming into my mind but she was still not ready, I did a bold decision. I babytrapped her on purpose as I thought, ""with our kid, she will be with me forever. She will never leave me and she HAS TO marry me"". In the end she was furious when she got pregnant, but quickly let go of the issue as she thought we are both responsible. 
Flashback to now looking at our 3 years old daughter and her, she's still the same girl I want to take care for the rest of my life. Although we are financially stable and have a happy family right now while even waiting for our BTO, I feel so extremely guilty. I felt she will hate me, if she knew what really happened. I know I will probably take this secret to my grave, although I will have to carry this guilt for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry, but I love you too much. I know I was selfish, but I will spend the rest of my life making up to you.

Her father owns 80% of a listco in Malaysia. Yet, very humble (almost cheap) family. Her father drives a 20-year-old Camry and refuses to buy a new car before his current one breaks. He does go all out in certain things, particularly education of his children and real estate. She has a paid-off 3-room condo to her name in Holland Village that her father bought for her. My girlfriend is also cheap. She thinks traveling for leisure is a waste of money, thinks Starbucks is a waste of money etc. Every time I meet her she would find a way to say something is a waste of money. I don’t mind this I’m poor anyway, but I would like to elevate my standard of living and I would like to travel for leisure one day.
My impression is Singaporeans have no conflict with Malaysians because we’re essentially the same culture but I also know this girl and her family enough to say that they are nothing like ordinary Malaysians. They speak only English at home, no religion, and they believe strongly in independence of women. Her father has spoken to me about marriage and he wants me to know that for banquet and wedding expenses, I don’t have to worry because what can be halved will be halved and for banquet he will pay for his own guests and only his own guests.  
My family on the other hand is conservative and my mom is very “Chinese.” Still places importance in Chinese culture and wants grandchildren very much. My girlfriend’s family has pretty much abandoned their Chinese culture (they don’t celebrate CNY for example). She also has no plans to have children early or at all.
The children issue is perhaps the main source of friction but I am lukewarm about having kids as well so I think I’d be able to ignore my mom. Other than that, my trepidation is in the disparity of socioeconomic class, which I am not socialized well enough to understand the issues that it could bring.
Trying to get some last thoughts. Greatly appreciated.

61061,108105,"If I make 5k/month and my partner makes 25k/month, would it be fair to split all expenses 50-50? We are planning to get married next year and have many big expenses coming up eg wedding, renovations, honeymoon, car, kids etc. Partner insists we split all 50-50 but I disagree and am hoping to gain some perspective, no hate please.

60540,106981,"my (21m) gf (20f) just broke up with me last thursday, without saying a word. she just ghosted me, blocked me on whatsapp, telegram, and even my phone number when i tried to call her.
we had been together for 9 months. she was my very first gf, while she previously had 2 exes (recent one being 30yo), and 2 fwbs (recent one being 40yo) which came as a shock to me when i found out later, but i just chose to ignore her past.
things were going well for us the first few months, going on fun dates, texting until 4am everyday.. at that time, it really felt like she was a genuinely nice person, who was easy-going and fun to be with.
the 2 of us came from vastly different family backgrounds, with me being more well-off while her having to rent a room to live in with her divorced stepmother.
knowing this, i offered for her to move in with me in my room at my house for 3 months, as it would more conducive for her studies, which my parents agreed to.
the first few weeks of living together was fun, spending time and cuddling together everyday. i gave her all the love she needed, dry her hair, bathe her everyday, and even wash her bra and underwear together with her every week. other than these chores, i even helped her edit her assignments and reports for school.
over time, this became a norm, and she started taking these for granted, getting annoyed when i do not have the time to do those stuffs for her due to my own schoolwork piling up. i had no choice but to sacrifice some work and sleep just to do these for her. but it really felt like there was no appreciation for what i did.
as more weeks went by, more red flags started surfacing. she would complain to me when my parents cooks meal that she doesn't like, or get annoyed at me for not spending enough time with her when i have got assignments to complete, and many other small things which made me see her true self.
but even with all these, i chose to forgive and forget, hoping that she will become a better version of herself one day, hoping that this could really be a long-lasting relationship.
unfortunately, i was wrong. recently, we started to drift apart, texting less, hanging out less. despite all this, i still helped her edit her personal statements in her uni applications, hoping that i can make a difference in her future, or even OUR future.
less than a week after i finished editing her final application for her, she blocked me off completely without a goodbye. i tried to meet her at her home, but she just avoided me completely.
3 days ago, i went to her workplace, hoping for a proper talk to find some closure. i saw her with another guy. she had cheated on me, after all we have been through together for the past 9 months, without even a proper goodbye. that was my last time seeing her.
my first rs was such a shitty one. living together with someone can really help you see their true colours. i regret staying in this rs for so long, even after seeing all the red flags, genuinely hoping that some day she will change.
but i guess, some people never change. some people will never be grateful for what they have, until it's gone.
knowing that i really tried my best in providing everything for her, this breakup has hurt me so much that im not sure whether i would be capable of loving anyone else the same. i dont think i will ever be able to get over this completely. i feel used and thrown away like i meant nothing. whereever i go, our memories together would keep coming back.
what i learnt from this is: LEAVE before you get pulled even further into a hopeless rs. staying longer would just make it even more painful when it eventually ends..
