On Friday my mentor said he will treat me to lunch to celebrate my first week at the job; I agreed to the lunch but politely declined the treat, then suddenly he pulled off a Korean CEO move by cornering me into a wall and resting one hand on the wall, saying ""I don't take no for an answer. It's settled."" Unfortunately, his outstretched arm featured a ginormous ARMPIT STAIN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Not only that, on my first day when I passed a comment worrying about whether I will pass probation, he knocked his index finger against my forehand and was like, ""Silly girl. You have me."" He obviously didn't watch properly how they do it in kdramas, because instead of a light tap he Mike Tyson-ed it and my head literally snapped back and I muffled an ""OOF"". Laoniang had a blue-black for two days okay.
In case you were wondering, yes he wears his jacket with the collar turned up. Oh my god.

58807,103530,"tl;dr: I cheated with my female colleague and I feel very bad about it. What made it worse was that my wife witnessed the cheating…
I'm happily married with a wonderful wife with two kids. I work in marketing in an FMCG company and I'm constantly surrounded by younger female colleagues. Ngl, many of them are very attractive but I'm a faithful man who thinks with his bigger head.
However my life recently turned upside down. There's this female colleague who recently joined, let's call her G. G is in her late twenties and has a face and figure many women would die for and many men would go for. I was so surprised to find out that she was single (she gave me that information without me asking). G would constantly ask me for advice dealing with work matters and invite me to go lunch together with her batch. Sometimes we go for lunches and it's just the two of us. G would constantly ask me what I was doing over the weekend and tell me what her plans were. She was actively using dating apps but none of the guys were up to her standards. She would often flirt with me (I think?) Like when we are alone she would playfully brush my arms and sometimes bump into me (too often for it to be by accident). She’d also tell me about her experiences with her dates and how they're not good, and I'm so much better. I always felt a weird sensation whenever I hear that from her. It’s a nice feeling to be validated, but I’m married and it feels wrong.
One fateful day, as my wife had to use the car that day, she came to my office to pick me up. As I was walking away from the office with my wife, G somehow appeared out of nowhere and said hi to us and was extremely friendly towards my wife. G and my wife started chatting as if they were besties and they somehow ended up organizing a games night at my place that weekend. G said she’d bring her date over.
Fast forward to that day, G came with her date. Not sure why but I felt a tinge of jealousy seeing him. We decided to play some card games and I ended up partnering with G. This is when things went down. G was secretly texting me the cards she had in her hand and signaled me to read my phone. I got the hint and was trying to discreetly look at my phone. However, my wife caught me doing that and snatched my phone away and she saw the message from G. She acted like it was ok but after G and date left, she was so furious that I cheated with G during the games and my wife refuses to talk to me now.
How can I appease my wife?

57717,101452,"I am a 19F local dating a China guy with a really curious trait. Whenever he has trouble remembering how to pronounce cheem-sounding English words, he will transliterate it into Chinese and memorize that instead. For instance, ""s**ual intercourse"" becomes ""谁输儿 阴特扣死“ (shei-shu-er yin-te-kou-si), which I find so funny I make him say it every time he wants to do it.
But yesterday when I was helping him to spring-clean his room for CNY, I stumbled upon this army notebook of his. I recall that he told me as a second-gen PRC he had to serve, and he was a Platoon Sergeant, so I was curious and had a look at what he wrote. Lo and behold, it was full of Chinese transliterations of army commands and on one page, there was a full-blown Tang dynasty-esque poem:
扑了吞吐握右方 (pu-le-tun-tu-wo-you-fang)
扑了吞吐色迪呀 (pu-le-tun-tu-se-di-ya)
可可男露无乳撕 (ke-ke-nan-lu-wu-ru-si)

巴黎死色囊地利 (ba-li-si-se-nang-di-li)

58767,103458,"I have been dating my bf for a while but there are some points that I just cannot shrug off.
The expectation is that a guy should be at least a head taller than his girlfriend, but this is something that can only happen in my dream. The reason is he is only 2cm taller and not even 175cm, meaning that it feels like he is a sister/pal to me rather than an oppa. He is way too short for a guy and it doesnt give me a strong sense of security. I estimate he is in the lower tier of height range perhaps somewhere between 1.70-1.73m.
In fact, I would like to ask my fella ladies out there who are willing to date shorter guys or even marry them. What do you see in them? Dont you regret it after a while or will make this an issue whenever you start quarreling? There are plenty of bigger fishes out there and I am now starting to regret it.
Before you commentors start bashing me, I will be fair and point out some of his merits along with my concerns.
1. Yes, he is pretty good looking and has a nice heart. He often shows care for cats/dogs and feed them but I find this trait less manly and somewhat gross. A real man should be more aggressive, not like a beta sissy that plays with small animals.
2. He often buys lunch for me and brings it to the secondary school where I am teaching. However, sometimes kaypoh students will come to me and ask ""Cher, your boyfriend ah? Legit? Why so short one?""- Not surprising since even my female students are taller than him. This is ridiculously embarassing. I even told my bf not to bring lunch to me but he doesnt get my point... He will just say "" If we are truly in love, we shouldnt care what others say""..... Yeah right you are not the teacher...
3. He will offer to carry the plastic bags whenever we go shopping. The problem is his legs are short so his hands are like in close proximity to the ground, resulting in some long plastic bags being dragged, even though I understand he doesnt mean it. This is pretty unsightly.
4. He is a mathematician and I remembered once he drew me a heart using math equations. This seems romantic to others but lame in my eyes. If he is sincere, he would have drawn the heart by hand, not indulge in these kinds of boring stuff. After all, how can all these math help him in his future prospect? I knew of a few friends already earning big bucks without knowledge of maths.
I do not not wish to elaborate any further because for every merit that I can think of, it is diluted by the negative aspects. They cant even offset his midget stature.
Unfortunately, all the good quality tall guys are already taken by the short girls, otherwise I would have ended this relationship earlier. I do not want my female besties to find out that I broke up, so I will just bear with it for a while.
My message to my fella sisters out there who are currently attached to the shorter guys. It is never too late to back out! Think of your future!

58649,103251,"I've been together with my boyfriend for 3 years. Last year he graduated and found a job that pays him $3.5k a month. To be honest I was shocked that his salary is quite low. Because some of my friends and cousins are earning much higher than him. I often encouraged him to find a better job. I also asked him to take up some courses to improve his chances. He already took up a few courses but he still couldn't find a better job.
Recently, I was bored and downloaded a dating app for fun. Surprisingly, I matched with a lot of guys who seem quite eligible. I even matched with a lawyer and an investment associate. I have been chatting with the investment associate for two weeks now. He would text me only a few times a day because he's a very busy guy. Yesterday was his birthday so he told me he celebrated his birthday with his family at home.
After his birthday celebration, he suddenly said he wants to see me. At around 3am, he snuck out of his house and drove to my house to see me. I went down to the carpark to meet him and was quite surprised to see that he drives a luxury car and he looks even better in real life. We chatted for 2 hours in his car. He then walked me to the lift and even kissed me on my cheek. Although we barely know each other, I actually feel quite happy that he kissed me. When he reached home, he texted me to say that he enjoyed talking to me and he would like to see me again.
He seems like a really nice guy. I know I shouldn't compare but my bf isn't even that nice. And my bf is unable to find a decent job so I'm worried about my future when we get married. But my bf and I have been together for 3 years so our relationship is very stable. I feel like if I break up with him now, 3 years of my life would be wasted. What should I do? Should I just stick to my bf because he is obviously a safer choice? Or should I continue to go out with the investment guy and then break up with my bf when the investment guy confess to me?

57994,102001,"I’m having a physical affair with my helper. I know this is wrong but I don’t know what to do. This started mid last year and we both secretly get together whenever we are alone at home. I started developing feelings for her when once she helped me with a body massage. Things escalated from there and now I’m unable to stop myself. We click very well and i think there’s a big attraction between us.
We do keep our personal moments off from the family time. When it comes to her work and household chores she takes care of everything very well. She has never taken advantage of the situation and failed to work properly because of our affair.
The problem is i think my mum (staying with us) sensed something recently and ever since she has been insisting on sending our helper back home. She keeps finding fault with her which was not the case in the past. I really don’t want her to be sent back as this is not her fault. She has a family to feed back home and i feel very guilty.
But I can’t speak about this to anyone. I can’t even bring myself to ask my friends for advice. I’m also very worried that my mum might say something about this to my husband. Till date he hasn’t sensed anything and I didn’t deprive him of anything because of what i get with our helper. But I’m just very scared and worried. I still love my husband and i care for our helper too.

58900,103714,"I fell for a Siam bu.
Before u guys judge me, please hear me out. I often frequent Thai disco / Siam Diu as a means to de-stress. I find that the loud music and spinning lights help take the stress away from my work.
Like any other visit, I sat at my usual spot when a petite silhouette from afar caught my attention. Her round eyes, sharp nose, and elongated legs is what many would consider ""attractive"". Not to mention that her long and silky hair that is constantly brushing against her shoulder line; any man would subconsciously gravitate toward her and I was no exception.
I could not help but to glance in her direction without making it too obvious. I got caught eventually and we exchanged eye contact for a good 10 seconds. She understood the assignment and came over for a chat. As we began sharing more about each other, I realized that we have many things in common. We immediately clicked as though we had known each other right from the beginning. She introduced herself as ""Moon.""
At that moment, I felt as though I had found my soulmate. Talking to Moon made me forget about my fatigue from work. It was as though time had stopped. Deep down, I was sincerely hoping that the conversation could last forever. Time flew quickly, and before I knew it, the place was closing for the night. We exchanged contact and parted ways.
The next day, my phone rang. On answering, I was greeted by a familiar voice. It was Moon. My face lit up knowing that I could connect with her again. We agreed to meet up at a Thai restaurant called NaNa at Golden mille.
NaNa restaurant is a famous Thai restaurant in SG. Moon claimed to be a frequent patron of the place as their food tasted close to home. She even use the opportunity to teach me the name of the dishes in Thai. Halfway through our meal, she was rudely interrupted by a phone call which led her to leaving the restaurant. She claimed that she had something urgent to attend to, and needed to excuse herself. She sounded anxious.
Feeling concerned, I quickly paid the tab and followed her. I was soon led to one of the floor exits where I found her seated on the stairs and sobbing uncontrollably. I approached her to check on her. My presence caught her off guard and, almost immediately, she apologized for leaving me alone in the restaurant. She then went on to explain what happened. Turns out, her mom was terminally ill, and needed money for her operation. Sympathizing with her plight, I agreed to help her out without much hesitation.
As I was about to get up and make the withdrawal. She grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her. She gave me a peck on my cheek to express her gratitude. Things got heated up and we made love in a public space. Despite the shabby location, the sex was good and memorable. The day ended on a good note with her settling her family matters with my financial support.
That incident pulled us closer as we started hanging out more. Despite numerous warnings from my friends and family about her intention, I chose to believe her as I felt that the society perception towards hostress is based on stereotypes. Things, however, did get dubious when she started asking for more money...
P.S I realized the story is getting too lengthy and I apologized. I'll split the story and post the part two if the post hits 200 likes

My husband and I are both high level executives at tech companies. We both draw decent six-figure salaries and have a comfortable life. However, the way my husband runs our household makes me worry quite a lot. He runs the house as if it's a company, with goal setting, performance evaluation and what not. Some of the crazy things he has enforced on us:
- Bi-weekly sprint meetings and retros where we meet to discuss how far along we are in achieving in terms of our career growth, personal growth and fitness
- Quarterly OKRs for our son who is in Primary school
- He made our son set goals for his exam grades, e.g. 95 for English, 100 for Math, etc
- He created dashboards to track our combined income and expenditure, goal progress, etc
- Biannual performance review where we give each other feedback and he decides a rating for us. He will also give an overall family rating depending on our overall performance
- Our family holiday locations and the budget are determined by our family rating. The higher the rating, the better the location (ranging from Maldives to Sentosa)
- Every half, we do roadmapping and each of us have to also talk about how we envision ourselves and the family to be in the next few years and propose changes
I'm a bit afraid for my son that he's growing up in such a stressful environment and have an abnormal childhood. Will this be the case or am I worrying over nothing?

We didn't celebrate anniversaries, partly because he couldn't afford and always refused to have me pay for everything, but mostly as we didn't bother to remember the dates.

58851,103627,"My fiance has lost money on TerraLuna.
We have been saving up since secondary school. We have plans to BTO, raise beautiful kids and go on dream vacations. All these have come to a naught within a span of just a few days.
The idea of investing in cryptocurrency was first introduced to him by his circle of close friends. He was made to believe that he can make a quick buck and retire early. He took his friends words for it and dabbled into crypto trading.
There were occasions where he would boast to me that he had made a killing which would enable us to realize our dream quicker. Given the volatility of such investment, he assured me that he is well aware of the risk and persuaded me to join as well. Considering that his decision meant well for both of us, I decided to follow suit and entrust my life savings to him in hope that he will not disappoint me.
I should have known better not to do it when he began distancing himself from me and stayed silent on Whatsapp over the past few weeks. Being a concerned partner, I reached out to him to find out how he is doing and to check on our investment. When the topic of investment is raised, he would flare up for no reason and would shout at me over the phone.
A few days ago, a crypto-coin known as TerraLuna (or whatever they call it) made headlines for losing all of its value with allegations made against the founder for fraud.
Worried that it would impact our investment, I phoned my fiance but failed to reach him. I tried to dial his friend only to find out that he had put all his money in this so-called coin only to lose everything. Upon hearing the news, my heart sunk knowing that our hard-earned money were gone and our dreams destroyed. The last I heard about him was from his friend who told me that he had to resort to borrowing from loan sharks in hope to recover his losses only to end up losing more.
We have plans to hold our wedding in Dec which was made known to everyone early this year. Now we have to call it off because of his silly mistake. I can no longer see a future with him and I certainly do not see myself helping with his debt. Heck, I am even contemplating doing OnlyFans to re-build my wealth.
I am v lost as to what to do and how to break the news to everyone about our wedding dismissal should they question about it due to this incident.

57856,101703,"I read here about marriage proposals that went wrong - guys not putting in enough effort etc. But marriage is so much more than just a proposal... there are so many other factors to consider.
I will tell you after 21 years of marriage... don't marry unless you are very sure.
We went to pre-marital workshops talk about anything under the sun. Talking is easy.
Doing chores, having kids, and even having s** is difficult.
Firstly, we had never even gone travelling alone before marriage, never stayed together at all before marriage.
It's ok if both parties are serious about making it work..however sadly people change. I feel like I ended up getting a shock. My hubby has never cooked nor has ever done a day of chores in his life.
We didn't even know how to have s**. We needed to read books about it.
We didn't even know that we both have fertility issues. We took three years to have our first child with clomid and 6 years to have our kids via ivf.
And when it came to kids - the person who usually ends up giving up their job to take care of them is the women. So the hubby who had promised to have a joint account at the start of the marriage suddenly decided to have an individual account.
Suddenly you realise all the promises of your money is my money and my money is your money is all nonsense... he changed. Knowing he is the sole breadwinner, he decides how much to give you and he keeps his own account from you.
He bought his ""own car"", changed his job to do anything he wants as he has his own money.
Suddenly, after 21 years of marriage, you realised you had sacrificed so much for the family (inhections, iui, ivf) but your husband acts like a single man.
He enjoys playing with the kids, but disciplining them and managing their studies, their handphone usage, their meals... all lies on your shoulders.
He continues to game and does not help with chores. He even continues watching p*rn as if he was single.
Then you realised - why did you even marry in the first place?
The diamond, the promises that he will continue to love and protect you and do all the chores are just nothing but lies.
He just enjoys the fact that he has a family so he won't be lonely. But other than that, he continues his single lifestyle.
So ladies, please open your eyes big big... don't look at the proposal, don't look at the diamond, the bank account, the house, the car, the degree.
Know if he is the guy you can spend the rest of your life with. As he is now, not what you hope he will be.
We are usually maternal and might give up everything for our family.
If given another chance... I would rather wait till I find a more suitable guy who truly loves me and keeps the marriage vows, than someone who will only keep the vows if you don't disturb his gaming or interfere with his money.

We dated for 4 years before he proposed to me in August last year. A month later, he quit his job because he wanted to start a business with his friends. I then broke up with him as I felt very disappointed with his stupid start-up dreams. Fortunately I met someone new at my workplace who’s way more mature and financially stable than him so I managed to quickly move on.
So today he told me he would like to sell the engagement ring as he would like to expand his business. I asked him why bother selling this ring as it’s not that expensive anyway. He then said that this ring costs alot to him as he saved up for 2 years to buy it because he knew that it was my dream to own this ring. Playing the sympathy card. Yikes.
To be honest this ring is not really super expensive, at most $60k? So I don’t understand why he is so determined to take it back. I am seriously disgusted with how thick-skinned he is, how he tries so hard to convince me to return him the ring. Somemore he already know that it is my dream to own this ring.
But when I told my friends about this, they all told me I should return him the ring and support him in his start-up dream and then ask my current boyfriend to buy me a new one. Seriously how to support such stupid dream? So should I return him the ring or not? I have the right to reject him right?

To combat this, recently I have taken to frequenting nearby 7-11s after my workout, giving a free show of my topless sweaty body to any surrounding females. I even raise my arms in the pretense of stretching so that they can enjoy an unimpeded view of my erotic armpits, but even the cashier avoided my gaze.

For example, when he watches football on the couch and doesn't realize I am doing work on the table behind, he will slide his hand underneath his shorts and scratch his private parts, before bringing said hand up to his nose and taking a deep, invigorating breath, as if one were doing meditation.
Other times, the scratching results in some dirt that he rubs between his thumb and forefinger into a little grey ball of death, which he EATS. Lastly, sometimes the scratching dislodges a strand of pubic hair, which he examines with keen interest in the same way David Attenborough looks at insects on plants, before sucking on it.
I have gone down on him many times and I can assure yall that it is not Bengawan Solo down there. So why is he smelling, eating and sucking on by-products of his nether region? Do all guys do these?? How do yall cope with this disgusting side of your husbands/bfs???

58648,103256,"My girlfriend and I met in the first year of uni. when I first lay my eyes on her, I knew she was the one. However, there was only one problem: she was attached. But I was going to overcome this hurdle nonetheless, afterall we were studying in an overseas uni and her boyfriend was in the army. I knew I could come in between their LDR - it was just a matter of time.
In addition, I knew i had a height advantage - I was 190cm and he was only 172cm. I feel like my looks are above average as well so I think that helped me in a way. On a normal day, I would ask when she was going to call her boyfriend so I could give her time and space. But in my heart I secretly wanted her all for myself.
I waited patiently, for my time to strike. It had been a few weeks now and I thought about how to disrupt their daily calls as they were still going strong. Thus, I had to purposely ask her to go for random courses and classes in the evening, as that was the only time she could call her boyfriend (due to the time difference between singapore and UK). Slowly but steadily, she started to reschedule or even cancel the calls with her boyfriend - to my pleasure.
She slowly grew attached to me, and told me some heartfelt thoughts like how she felt distant with her boyfriend. She asked me for advice of what to do and obviously I had to sow discord between them and even made her doubt their relationship.
In addition, I used a fake instagram account that I bought online to mask myself as some ex classmate of hers (let's call her Jane) and saying things like how her bf was cheating on her. Finally, the turning point in their relationship came. The LDR, constant fights and distrust became too hard to bear. They broke up and she naturally came falling into my arms.
I feel bad and actually guilty for doing such things thats why I'm writing this confession. My question to you guys is that if you were in my shoes, what would you do for love? what boundaries would you break and what morals would you shatter - to attain this entity we call love?
TLDR: Just because there is a goalkeeper, dosent mean you cannot score a goal. I hope this story inspires people out there whose crushes are attached, where I want you guys to know that nothing is impossible, just follow your dreams.

57426,100814,"Do you ever think about your ex partner and wonder how they're doing?
For the record, I'm happily married, with a beautiful baby girl. My husband is loving, everything I could have ever wished for. My life is complete, beyond my dreams and I'm really grateful..
But today, while putting my baby girl to sleep, I suddenly realized that it must have been roughly 10 years since my first boyfriend had broken up with me. (My husband is my second)
I started to wonder how this first guy is. Not in a romantic kind of way but genuine concern as someone who had known him very well in the past.
You see, he's not a bad guy. At all. He just has all the bad luck. And I do wonder how he is from time to time, though I've no desire to get in contact. I genuinely hope things have looked up for him since.
The circumstances of our breakup was dramatic, though it was none of our fault. He's just plain unlucky.
We had been together about 5 years, throughout university, but he broke up with me the first year after we graduated and started working.
The following can probably be written into a mediacorp drama:
His family had always been fraught with problems. They're a working class family, with total of 4 brothers. He is no. 2. They could have had a good, middle class life but his father gambled to the point of having loanshark come to the house and to the office, causing him to lose his job.
Then his parents divorced, selling the flat to split assets. His father then became homeless, and my then boyfriend who was still in uni, had to fork out few hundreds a month from his part time tuition income to rent a bed for his dad.
I pitied him having to support his dad while the rest of his family moved to a HDB rental flat. By this time the other brothers had stopped contact with his dad, only my ex boyfriend was supporting him.
Wanting to save on university fees, he deliberately loaded on more modules so he could graduate a semester earlier and go to work to earn money to support his dad and family, with 2 younger brothers who were still schooling.
The last straw came one day when I was at work. By that time I had just started working a few months, so he could have been working for a year already.
I still remember I received a text from him, asking to meet me that night after work. I had period cramps and really wanted to go home to rest so I asked if we could meet another night. But no, he had something urgent to tell me. So we met at my void deck.
I still remember that night. He sat me down and told me everything...
He wanted to break up with me. Because his youngest brother, then in sec 3, had been kicked out of school for failing to turn up for the retake of his end of year exam. Yes, so he had failed once and had been retained. The school gave him another chance to come back for re-exam but in between, he had gone to lion dance, fallen and broken his collar bone, meaning he couldn't take the re exam since he couldn't write. So the school had called to kick him out. That was the last straw for my ex bf as his problems seemed unending and which led to his decision to break up with me.
Incredulous? The whole situation was incredulous to me. I cried and cried and cried. I didn't understand why it was me who had to suffer a break up when we both agreed I wasn't a problem to him.
He then told me everything else. He said he didn't want to burden me with all his family's problems so he had kept alot of the severity of the problems to himself.
But during the break up, he came clean and told me everything that had been plaguing him.
By that time, I hadn't seen his eldest brother for months. I did ask, but my then bf just made excuses. Only during the break up did he tell me that his elder brother had been caught taking drugs and had been either in jail or rehab (I can't rmb). I was shocked and so pained for him. This meant that he could no longer continue to work in insurance after his release, and the burden on my ex bf to support the family became even heavier.
He also told me, when his parents divorced and sold the flat, they split proceeds, and his dad went uncontactable for a week, apparently he had gone to Batam to gamble and came back after he lost heavily or most of it.
So yeap up until that point, I had been blissfully unaware of the severity of his family's problems and only knew that they divorced due to his gambling problem and that only my ex bf was supporting his dad by renting a bed space for him to stay.
I was stunned. And sad. We had talked about BTO, visited the show flat, discussed applying for the one at AMK etc. Everybody including me, thought we would end up together because that's just how we were.
And then as I sat crying and wailing, he told me he decided to break up with me because I was always a happy girl and he didn't want to burden me with his problems. So he didn't tell me alot of these things that plagued him. But when he had to meet me, he had to put up a happy front and he didn't want to anymore.
I was bewildered because yes im sheltered, but I'm not unhelpful or uncaring. I didn't understand why he had to hide his problems from me.
When his dad was homeless, I even suggested he move in with my own dad so as to save on rent.
My parents were and are separated, my dad stays alone in a house. So there was room for his dad. He did move in, but my dad is not easy-going. He has OCD and is very x100 naggy. So anyway, things didn't work out between the dads and his dad had a fall in the house and was warded and later diagnosed with kidney failure and needed dialysis.
Anyway so we broke up that night but I was distraught and kept pestering him, stalking him at his house and workplace to force him to speak to me. I even contemplated jumping off his block, while sitting on the stairs in between knocking on his door for him to speak to me.
Eventually he told me, please stop knocking on my door. I feel very stressed, it reminds me of times when the loanshark came to our house.
It took me more than a year, and a few months of severe pimple outbreak before I got over the heartbreak. I had pimple outbreak from excessively crying, it dried out my face or caused some hormonal changes and at age 25, I had my first outbreak.
My turning point came when I was overseas with a group of girl friends doing community work. After activities one day, they took us out fishing for lala in the river. It was evening time. As I floated lazily down the river, I looked up and suddenly saw that the sky was round. I can't put it in words, but the sky was so vast and clear.. clouds dotted the sky. I could see it was indeed round. And I thought to myself: The world is so big, there's still so many things I haven't seen and done, so many things waiting for me..
In that moment, I was filled with hope and excitement for the future and stopped looking back on my past. It took another few months for my pimples to die down.. I discovered the vegetarian diet helped calm my hormones and pimples down.
My healing really came after this river trip. I started doing alot of things on my own, like cycling from ECP to Changi Point or Barrage every weekend. Going to swim 20 laps. All on my own. It was very empowering because I had never been a very independent person.
And then about a year after the break up, my colleagues encouraged me to start dating again. They told me about online dating. Actually my director was the one who told me about it. That's where he met his wife. So I did, and then I met my future husband. We dated for 2 years and have been married for 5 years now.
Anyway, I am just writing to put this on the internet, and putting it out there that I hope this first guy is well and found someone he deserves. I hope things have gone better for him and his family and I sincerely wish them the very best. I keep him in my thoughts quite frequently, like once every few months I would wonder if he's ok.
I mean, after all he has been through, I hope god is treating him better now.
Oh, actually we did meet about 2 years after the breakup. Purely by coincidence. My grandma had been warded in hospital and so was his dad. My cousins bumped into him and told him about grandma, who he also knew. So he messaged me after that to ask her condition. That's the first time we spoke after so long, I was already dating my husband. Anyway long story short, his dad passed away from kidney failure shortly after and I also visited his funeral. I felt really guilty at that time because I had blamed our breakup on his dad too. Anyway that was the last time we spoke.
End of story, it was long.

I thought women at her age passed child bearing, so I dared to do it. Now I regretted because she told me she was pregnant after a month plus later. I suggested her to go for abortion because I am not ready to start a family, and since she is older than me, she should be able to pay for the abortion. She got angry with me and stopped contacting me thereafter.
I got to know a few days ago she didn’t go for abortion, and she is pregnant with my twins.
What shall I do? To get back in touch with her again? I still not ready to start a family, especially with a woman much older than me.

I had emphasized many times to her Pokémon cards are a form of investment just like how people are crazy over NFTs.
She just can’t seem to accept it.
To provide some context, i was previously a loner with no friends. I had only my Pokémon cards to provide me accompany.
She complains that I am always going back to the mall, spending hours at the card shop looking at Pokémon cards and spending excessive amount of time online.
She calls it a fetish.

58965,103843,"To OP #103823 I was like you 25 years ago and truly understand what is like living paycheck to paycheck.
I gave up my poly study at year 2 and work as a teller cos I couldn’t bear my younger brothers being affected my my family situation and they couldn’t concentrate on their studies. So I chose to work to support my parents and siblings.
No one will understand how it is like when your friends need not bat an eyelid on Starbucks but you have to refund EZ-Link card to use the money to buy dinner for the family cos your payday is on the next day and will credit in midnight.
My husband (back then still boyfriend) never once say anything or complain. But he was equally poor???? staying in an one-room rented flat. We saved every single cent, dates were usually at hawkers or foodcourt. We held our wedding dinner at a Chinese restaurant and even ‘earn’ back our dinner cost with money for overseas honeymoon.
Now with 2 kids and staying comfortably in a 4-room HDB flat, combined income still below $10k, we never once feel ‘inferior’ as compared to our peers. We are ‘debt free’ as our cpf have surplus to cover the housing loan monthly. We have no car, no condo, restaurant meals seldom exceeded $80 for fam of 4 but we are contented.
Our nights are spent chasing dramas on the bed, no drinking at pubs, no cafe hopping as all these are $$$$ and $$$. Kids during their free time, play bubble guns at the corridor, Nintendo switch and mobile games. All these activities really no need much money but still keep us occupied.
Guess god ‘compensate’ my hard life by giving me a good husband albeit we are defined as ‘poor’ in today’s context. So the question you really have to ask yourself is whether u love your boyfriend and if he is the right person who you can depend on for the next 30 years. Some may have the rich boyfriend/hubby but still unhappiness over 3rd party or debt issues.
Life is short, don’t think so much if he is really good.

57879,101745,"I am married twice and I have learnt so much about maintaining a marriage from a woman's POV.
1st marriage, I was young and over zealous about being a good wife and living a good marriage. We were a horrible match, but I believed I could make it work. There was always a need to prove to everyone that I made the right choice.
I did everything that social media would deem as the perfect woman - including cook, clean, work, bring home money, plan, love his family, do home improvement projects, romance the husband, keep up with the s** and whatever you can think of. Eventually I got burnt out and he took me for granted. Can I blame him? Yes but I am also to blame because I made him into who he is.
He hated my guts because I was so good. He criticised me because he hated the compliments I got. He hated it when I see his friends because I stole his limelight. He didn't need to do anything because his wife could do everything. In my POV, I was just trying to be the best for him but in his POV, I was putting him down in every way. So like most marriage tragedies, he cheated on me with a woman who was so ordinary, so ordinary that it opened my eyes completely. I had been working blindly to become what I thought is a good woman - but was it for him? Or was it just for my own ego? I went through a phase of blaming and hating on him because I was self righteous about being the best - and yet I was hurt so badly. But now I am thankful because that failed marriage has taught me so much.
My current marriage made me realise that if you meet the right person, you don't even need to try so hard or work so hard. We know each other's strengths and we give each other space. Of course we have days when we are just pissed at each other but we choose our battles. I have the brains and he has the muscles so I do most of family and kids planning while he does the physical labor like cleaning and fixing. He will play his games and watch his sports but still be responsible for the chores at home. I go out partying with my girlfriends but still return home to be a good partner the next day. We respect each other's activities and hobbies. We are always verbal about our appreciation for one another. It is harmonious and great for the kids because I see them growing up being good people.
The biggest lesson I learnt is that - if you have issues with a man before marriage, don't marry him, wait for the one who makes you feel good about yourself and brings out the best of you. The right man will not hurt you and will appreciate you for what you have. It will hurt him to hurt you. You don't have to try to make things work, it will just work. When you realise you are trying too hard, something is very wrong!

58980,103870,"Some people would hate me for sharing this. I am a slim girl naturally well-endowed with huge boobs. For Chinese girls, those with skinny limbs, small hips and flat stomach usually have flat or small chests. To give you some perspective, it is a 36C. And I am only 162cm and 48kg.
I'll be honest... I do enjoy the attention. Sometimes, I wear push-ups and straighten my back to make my assets more obvious. Other times, I don't even wear a bra, and even though it doesn't look as big, the nips are visible. I am proud of it, and I like to low-key show off, though I never say it out loud. Sometimes, I even unbutton the top 2 buttons of my shirt or angle my posture such that people can get a sneak peek of my bare breasts through an opening in my shirt. I know this sounds really perverted and twisted af, but I think I might be an exhibitionist. I hope you don't judge me.
I know that many girls are jealous and many guys fantasize about me - and I have caught many staring, including teachers and dads of my friends. It gives me a devilish kind of happiness when I hear that my boobs are the talk of the town. I'm sorry if you feel like telling me off at this point. But this is me.
But recently, for the first time in 24 years, I felt sad after wondering if having huge boobs is the only thing that I will ever be known for. And I feel empty.
What happened was this: I just broke up with my ex-bf over text for personal reasons, and he was really upset. I understand why he was angry, but I could not have anticipated the stuffs that happened later. Out of spite, he revealed that the only thing he wanted in the relationship was to get access to my boobs and describe them to his guy friends. Nothing about my ""bitch character"" attracted him, it was only about the sex. He even told me that his guy friends had all seen my nudes that he took, and I was just a conquest for him to show off his exploits. Wtf right. What an asshole. To verify, I asked a mutual friend who was in that gang, and he admitted after me probing for some time that he showed them those private photos on his phone but never sent them electronically. I had never felt more offended and insulted in my life. I remember I was so angry that I was screaming my head off in my room and throwing and breaking things, and my sister almost wanted to tie me up. I let this douchebag take my virginity, use me to fulfil all his deviant fantasies and I had only ever given myself to him and nobody else in my entire freaking life! And he just bloody treated it like it meant nothing to him! I was so furious that I even entertained the idea of hooking up with his brother or his boss, who is a friend of mine, just to get back at him. I actually sent out a video message saying ""Hey, want to hook up I really want this"", but recalled it shortly after thank goodness for Telegram's recall function. Eventually, common sense got the better of me and I didn't end up doing anything rash. Now, I still feel angry enough to feel shortness of breath every time I think about this, but at least I am rational enough not to do something I'll regret.
Now that I am here, I want to ask. How do I filter out the guys who are only after my boobs? How can I give people the impression that I am more than just my body parts? I can't be wearing oversized tees all the time, and I love my girly wardrobe. Also, I am a young woman, and I still want to flaunt it a little and feel sexy. In a way, I do have to show off cos I sometimes get paid to advertise stuffs on my public IG and TikTok account. Is there a way to find a balance? If yes, how to achieve it?

57387,100670,"My boyfriend is bi and his exes were all guys. I'm aware and don't have any issues with his sexuality.
Recently I got to know one of his close friends and he briefly shared that my boyfriend was the bottom in all his relationships and hook ups. I thought he was kidding but he laughed it off and said I can ask my boyfriend if I don't believe.
I'm a bit thrown off as my boyfriend looks like the top in a gay relationship instead. He's tall, fit, tanned and is quite well endowed down there.
I didn't ask him directly initially and snooped around his room when I stayed over. While rummaging through belongings, I found his d**do and it's bigger than mine... wtf.
I confronted him about the d**do and asked him about his bottom status and he didn't even deny. He said he likes the feeling from receiving and uses the d**do now for his own pleasure now that he's attached with me. He even clarified that's where the male g spot is and there's nothing to be ashamed receiving pleasure from there. The only taboo is straight people might see it as gay, which he emphasises is not as it's an anatomy thing.
He also reassured me that he enjoys s** with me and has never betrayed me with any guys. I trust him on this.
I tried to move pass all of this but it's challenging, especially when we have s**. I will imagine him being penetrated and dominated and I just lose all my interest in s**with him. I just cannot unsee and unhear that he's a bottom.
My sub conscious self also tells me that he's less manly and can't provide me with the security I need. I know it's selfish of me to think this way but I can't help it.

He was very clear about this and wanted me to understand before we continue. At that time he also suggested that we get a place together.

I felt I was very much in love with him that a part of me believe I can forsake marriage as long as we are happy together. Besides I dislike children myself.
We are not married but we lived like a married couple. We cook for each other, did chores, managed the bills, visited each other's parents and we did everything together. I thought we had the perfect life. We lived like we are married and yet we have the time to date each other. I was envied by friends who witnessed our love. He still buys me flowers and gifts on special days like anniversaries, after being together for 10 years.
The final few months of our relationship I sensed his increasing distance. I convinced myself we are just busy with work and other things. He was out more, he stopped telling me about his day. It got to a point I felt we were like roommates living under the same roof. Then he told me he met someone. He needed me to move out because the other woman wants to move in.
I haven't had time to compose myself and react to this utter betrayal and I had to pack up. 10 years meant nothing to him?.. I moved back to my parents and lied to them that his place is under construction.
I haven't even had time to process my anger and grief then I heard he had a vehicle accident. His parents wasn't aware that we broke up so I was called first. I found out he was severely injured that his life won't be the same forever. The other woman didn't hesitate to dump him after seeing his condition.
Since his parents didn't know we had broken up, I choose to pretend I'm still his gf and stayed with him at the hospital. I took over most of the caregivers job because he was so helpless. I stayed over at his place often and took care of him for a while. He couldn't carry on with his current job anymore so he had to settle for a simpler job which pays lesser. The lucky thing is he had almost paid off the house so he didn't need to downgrade.
He had been needy towards me since the accident. I can understand that. How can I not feel for him? We did have a lot of happy times till this happened. I continued being there for him as he needed a lot of help and support. One day he asked me if I wanted to get married. I realised this was what I wanted all along. But not like this. I said no and realised it is time to leave him. I didn't want to take care of him anymore. So I left.
Now, I'm already past the age of having kids safely. I did try to move on. I tried to date but without much success. I met 2 who were quite persistent in chasing me. But none interest me or can even compare to him. I've got my own place during the time I was taking care of him. I think a part of me already know I won't get back together with him. I just needed a push to move on with my own life. Did I regret not getting married when I was younger? Definitely. I may have lived a very different life if I walked away the moment he told me he is not marriage material. If he cheated while we are married maybe he wouldn't have got hurt because I may not have moved out so easily.
Without a marriage certificate, it's very easy to walk away when things happen. So what kind of a person did I wanted to be? One who walks away or one who stays because of a piece of paper?

57295,100431,"My gf and I have been together for nearly 3 years now.
We met in an orientation camp during our first year and I am 3 years older than her. She is from Malaysia and does not have much friends here so she spend most of the time hanging out with me. She isn’t exactly the “goddess” kind of girl. She is the girl-next-door type that you will easily fall in love with. Good-natured, cheerful and sweet. She smiles a lot. She is tall for a girl, at 174cm (I am only 178cm) and very slim. She is tan as she likes to swim. She wear her hair in a simple bob at chin length (till recently), which she trim once it touches her shoulder. She told me she keep the same hairstyle since primary school. She dress simple, T-shirts and shorts most of the time, or T-shirt and Jeans if attending class. She doesn’t put on makeup.
I like her a lot because she is very understanding and doesn’t have high expectation (of me). Unlike my exs, she does not expects nice and expensive gift from me. Sometimes she cook and pack lunch for me. She really cook well. She never complaint that I play computer game a lot, and she sit quietly at the side when I was having a game of basketball with my friend. She doesn’t go clubbing but she never complain a single time when I went clubbing with my buddy without her. She never flare up and never a harsh word to me. She don’t expect me to do anything for her and will even volunteer to help me run my errand.
At the start of this year, she start visiting me at home during weekends, and she will stay for dinner. My mother likes her because she is very polite, help in the house chores and she help makes dinner whenever she was here. Then one time, it getting quite late and my mother ask her to stay for the night. From then on, she stay over every weekend. We start to have sex. Surprisingly she is very active, unlike the demure self in the day. I can’t help but notice how skinny she is, and wish that she can put on a little more weight.
So every weekend, we live just like any young couple, study, watch Netflix, going to buy groceries, meals, sex etc nothing special. But I felt blissful.
Then something changed a month ago. She always followed me to the malay barbershop downstairs, and wait for me to get my haircut. But this time, she wants to cut her hair too, I was surprise and told her I can bring her to a nice salon. She said its ok as it here cheaper here, and moreover she want a shorter cut which normal salon don’t do good. So I watched helplessly as the barber cut a good 10cm of her hair to a boyish cut that revealed her ears. If it was cut in a salon, it will pass off as a pixie cut, maybe more feminine. I don’t like it and told her to grow her hair long. She just smile. My family members are surprised by her haircut too. But my mother was all praise at how sweet she look even with such short hair. I can’t believe my mother actually encourage her.
Anyway, after this incident, I become conscious of how Tomboy she look and dress. I get annoyed when my female friend teased that she looked great and will fall in love with her.
So the last straw. Last week I went for my monthly haircut, she said she wanted a trim as well. I told her No as she supposed to grow her hair long. She said just a trim as the hair at the ear is sticking out and keep persuading me. Finally I agreed. So after my haircut, she sat down on the same chair. She converse with the Encik in malay for quite a while and the cape was put on. To my horror, the barber start to use a clipper and dig deep onto her nape and high onto the back of her head. I exclaimed that it shouldn’t be this short. My gf however assured the barber it’s ok and urge him to continue. I get really angry with each pass of the clipper. The final cut is a neat man haircut with closely clipper side and back. The top is no more than 5cm and well combed. My gf can easily pass off as an army regular anytime. I was so angry I cursed at her. I keep silence the world day without speaking to her. At night, seeing that I am still angry, she offer to have sex with me. While we are at it, I can’t help but keep seeing the closely clipper part of her head. It feels weird on my hand and I lost interest. I feel like I am having sex with a man.
It’s been a week since I avoid her. I know its only hair and it will grow, I should not be petty as a man. Moreover she is such a wonderful girl. But she lost all her attraction to me and I can’t kick away the feeling that I am dating a man.
I know I am the jerk to be thinking this way. I am blessed with such a wonderful girl as my gf, but at times I really wished that she is more curvy and well-endowed; and doll up a little.

59036,104015,"This is my mid-career switch experience from teaching to software engineering. If you are thinking of doing the same, I hope my post would help you in some ways. Long story ahead.
I graduated from NIE with a bachelor in arts degree and was bonded to MOE for four years. During my four years of teaching, I gave my all and was performing above average. However, I always knew I wanted to try something else besides teaching. At that time, I didn't know what the alternative was but I just couldn't see myself in teaching for the rest of my life. Towards the end of my four years bond, I wrote my resume and applied to various job adverts on LinkedIn. I was lucky as one of the companies replied me. While I didn't have the necessary skills they needed, I promoted myself as someone willing to learn and keened to work for the company. I was prepared to take a pay cut as I knew I was starting from scratch again. I settled for a 40% pay cut for this new job.
Unfortunately, things didn't work out well for me as I found the job to be rather mundane. I knew I wouldn't get anywhere with the skills from this job and decided to cut loss by ending my employment with the company at the end of my probation period.
The good thing that came out of this was I realized I wanted to work in an environment where there would be minimal face-to-face interaction and it should be stimulating enough for me. During that period, SkillsFuture was encouraging people to join the IT industry and they were promoting this professional conversion programme for mid-career switchers to train them in IT programming. I decided to go for it. At the same time, I made use of my $500 skillsfuture credit to purchase programming courses on Udemy and continued with my learning at home.
To be honest, the courses provided by the training institute were insufficient. I was expected to learn OOP, MVC programming in 5 days, which was just impossible for someone like me without any programming background. But I was determined to figure it out. So when I was not in class, I would be following my Udemy instructor and learning on my own. The entire conversion programme took around 6 months. I updated my resume with a few mini projects I did and began my job search process. In total, I applied to close to 100 job applications and only heard back from 4 of them. I still remember the agony I went through to this day. You must understand teachers have it easy when it comes to getting a job. Our jobs were handed to us even before we graduated. We didn't have to go through this excruciating job searching process and I was jobless for more than half a year. All the self-doubt, anxiousness and negative thoughts were just eating me up every night. While waiting to hear back from the companies, I practised my interviewing skills, did leetcode, continued with my Udemy courses and prayed. I also gave part-time tuition during this period to help with my daily expenses.
After being unemployed for more than 7 months, my breakthrough came. My friend referred me to their company's HR internally. I was given an opportunity to do an online technical test which I passed and was subsequently interviewed by the project manager and MD. What helped was the mini projects I did and knowing the basics of OOP. They extended an offer to me and this ended my 8 months drought. I was drawing a fresh grad pay. It was 20% higher than my last drawn pay. While it was still lower than what I was last drawing in teaching, the opportunity to work and learn in this industry was more important than the salary. I knew I had to be humble and learn from my colleagues who were all younger than me.
The learning curve was steep but I enjoyed every part of it. I'm coming to 3 years in this industry and in these 3 years, I attained two cloud solutions architect associate certifications and was promoted to a senior position. I burnt many nights and weekends away studying and upskilling myself in new technologies.
Looking back, leaving teaching was a leap of faith. With a degree in arts and four years of work experience only in teaching, it was really difficult to find something comparable in the commercial sector. To those who are thinking of leaving teaching or even joining the IT industry, I would advise that you try out those programming courses on Udemy first during after office hours and weekends. It'll minimally take you 3 months to figure out what you are doing. But you must persevere. Rewatch the videos until you get it. Figure out if this is for you. Most of the udemy courses will teach you by building projects. Make changes to those projects and customize them so that you can show them in your resume. If you plan to go for the diplomas or certifications provided by higher-level institutes, make sure you have enough savings to do so. Even if you don't plan to, you should also make sure you have enough savings for your expenses in case you need to settle for a pay cut. Those in teaching, at least leave after you've collected your 4 years connect plan.
I got headhunted by another company during this recent tech hiring spree with a happy increment. I'm now drawing a salary higher than what I would be getting if I were to stay in teaching. Most importantly, I'm doing something I can see myself doing till my retirement. Was it scary? You bet. But I grew so much in these three years when I chose to leave my comfort zone and I'm glad I made that decision 4 years ago. Oh, and not to forget the benefits of working from home.
To those who choose to stay in teaching, I have nothing but admiration for all of you. The working hours are tough and there is no such thing as work-life balance. You are a teacher to your students 24/7. Thank you! To those who need a way out, maybe this could be an option for you to consider. All the best!

58963,103838,"I am the author of https://www.facebook.com/695707917166339/posts/7449352511801812/. I honestly did not expect the post to blow up as I'm afraid that my story would come across as your typical story about SG men getting con by Thai women.
However, like many have predicted, there is indeed more to the story as Moon's dubious behavior marks the start of unraveling her true identity.
Her repeated plea for cash sparked my curiosity about her family. When probed further, she would brush me off and assured me that they are doing fine thanks to me. She would often use suggestive language as a form of diversion. Succumbed to lust, I fell into her trap leaving my suspicion lingering.
The truth is that the sex was so good that it left a strong impression on me. The crescent moon tattooed on her left arm turns me on every time we meet. We made love in various places ranging from high-end hotels like MBS to public areas like changing rooms. As soon as we set foot on our destination, we began undressing and demonstrating our affection for each other. Before we knew it, we were lying next to each other panting and exhausted. Every session ends with her whispering something to my ears to get me aroused for our next meetup. Words cannot describe how amazing the experience was.
However, good times do not last forever, and Moon was no exception. She started replying less, using busy as an excuse to avoid my calls. It eventually came to a point where I got completely ignored, driving me anxious.
I headed back to the Thai disco in search of an answer. After speaking with the manager, I came to discover that she is on a short-term visa. It was added that her recent attempt to extend her stay was denied and she is unlikely to return anytime soon. I was devastated.
Just when I thought I had lost all hope of seeing Moon again, the manager suggested trying my luck with Facebook. As they were mutual friends, he shared her FB profile with me and I began browsing through her posts.
Her public gallery revealed multiple photos of a young chap in his everyday life. What drew my attention was a tattoo that was identical to Moon on the exact same spot. It had me thinking that perhaps this person is a close contact of hers, possibly her sibling, child or even husband.
I took my questions to the manager for clarification. I got a rude shock. The person in the photo was, in fact, Moon before her gender reassignment. She used to be a male back then.
Embarrassed and frustrated, I cooped up in my room for several weeks refusing to see anyone. I questioned my sanity on whether our exchange was an outright lie from the beginning. Was all of this a scheme to con my money? I guess I will never know as she remained unreachable till today. Neither do I intend to investigate further as it will only adds to the disappointment. Things ended unanimously between us leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.
Apologize if my encounter did not turn out to be as dramatic as what many perceived to be. The intention is not to seek advice but to share about my past. I was originally hesitant to continue but was encouraged by the community. The overwhelming response is what drives confessors like me to continue posting. I hope u guys had fun listening to my story and I'll catch everyone in my next confession. Till next time.

58152,102327,"Does anyone know whether marriage counselling includes s*xual counselling? My husband has recently gotten obsessed with Japanese and Korean AV actresses, and he has been making me help bring his fantasies into real life. For the past weeks, he has put a frigging Straits Times newspaper in front of me and made me read it every time we do it.
Then, when he climaxes, instead of the usual exclamations that everyone uses, he goes for ""OPPA GANGNAM STYLE!"" which, I assure you, turns off every single female on this planet during intercourse. Worst of all, just now, my 10-year-old girl said to me, ""I only didn't interrupt because I want a brother. But that was some weird shit I heard.""

58970,103850,"Have been with my bf for 2.5 years, met through Tinder. Both of us were in uni when we first met and joined the workforce 1.5 year ago. He got promoted to a senior role and started getting really busy with work over the last 5 months. Our meetups were often shortened to just 2-3 hrs a week for a quick meal and catchup, to give him enough time for rest and to spend with his family over the weekends. We missed out celebrating for valentines day, mother's day and my dad's birthday during that entire period due to his busy schedule. My bf has always said sorry for not spending enough time with me multiple times every week and made promises to meet up with me more often.
His project has just ended and I was looking forward to meeting him more as his workload would hve reduced significantly. However, instead of making time out for me, he went ahead to fill his schedule for this entire week with meeting his friends for dinner and drinks, leaving the same 3 hr timeslot for me on a saturday afternoon.
I asked if he will be free next week but he say he will be starting on another project next week and will be back having overtime and a really busy schedule so he is unable to make time out to meet me. Yesterday, I saw a notification from his female friend saying 17 June would be a better date for dinner and out of curiosity, i opened the message. I realised he asked her for a catchup next week as he is free the entire week and gave all the evenings as available options to cater to her schedule. He also offered to send her home after the meal since it would be late (around 9-10+pm) and he wanted to watch out for her safety.
I confronted him about it but he turned it into an issue of me looking into his messages without his consent, which I then apologised. He mentioned that it is an old friend and he havent met her in 6 months hence he wanted to set aside some time to meet her. Sending her home would be a given as he has a car and he wouldn't have to make much of a detour to return back home after that. I tried asking why he seemed very available to meet her and his other friends but not me, and all he ever did was to make it as if I am the one demanding too much from him. He said that he had discussed about his hectic work schedule with me early on in our relationship and he expected me to be more understanding and allow him to meet his friends during his free time.
Am I really asking too much from him? I feel very lonely in the relationship and I'm thinking of leaving if this goes on.

57425,100810,"Recently, my department welcomed a fresh grad. When asked if this is his first job, he said no. He was actually from an e-commerce company but left the organisation. I didn't probe too much into the details of his leaving. But I would just like to say that it's ok for fresh grads to feel pressured and stressed when they first start to work. It's also ok to see them leave their first job within a matter of months. In fact, it's normal. I too, was a classic case of leaving my first job after several months due to some matters.
Why is it ok? Fresh grads tend to have this mindset of what their ideal job should be. They aim and strive to create that perfect picture in their first job. But reality isn't always the case and setbacks and disappointments ensue, which cause them to leave the work. It's actually good, because now they know that the line of work doesn't really suit them, be it people, responsibilities or company vision, mission. Since they are young, they are able to bear a bit of the loss and search for another job.
If they get another offer, good for them. If they don't, then it's time to search hard. And this is also a lesson for them. To cherish and realise that their ideal job is not as realistic as they thought it to be. Then in their next line of work, they would be able to put aside such thoughts and focus.
People who think that these fresh grads are strawberry or durian generation. No they are not. They are just normal human beings that are still trying their best to navigate the working world, one that is already being ruled by laojiaos who set the rules as and how they want them to be, and these young people have no choice but to get used to it.
So let's not judge them and instead, support them. Teach them the things they need to do their work. Don't know much excel skills (most grads I know really know a few basics only because in uni, who uses excel often? It's all R, Python, Solidworks, Matlab, Arduino), teach them what you use.
They don't talk during department lunches. That's fine. It's their way to assimilate and trying to be a part of the group. Initiate conversations with them, get them to talk about themselves. And please, after a few months, there's really no need for department lunches. Sometimes, even I want my own time to just rest my head on the table in silence instead of faking smiles at the kopitiam table. Let them do their own things during lunch. You never know, they might be watching a drama that you are watching too. More things to talk about.
To all young and fresh grads, know that you are not alone, this guy here typing, and many others out there were just like y'all. Learn and absorb. Blend in well without losing yourselves. And always be courteous and reasonable, and pass down this attitude to the next generation of new people. Because like you, they will need your support.

58054,102124,"I'm married and I've let another person got too close to me. I know I've cheated but at that time the word 'cheat' did not enter my mind.
We were colleagues and work on different floors. I noticed we take the same route to work. I would see her a few stops after me while on the way to work. She's very friendly and would say hi and make small talk. We bumped into each other so often till we decided to meet and go to work together. I didn't think much of it because she's just a friend to me. She started to send me good morning texts. I didn't think much of it. I start to respond back the same greetings.
I found out that we have a few similar interests so sometimes she would send me related jokes so we would have a good laugh. I start to reply back the same. I thought since she knows I'm married there shouldn't be a problem as I see her as a younger sister. I was having some family issues then, and her jokes cheered up my day when I'm down. When she flirts with me, I flirted back to show her I understood.
I notice she was texting me more often. I thought it was starting to feel weird, it felt like courtship? But I considered her a friend so I just continue to talk to her. She would ask me for help and guidance regarding work as well as her personal relationships. I feel bad for her because I get the sense she has a sad past and she seems to make childish decisions in regards to love. All this while I do not have sexual or romantic feelings for her. I do care for her as a friend. I also wonder why is she on my mind all the time. Sometimes she would take the jokes too far and mention my wife which I dislike. So I would ignore her.
This continued for months until she was blast texting my phone one day while I was home and my wife saw the messages.
I was still in denial mode when my wife confronted me about my relationship with this person. I defended myself and insisted I'm just friends with her. But I couldn't answer about the amount of talking and the amount of photos exchanged. I try to convince myself and also my wife it's just a normal friendship because I didn't touch that person.
What made an impact on me that I've really done wrong was the reaction of my wife. I didn't know I can hurt her so badly. My wife didn't eat and sleep for over two days. She barely drank anything. I've never seen her in such a deranged state. She would suddenly wail, scream, sob, hit me, tell me she hate me. Hug me. Tell me she love me. To know I am the cause of her pain, I feel great shame and guilt, almost unbearable. I love my wife and I have no idea how to make things better for her. To know that she will never trust me again, I don't know how to make it up to her that I will never do anything like this again.
I've since cut off all communications with this person and blocked her. She tried to get in touch with me but I don't care about her anymore. I also felt like I was being played by this woman. So there's no way I will rekindle this friendship.
To people who always say once a cheater always a cheater. I have to disagree. Not everyone is like this. I never want to be that person again. I would never want to hurt my wife again. Else I will lose her forever. I would rather not exist anymore should I ever lose her this way. She's everything to me. She's my forever person. I want to grow old with her. Only her. And I hope she forgives me one day.

57608,101248,"Tldr: I think I ruined my parents marriage and feel guilty.
I'm 30+ this year and was a bully back in primary school. No excuses. I was an asshole, idiot, dick... Back then, I made the unlucky mistake of picking on a rich boy, whom we shall refer to as Q. I didnt know Q is rich, which primary school kid knows the concept of rich/poor? Q accidentally fell and broke his arm.
The school called both sides' parents down for counseling. Q's dad is some high flyer in the private sector and did not have any intention of mediation. He came to inform my parents that he intends to file a civil lawsuit, claiming medical expenses and damages to the family, he also showed us copies of medical reports. My parents pleaded on the basis that
1. They were willing to pay for the medical bills (private hospital somemore)
2. If the verdict is in Q dad's favour, my parents wont have money to pay him anyway, they would be bankrupted and Q dad wont get the money either way.
3. My mum was an office admin and my dad was a taxi driver, they don't earn much.
Q's dad looked straight at me and said ""I'm not after the money, I have money. I'm trying to teach you a lesson."" It has been 20 years but I will never forget his look. He was out for my family's blood. My dad caned and screamed at me that night.
The lawsuit ruled in Q dad's favour. We had to pay for our own lawyers fees, his lawyers fees, the medical bills and Q's dads loss of income (he had to take off work few days to counsel Q). Thank god it didnt bankrupt us but it devastated my parents' finances.
They controlled me extremely tightly after in sec school, which contributed to the strained relationship between my parents and me. Their relationship also began to change. My mum began calling my dad ""useless"" or not being able to earn money or ""have connections"" or being ""only a taxi driver"". Parents divorced almost 10 years ago.
This guilt is eating me. Had I not been a dick, maybe money will be ok. Maybe my parents will still have their marriage. I am not the same person I was 20 years ago, but my family is still feeling the effects of that ""punishment"". Isnt the punishment disproportionate? my family is broken up over what some stupid primary school students did? How is this fair? just because the other side has money? Q is prolly over it and leading a good life. I cant help but think the rich really know how to turn every situation into their advantage and bully us normal people.

I have been hearing about the so called general norms of setting up a joint acc and contribute to the said account for the expenses etc based on your income. Each couple has different arrangements. Let me share mine..
My husband has been working in financial industry with senior positions, hence he brings more income for our household. Since our dating time,I have asked him what his preference is. Setting up a joint account and contributing x percentage according to our income? He proceeded to tell me that he will take care of all the bills and expenses. Let me keep my portion of salary (at this point of time, we never went for BTO as he already purchased his own property).
And yeah we proceeded to do that. He paid all the household bills,groceries,car n house installments, even my online shopping bills, meal with my friends, all those big expenses like hospital bills and insurance plans. He said that since he earns way more,let him take care of me as it is his duty as a guy and as a head of family. He said he is looking for a wife and future mother of his kids, not a business partner, so why need to calculate so much? He asked me to keep my salary and encouraged me to keep working in order to have a sense of financial freedom, building my self confidence and to enhance my personal growth as well as networking. As a husband, he's going to be my pillar of support and I can always rely on him emotionally and financially. He is also giving me a small amount of monthly allowance as a token of appreciation.
Now that we have a baby, I have quit my job since I cannot bear to be away from my baby, but I feel guilty for not working. Nevertheless, he told me that it does not matter, he will support my family's monthly allowance (I'm still giving monthly allowance to my fam btw) on top of providing me with extra allowance. Of course our savings will shrink, but he said why so calculative?His money is my money too. I have contributed a lot by being a mother to our baby, and he feels sorry for not being able to spend more time to take care of our baby due to his busy work schedule. He said I have worked hard and contribute so much in giving birth and sacrificing my careet in order to raise our baby, so he is doing the minimum he can do as a husband.
I know every couple has their own arrangement..nothing is wrong or right, it really depends on their own circumstances and level of comfort. I really appreciate my husband as I know he is rare in the market (even all my friends told me so). What works for me may not work for others and vice versa. In return, what I provided to my husband is respect and prudence. I let him have his financial freedom and discourage him from making big purchases like buying branded goods for me or fancy car or posh private property. I'd rather he channel his cash for investment and saving plans. I'd rather not burden our finance by insisting to purchase fancy house or car for ""face"", but to do it when we can very comfortably afford the loan installments.
That being said, every couple has different definition of being ""calculative"". I'm sharing mine as I would like to say that, husband will not lose anything by contributing more if they can afford to. Afterall,a wife will turn your house to home, carry your baby for 9 months, breastfeed and nurture your family, all while working as well. Can these being split 50-50 also? Down the road, there are roles which will continue to grow between husband and wife. I want my daughter to have a financial independence to build a family, but I also wish for her husband to treat her like what her daddy treats me. As such, I would also like my son to treat his future wife like how his father is treating his mother.
Selflessness will trigger sincerity and gratitude. A little goes a long way :)
P.s. for singles, do not give up on looking for a partner that wholeheartedly loves and respects you. I found mine on dating apps :) hehe, thank you for reading. Have a good day!

58140,102305,"Shopee is actually a Chinese company pretending to be from Singapore/Southeast Asia.
Culture wise, it is no surprise that employees have intense hours, often giving you demeaning useless work just because your manager can or upper management flip prata
Employees are expected to grind to prepare for big days (1/1, 2/2, 3/3, etc.) but the company just keeps coming up with more big days (3/15??) to keep the grind on.
Interview and pay wise, they also operate like a Chinese company. They asked for documents all the way back to secondary school, all my past pay slips, and even demanded for the detailed breakdown of current offer (which I have to give in order to continue interviewing, and no, quoting Jo Teo does not work)
I had to suck up, praise and say nice things to the HR, and, if not I was given bad interview time slots. I felt disgusted but I know it’s part of the culture.
To add insult to injury, after giving me take home assignments and multiple interview rounds, and knowing all details about my other offers, they low balled me and offered me just a low few % higher than my last drawn, even after adding share. My other offer was completely ignored. It was 50% higher than what Shopee was offering. Why even ask me about my offer breakdown and documents if you are just going to offer last drawn + 3%??
They offered more equity but it does not matter because the stock has dropped so much.
I was so surprised that CCS welcomed them so publicly last year. Is he out of touch or is he just chasing after the number of jobs SEA bring to Singapore?
I regret accepting this for the brand name. Will brand name pay off in the future? Or did I make the wrong choice?

After few months he wanted to try on his own so he invested 1000 USD, everything was lost and he invested 500 USD few times and all lost and he asked me to give 10K USD so that he can make profit, so I gave him and it was also lost.
After which he borrowed 36k SGD from the bank and invested, this time I was unaware that he'd borrowed money from the bank, somehow I found out by myself so I warned him to stop this but he believed he will make profit but due to market fluctuations his borrowed money was about to finish in forex so to save the loss he needs to top up.
We had our daughters saving saved for more than 10 years in her child account and that was linked to his account, he promised he won’t touch this account but he had no choice as he needs to save his money in forex he took 82K SGD from our savings and topped up his forex without my knowledge.
Within one month all the money in his forex is lost. And now we have zero in savings.
I am lost as I don’t know where to start now, please advise me how do I proceed further in my life. How to make my hubby stop this forex trading and concentrate on making money by doing some part time job apart from his job. I have two daughters who are still in primary school. My parents are also dependent on us. Please help me by providing some advice.

57436,100836,"[How much monthly allowance do you give your parents?]
I give my parents 20% of my salary (>$700) ever since I started working two years ago, and 20% of any bonuses when I get them too. I learnt that I give the highest percentage amongst my friends, but I’m okay with that as I can afford to and somehow this 20% proportion has been ingrained in my mind since young.
Recently, my partner and I secured a BTO. Somehow, this got me to start thinking about finances seriously. I feel that I should save more for future uses such as the wedding, honeymoon, house, renovation and any emergency spending. I’m not engaged yet, but just generally thinking about the future and making a mental note that I have to start being more financially savvy now that we have a home (yay!).
I innocently shared this with my mum but she got angry instead and started ranting that kids nowadays only care about planning for their own future and kicking their parents aside. I clarified that I have no intention to change or withdraw the 20% of my salary that I have been providing. I only wanted to save a higher proportion of the remaining amount after setting aside the monthly allowance. However, she insisted that I have become stingy ever since getting together with my partner and that I only cared about my own future.
Honestly, I feel quite angry at her accusations as I have not once given anything lesser than 20% of whatever I have. She also commented that I could rely on my partner and need not plan to save so much, which I do not agree with. We should aim towards being able to support ourselves regardless of whether we have someone to rely on, isn’t it? I really don’t know what’s wrong with children planning for their future as the point of planning ahead is to avoid having to take parents’ money for our own expenses next time. Furthermore, I am still giving the 20% without any intention to stop, and I don’t know why she’s so defensive every time I talk about my own financial planning. Sigh.
Just wanted to get this off my chest. Thank you for hearing me out.

This year, I met a girl that really sparked my interest. Unfortunately, she is married. However, she is very nice to me, I feel that she is treating me more than just a good friend.
Lately, I received a warning from her husband via a call, telling me to leave her for good. I didnt really felt comfortable with that message and thus decided to compete with him. ( I am not one who gives up easily)
The justifications are as follows:
1. They dont have a child yet
2. I am a blackbelt in karate and I fear no threats. The more one pushes me, the more I will resist.
3. She might be in an abusive relationship given her husband's tone, I need to save her from this toxic relationship.
4. I am not young anymore and good single girls are almost extinct. Mostly are attached to the tall and tanned guys ( who arent even as educated as I ???) I cant trust the millenial girls nor SPGs.
Any comments?

58213,102441,"A lot of men like to complain that their wives & gfs have low s** drives, that they’re “never in the mood for s**”.
Well guess what? Most women enjoy s**. We LIKE s**. But only when we are feeling comfortable, happy and in a good headspace.
The problem with men is that they’re only affectionate & sweet only when they’re trying to get laid. When a man starts touching or kissing me, he’s not doing it to be sweet & affectionate, we both know he’s trying to get into my pants.
I’m currently involved with someone, and I absolutely detest having s** with him. He’s overall a decent man, but he always makes it blatantly obvious that he EXPECTS s** whenever we spend time together. It’s the expectation that turns me off.
Some days when I was totally not in the mood, or I got my period etc; and I say no. He reacted very negatively to this- his reaction ranging from sulking & huffing & sighing loudly next to me, to throwing tantrums and banging doors, banging things around, vocally expressing all his frustrations.
But whenever he gets to have s**, he’s all sweet & nice again. Wow manipulative much?
Like seriously if u start behaving like an asshole the minute my legs aren’t open for you, that’s when your true colors come out, and I lose all respect for you.
I think I speak for most women when I say it’s a huge turn off when a man behaves like he’s entitled to my body. Like hello, I already grant you access to my body on a regular basis, and I have the right to say no to you occasionally when I’m not in the mood or not well. My body is not a all-you-can-eat buffet.
So now, I totally have lost all my s** drive. I am dead & numb from the waist down. Whenever he wants s**, I just give in because it’s easier than dealing with his f***ing toddler tantrums. I just lie there like a dead fish and wait for it to be over. To be honest sometimes I even feel like I’m being used; and I feel so damn resentful towards him.
I can’t wait to dump him and never have s** with a man again. He totally ruined my drive with his behavior. Absolutely appalling and disgusting. He’s made something that was supposed to be enjoyable into something that feels like a chore.
So guys. If your other half doesn’t seem to be in the mood, PLEASE don’t force it. The worst thing you can do is react badly to her saying no, by reacting aggressively or even passive aggressively. Don’t even try to be subtle with a sour attitude. We can sense it.
All we want to hear is, “It’s okay baby.. we don’t need to have s** today if you’re not feeling up to it. Let’s just chill okay?” It’s that simple.
S** is so much more enjoyable when the other party is not SO hung up about whether he’s getting laid; and he just wants to spend time with me. If a man were to just offer me a back rub or foot rub after a long day without expecting anything in return, I think there’s a high chance I’ll actually want to jump him.
A man who can fully respect boundaries and our bodily autonomy is rare; and that quality makes a man so attractive tbh.
A man who can be affectionate, and touch me in non-s**ual way, is so much hotter than a desperate man who’s like constantly trying to burrow his way into my pants every single time he’s near me. Ew.

58000,102011,"As we approach the job-application-spamming season, I thought as an interviewer I should just say this again: DON'T PAD YOUR RESUMES. I recently had an applicant who wrote ""Financial Regulator: Ensured the steady and uninterrupted flow of financial transactions from more than 50,000 clients over a 3-month period"". When I asked where, he said ""7-Eleven"". He was a cashier.
Bottom line: if you write about something in your resume, be prepared to be asked about it. Another interviewee I had last month was clearly taken aback when I asked about his volunteering experience at a childcare center, and fumbled his answer, making himself sound like a pedophile: ""As a kid, I spent a lot of time at childcare centers, and was touched by the kindness of the teachers there, so it inspired me to touch as many children as possible.""
Most companies don't care about volunteering stuff so it's best to leave those out if you are not prepared to talk about it. Lastly, to female applicants, unless you are applying to social escort companies, there is NO NEED to flaunt your cleavage/bare shoulders in your resume photo.

57910,101803,"Just a rant. My girlfriend is very insecure lately. We have been together for over 2 years and for the last 6 months we are having multiple arguments over our boundaries. Firstly, she found that I have been following 300+ bikini models on IG and we got into a fight over this. Her basis was that she felt disrespected that i had to follow and like on every bikini photo these models post to validate them. I mentioned that they’re just mindless likes and its not like I would date them or would even have a chance to see them as they’re overseas. She got angrier and said that if I had the chance I probably would jump at them then and I’m being insensitive towards her feelings.
She then brought up the issue of not posting photos of her on my IG and ig stories. I told her that I do not enjoy posting my private life on social media so as to reduce my digital footprint plus our friends and family all know about our relationship so this shouldn’t be an issue anyway. She had the guts to then bring up how i wanted to remain private but still openly showing likes to kpop idols and influencers posts on social media, calling me a hypocrite.
I personally feel that its two separate issues but now everything feels so messy. Recently she saw that I placed a photo of my fav female idol in my car and she actually got annoyed again because I didn’t have any photos of her/us in my room or car. I told her that I just wanted to look at my bias photo after a tiring work day. She’s now asking me to keep a printed copy of our photo in my wallet now but i really don’t feel like giving in to her demands anymore.
I don’t understand why she’s so insecure about our relationship and find the need to nitpick on my social media behaviours and photos I bring along with me. Isn’t it enough that I chose and waited many months for her to be my gf out of the other girls enough to show that I am dedicating myself to this relationship.

58869,103661,"Tl;dr: I'm considering turning gay because guys seem to want me more than my gf does.
I've been in a relationship with my gf for over three years now. Ngl after we got together, she stopped bothering about her image and appearance and look nothing like how she was in the past (gained weight, don't make makeup). My gf also pays me very little attention these days and our lives are becoming more monotonous and routine.
I wanted to feel validated by the opposite sex so I started using dating apps. I have no intentions to cheat, I just wanna know my market value as a dude and whether I'm still in demand. I wasn't the most popular dude on dating apps but not too shabby either (few matches per day).
But lo and behold! The girls I get suggested on the dating apps are all dino bus. Either they are old, fat and ugly or young, ugly and dumb. There's the occasional chio one but as expected I don't get a reply. The number of likes I get are crazy low compared to years ago when I was active on the app. This hugely damaged my confidence as a hot young male.
In a desperate attempt, I changed my gender preferences in the app to be male and started seeing male suggestions. Holy cow, I was getting over 10 likes a day from the dudes. It felt good. I liked a few of them back and started chatting. Some of them are super funny and flirty. I really enjoyed chatting with them. They made me feel super wanted and validated. This is the validation I have been craving for, though I didn't expect it to be coming from males.
Now I'm super confused. Am I bisexual because I'm enjoying attention from guys? Should I turn gay and break up with my gf so that I can be with these guys who want me so badly?

He paid for everything else for all the monthly household expenses, i never had to worry. But I neglected his mental needs. He wanted attention from me but knew I'm always attending to my needy toddler. Being athletic, he loves running he love outdoor activities. He was a doting husband no doubt. But he found himself getting more lonely. We have been talking since a few nights ago, tonight he finally opened up. He's not the type who speaks up when unhappy but I told him calmly I wanna listen to his thoughts, not what he wants to do to redeem his deeds. After 2 nights of confrontation, tonight I told him I can forgive but I'll never forget. I'll slowly pluck out that thorn and hope it will be filled with his acts eventually. I'm not perfect either, to save this marriage, I have to take that step back. We promised to work out the differences together.
Msg to all wives: I hope you'll never encounter something like this. I never thought I would either. I hope this major test will make our love and marriage even stronger, and make sure the husband's needs don't get neglected even after having children. He comes into your life first after all.
