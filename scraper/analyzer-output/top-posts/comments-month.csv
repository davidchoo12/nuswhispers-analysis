61077,108171,"Dear Prof Ben, please help me out.
I just got married not long ago and moved in with my husband. However after moving in together I found that my husband is an extremely disrespectful person. 
We work from home in the same study room and as someone who loves to chat, during the day I often initiate conversations with my husband but he's never paying attention to me. He's always deep in his work and even when I'm talking he is still looking at his computer and typing away. I have raised this issue multiple times to him and he says his work requires a lot of concentration and he can't respond to me immediately every time I talk to him. He says we can allocate time during the day to talk, like during lunch or tea breaks, but not when he's working. However, I'm someone who needs to get something off my chest right away so what he proposed is unacceptable to me.
I find such behavior so rude and am contemplating a divorce. We don't have a kid yet and the stakes are low now. Other than this ignoring behavior, he's actually a responsible husband. Should I go ahead with it?

When he knows im getting my salary he will immediately call me and ask me to trf half of the salary. Claiming he has no money and need money for his food, ciggs. Almost everyday i trf him half of my salary and the next day he will come and ask me more money for him. Even if i say i don't have enough he will keep insisting on it and keep irritating me and disturbing me to borrow money from others to give him. He owes me till date arnd $28K. But he say that i have failed as a gf and i throw him in the fire. Just cause my cousins told me to stop giving him money as he should earn for himself and not be taking it from me.

61099,108187,"Recently I met a guy on a dating app and he suggested to meet up which I agreed. We went to a cafe and ordered a coffee each. Afterwards, he suggested a walk in a shopping mall so I thought he was interested to know me more after the coffee date. It got closer to dinner time and he suggested to eat at a food court which was super crowded and definitely not a good place to talk. Both of us come from decently wealthy families and work in very well-paid industries. I was not expecting a high-class restaurant or something, but maybe not a food court? Maybe some ramen restaurants or reasonably priced western food restaurants like Astons? So I am confused, is he interested in me? If yes, why did he suggest food court when I had introduced many other food options inside that shopping mall? If not, why did he suggest the walk and the dinner subsequently?

61084,108150,"How much do you guys typically spend on a weekend trip to Japan? Total expenses. I see a lot of young couples my age traveling and I can never convince myself to part with spending more than $1000 over a weekend even though I make six-figures in tech. 
Perhaps also an out-of-line question, do you guys not worry about your retirement? Like since I was in my first year of uni I had dreams of retiring at the age of 40-45. I’m saving every cent that I don’t absolutely have to spend and still it seems like I’m not saving enough. But then I see my peers going to Japan one weekend, Korea another, and then Europe. I am 28 and I just hit 6 figures last year. Am I behind in income for my age? How much of your disposable do you typically end up saving per year? I save around 50% of my after tax income last year. My parents saved a much higher percentage when they were still working. Do people just not save? 
Follow up question: I am saving up for my first rental property. Is this a goal of every young person or are there far better stores of wealth that I’m not aware of?

61119,108228,"Hi, I would like some advice on what I should do - leave or stay?
To give some context, I’m currently dating a guy for about 5 months. However, he is unsure if he wants to continue and be official as he felt that a part of him still love his ex and he still thinks of her everyday.
There are a few things that I’m concerned about that makes me feel like I should leave 
- How we first started: he didn’t tell me that he has a gf then and we went out quite a few times (I later found out that he didn’t let his gf know too) - feels like he might cheat?
- How we first had s**: I told him I was not ready to do it and he said we will just kiss but he still ended up doing it and told me it doesn’t feel good that I resist 
- How we first decide to date: he was pestering me to go on a date with him and even tried to do this in office that makes me uncomfortable
- How he make me feel: I feel that he makes me feel sad almost everyday - I think the number of times I feel sad this year prob exceed the number of times I feel sad my entire life
Some reasons why I still stay:
- he provides some form of financial support (pays for most of my stuff)
- He told me that it would be weird if I date other ppl and they found out that I have done it before even though I never had a bf - so it is better for me to stay with him 
- We booked a trip for Jan 24 (it’s a secret from the whole world anyway)
- Whenever I decide to leave, it feels that there are always unexpected things to make me stay  (eg I got pregnant but we did the abortion alr)
- He tries to be nicer at least he is nicer than before
I have been seeing a counsellor after that incident and honestly, I know there are much better people out there but I’m not too sure why I find it so hard to leave.
Perhaps, it is due to the pregnancy that I was in my own world, the only person I talked to was him as I didn’t wanted to share this with anybody in my life.
I was thinking if we were ever to get together or married, I won’t want to introduce him to any of my family and friends because I’m not proud of him at all. So I know that there will be no future of any sorts even if he choose to stay.
So what should I do? I feel that leaving is the best choice but staying status quo for a while more is also fine. How do I make sure I do leave and get over it if I choose to leave?

61114,108220,"I have been in a relationship with a crazy girl for the past 6 years. We both met when studying at NUS. We started out as FWB before she proposed to be my gf. I recently chanced upon her boasting in secret chats that I was the best she ever had and sharing how she felt that I was out of her league. To date, the best thing in our relationship is still the sex, and that is pretty much the only thing keeping the relationship going. 
Sometimes I feel like a garbage collector because of the crazy things she does and the problems I have to deal with when she goes crazy. Just yesterday she called the police on me because I refused to have sex with her the previous night. And if you ever see a girl crying, screaming and shouting in public, that's probably her... This happens 99% of the time when I do not have sex with her the previous night or the very morning. So Im forced to spend hours every day having sex with her. Has anyone dated a girl like this or is also stuck in the same predicament?!

61118,108225,"I need to confess...
I met my wife 5 years back ago, when we were about to graduate. The first time I saw her, I told to myself ""She's the girl I want to marry. She's the girl I want by my side. She's the girl I want to protect."" But she was taken at that time.
A part of me felt so lost and wanted her so badly. A part of me felt I shouldn't disturb her and I should move on. I couldn't. So I stalked all her social media, be friends with her friends and got introduced as a ""mutual friend"". When we officially met for the first time, things were already not looking good between she and her boyfriend at the time. I took my chance to fill his spot and constantly gave her my support, my love. And eventually, she fell in love with as well. She decided to break it off with her then-boyfriend, although she didn't know I knew everything about her prior beforehand thus I was able to be the perfect listener for her. 
As we got together and with marriage coming into my mind but she was still not ready, I did a bold decision. I babytrapped her on purpose as I thought, ""with our kid, she will be with me forever. She will never leave me and she HAS TO marry me"". In the end she was furious when she got pregnant, but quickly let go of the issue as she thought we are both responsible. 
Flashback to now looking at our 3 years old daughter and her, she's still the same girl I want to take care for the rest of my life. Although we are financially stable and have a happy family right now while even waiting for our BTO, I feel so extremely guilty. I felt she will hate me, if she knew what really happened. I know I will probably take this secret to my grave, although I will have to carry this guilt for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry, but I love you too much. I know I was selfish, but I will spend the rest of my life making up to you.

61079,108168,"I've went on a few dates with this guy, and he's genuinely a sweet and considerate person. However, I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed by the number of gifts he gives me. Please don't get me wrong, I truly appreciate his generosity, but I'm not accustomed to receiving gifts from people outside my family. I'd prefer to see the money put towards a good cause or an experience we could share.
When we go out, he consistently chooses high-end restaurants where the bills can easily reach a couple of hundred bucks. I'm not someone with extravagant tastes in food, and I'd be just as happy dining at a more budget-friendly place. The constant extravagance feels unnecessary to me. Additionally, he frequently travels for work and brings back souvenirs from every country he visits. It's evident that he's a generous person who expresses his affection through gift-giving, but I lean more toward practicality. I've already got a bunch of expensive stuff I received from my fam that's just collecting dust in my closet, and some leather goods are starting to show their age because I hardly use them.
While I'm completely comfortable receiving gifts from my fam, I tend to feel pressured or like I owe someone a favor when it comes from anyone else. I genuinely appreciate his thoughtful act but I am not exactly comfortable with it. How can I navigate this situation tactfully?

I have a crush on one of the managers, let’s name him A. I really like A and we can hit it off pretty well and we would sometimes hang out for supper. I know he is married with 2 kids but I do not know all the nitty gritty details of his family status (revealed later). One day, my mum caught us hanging out and scanned through my phone and the next day, she took the matter in her own hands and made him quit. She twisted the story and called for an agency meeting to announce to everyone in the workplace that he was a scumbag, and cheated on his wife which all these was confided in her when he wanted to win the wife back. Was this necessary to air his dirty laundry in public? Or to name shame him and did not spare a thought for his wife whom wanted to keep it low profile? But if he was going through a divorce, wouldn’t that make him single right? It means I have a chance right? But why did she have to condemn him like that infront of everybody else and eliminate him, even forced him to resign just so that I could not get close to him? Because he’s married with 2 kids? My mum is so mean to expose this to everyone and defame him. Whatever her speech was in the meeting room to 80 over agents, was a twist of the story and made him swallow the blame for it 100%. I feel so useless I can’t even help him, but I have to play victim too because I am afraid of my mum. That was why I hurriedly used his phone to delete all the messages, leaving him no evidence to back himself up so that my mother will believe me that he “tried” on me but in fact, I was the first who made the first move to text him lovey dovey messages. I made him lose his career and now I’m being bounded by this authoritative figure at work and at home. I have no eye candy at work anymore, no friends to talk to and it is all my fault because it was me who started giving wrong signals first to him. I will have bad karma and my mum is no.1 best at making up stories and linking them up. I have already started people name-calling me like “like mother like daughter”. What should I do?

Through the conversation we had, I felt that we really clicked and she is a really well-mannered and filial girl. She said she yearns for company but is afraid of starting a relationship due to past experiences. Over time, I think I fell in love with her and I really want to protect her and make her happy.
I decided to pluck up my courage and told her that I hope we can go beyond fwb and do more things together as a couple… She immediately changed the topic, I thought perhaps she is shy and needs time to think through so I didn’t probe further.

Personally, I have interacted more with Girl A. I am also inclined towards Girl A as well, mainly because I shared more time with her. However, I am getting the impression that she may not be as romantically interested in me as Girl B. On the other hand, Girl B and I share more common topics, but her age may be a problem (age is subjective). Girl B also shares a similar level of emotional maturity as me, but Girl A falls close as well.
Not that I will decide on what to do based on the replies, but I am curious to know what this society thinks about the issue. All feedbacks are welcomed!

61142,108265,"My ex-boyfriend broke up with me after 4 years of our relationship. The reason is our relationship is no longer 'exciting'. We talked about getting married, building a family together, and even meeting each other's families. Everything seemed to be set and going well until suddenly one day we argued that he has changed over the years and so have I. As working adults, we don't have much time for each other except after work or the weekends. At some point, the frequency of meetings has reduced although we still call each other every day. The effort was diminishing and so was our love. Shortly after our breakup, he became aggressive about meeting new girls, chatted with them, and met up with a new one every week. 2 months after we broke up, he met this girl and posted an official couple photo on his Instagram and Facebook a month later to announce that he is now a taken man. I heard from my friends that he said the new girl isn't good-looking in a sort of tentative manner. Which I feel is not something nice and should be said about someone you are planning to date. My heart is torn into a million pieces and I can barely move on from such a heartless man. Some advice would be appreciated and maybe I am not seeing my ex for the person he is. Possibly, as an outsider a more objective POV could be provided on his character and whether or not it is time for me to truly let go of him..

61115,108221,"I’ve opened a Pandora’s box…
Just want to vent this out here and hear your thoughts.
I met this guy through dating app. We clicked and he got me pregnant after years of being in an r/s. We also got married. 
Currently I am still in my maternity leave. I am staying at home most of the time and taking care of the baby. One night, I was just feeling nostalgic how we started from dating app to this and I decided to backread our first conversation in his WS. I used his because I accidentally uninstalled my WS app earlier this year and I failed to have a backup of our conversation thread. I typed “hotel” in the search thread cos as consenting adults, we went to hotel when we were just starting and I wanna read how we progress from there, getting into relationship and marrying each other. 
But as I was scrolling to the year when we first met, I saw some conversation with “hotels” too and how they had sex, etc. I was flabbergasted and I don’t know how to react. 
In summary, this is the timeline. We first met on *insert date*. One week later, he had sex with this other woman he met in the app. One week later, we met again and kissed. Four days later, he had sex again with that woman. Two days later, he met with me in the hotel but we didn’t have sex that time though we made out. It was only two weeks later after we decided to be exclusive to each other but not officially tgt yet.
I didn’t know any of his sexual escapades until now. Not that his body count matters to me cos to be fair, we weren’t in a relationship that time so technically he was still single. But what bothers me is that what if we were having sex that time when he was hooking up with that woman? I think I couldn’t take it… 
Moving forward, I lowkey asked him if he had any ons/ fubu/fwb before meeting me and he said no. I was just appalled how he could lie to me, or maybe he just really doesn’t want me to know that part of his past.. 
I felt that I have opened a Pandora’s box and tbh I still love him the same. He has been a wonderful husband and father. I am aware that those are things from the past and what matters is the present and the future. Though, I felt relieved that I didn’t have sex with him that time that he was shagging other woman. Also, he also has been faithful to me eversince we decided to become exclusive until we officially dating. I am just feeling betrayed on how he lied to me. Because I would appreciate his honesty— that’ll only imply that he trusts me with his deepest and darkest secrets, but unfortunately he didn’t…

We talked about it and he told me he's taking steps to stop the porn habit and assured me it was the only challenge, with the other two concerns under control. I trust him and see a future with him, but I'm worried that his lack of self control may turn around to bite me in the future, such that whenever he goes out alone I can't help but worry that he may visit a parlour or cheat on me.

We dated for over 18 month before I gave myself to him. I did everything that he wanted because I love him so much. I wanted him as much as he wanted me then. He was my first everything. I thought he was the one. He was so patient, loving and kind to me. Now I wonder were there others when we were seeing each other. Was anything real between us? How did I not see this coming?
How can I be on top of the world with him then and feel like I'm in hell now? I feel so worthless now. I yearn for him and I hate him. Why did he do this to me...... was our love ever real? Now I see that he changed his profile pic to him and that girl. My heart has gone numb. I never mattered to him? He got over me so quickly? My friends told me to ignore him as he's not worth it. How can I? How did the love vanish overnight? How do I move on? The pain is unbearable.

61080,108143,"PSA: To the girl who sat beside me on the Downtown line MRT and traveled all the way to Bukit Panjang MRT station today (Monday, 23 Oct 2023), at around 10pm, I felt a strong attraction towards you and really regret not asking for your number.
You were wearing black long-sleeved-top/cardigan, and blue jeans, with black shoes. You were on your phone most of the time throughout the ride. During the ride, I considered back and forth about asking for your number, I wondered what if I get shouted at for approaching a girl in public, especially in Singapore's conservative society. And it's not like I have a lot of experience approaching girls in public too.
When we alighted, I was tired from the workday, but something about you gave me a rejuvenating essence and aura when I saw you walking in front of me. I contemplated stopping you to ask for your number as we went up the escalator, but upon reaching the end of the escalator, you soon went a different direction opposed to where I intended to go, and I chickened out.
I came across you again outside the bus interchange at the escalator minutes later, but I was too much of a pussy and didn't stop you and took a chance to ask. Sigh, should had grown some balls...
If this is you and you came across this post, please comment below the outfit I was wearing (what top, what bottom (what colour was my top and bottom for better accuracy so I know it's you)), and bonus if you can say what I was holding too so I know it's you fo sure. Would be nice to take you out on a date! I'm taking a chance here guys, this could be fate.
Do your fellow Singaporean son here a favour and help share this post guys!
And to the guys out there, learn from my mistakes, next time if you see a girl you like outside, muster up some courage and just try to chat her up a bit and then get her number. I dilly-dallied so much and missed an opportunity.

61087,108159,"Hi, could anyone please confirm if my approach is correct? Additionally, I would appreciate your feedback or advice.
I am a 35-year-old foreigner who had been unemployed for seven months since April, including the period after my last job interview, which eventually led to my current position. I dedicated numerous hours every day to job applications. The time spent editing my resume and writing cover letters was incredibly extensive. I even recorded my applications in an Excel sheet, totalling just over 200. Despite holding a PhD in life sciences from a local university and having 3 years of work experience, I found it deeply disheartening not to receive a single job offer in about six months. Out of these 200+ applications, I only had five job interviews, all of which I believe I performed extremely well in. The challenges arose due to factors such as retrenchment, the closure of biotech start-ups, switch in government's plan for the nation, and funding cuts across research institutes. Moreover, there have been restrictions on hiring foreigners over the past 6-7 months, as observed from my foreign friends who also struggled to find jobs in Singapore. Regardless of my skills, background, knowledge, and experience aligning with job descriptions, I suspect my applications were often disregarded based on nationality.
After three months of job hunting, I broadened my options to include opportunities slightly outside my expertise, including non-research roles. About three months later, I progressed through two rounds of interviews for a position I'm not particularly interested in. I decided to accept it to sustain myself financially, planning to explore better opportunities in research later on. I couldn't afford to stay unemployed any longer, so I opted for this job that could provide income, even if it wasn't my ideal choice.
Here's where the discouragement sets in. Some of my friends, including locals, criticized me for taking a job meant for more qualified candidates. They argued that these candidates might be more passionate and productive, thus it would be better for the company to hire them instead. Others questioned why I would settle for a job unsuited to my interests, implying that it would lead me back to square one if I quit after a few months. They also questioned the value of learning new skills if I wouldn't use them in the long run when I returned to research.
I understand that highly qualified jobs are valuable and might be better suited for candidates with more relevant skills. However, am I wrong for taking a job out of necessity? I underwent tertiary education, spent months applying for jobs, put extensive effort into interview preparations, and went through the formal hiring process like any other candidate. Why am I wrong for securing a job that isn't my primary interest? Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

61081,108144,"Am I gaslighted or overthinking?
I’m one month postpartum and I believe that I wasn’t the same person I was before. Please help me and give me advice. 
For context, my husband has an ex, which was a dear friend to him prior their relationship. During our dating stage, he was open to tell me that he wanted to reconnect with her cos he still sees her as a friend. But this ex has blocked him from her socials and no communication since their breakup. They have common friends so he was informed that she was getting married (this happened 2021) But he doesn’t have any updates with her since then. We got married recently and also I have given birth also. 
Now, one day, I woke up in the middle of the night, and he was in the toilet. He left his computer on, out of curiosity I checked his recently closed tabs until I saw that he was looking at his ex’s FB profile (using dummy account). I know it’s wrong cos I invaded his privacy but I was just curious what he’s doing on his computer while I sleep. I confronted him about it and he told me that he felt that I violated his privacy. He even said that I had nothing to worry about and he had been open how he wanted to reconnect with her. Moreover, he said that it’s scary that I snooped on his computer like that and he didn’t once do it to me cos he respects my privacy and he trusts me. When I asked him why he was stalking his ex, he said that it wasn’t stalking but more like he wanted to see how she was doing. The argument led me apologizing to him for invading his privacy. He even said that he sees nothing wrong with what he did. 
I wasn’t like this before I give birth but now I’m too sensitive about everything. Are my feelings even valid or was it really my wrong for checking his recently closed tabs out of curiosity?

First of all to those people who keep talking about pretty privileges, I DO NOT DENY IT EXISTS. But we have it tough as well. I'm 24M, already some years over my NS days. But my skin is those where it never gets tan at all. So even until now, my skin is clean and white AF. Not only that, I do know that I look better than average although I don't think I look good looking enough to be considered ""Handsome"".
Speaking chinese often, people around me tend to call me “清秀” and ""俊美” which I am not sure whether it is to be a compliment. They often mistake me as a Taiwanese/Korean. But I am starting to feel my looks are a hinderance to my relationship life. For f*ck sake, I got rejected by girls which only to be told by their friends that ""she thinks you're a player, but your looks rlly honestly give the f*ckboi vibes"".
什么 the f*ck? I can control how I look meh? I tried tanning my skin and it doesn't work at all. I cannot grow a beard, nor a mustache fits my face shape. I'm done bro, when guys ugly people call us ""simp, desperate”. When guys look better, people call us ""f*ckboi, player"". What is it u girls want??? WALAO.

61141,108263,"Need relationship advice???? 
We have been in a relationship for almost 4years. 
So my bf has a girl bestie he knew frm gaming, he already quited gaming since 2022. Thy don’t usually contact until she broke up with her bf in 2022. The girl doesn’t really have much friend and kinda negative/emo. So since she move out from her bf hse, she rented a hse nearby my bf house because it is near to public transport. She dont drive. 
So whenever she need to rant or smoke buddy, she will ask my bf to go over her hse. Initially, I was like ok, she just broke up, u can go and console or be her listener. Bt then now already year end of 2023, she will still ask my bf to go for smoke/chat/ranting. I started to feel uncomfortable and voice out like why are you always available to girl whenever thy need ranting? I understand if thy don’t really communicate alot, something happened, and she need someone to talk to, but not like every month or every few month right? I really dont understand why sometimes the girls keep asking someone’s bf for ranting or like hangout eventho she know he have a gf. 
So my bf reasoning was she doesn’t have much frn. In my mind i was thinking, he asked me to stop chatting with one of my guy colleague or even eat with him. His reasoning was he feel uncomfortable of that guy. So now i feel uncomfortable bcz of this, bt he keep saying that they are just brother/friend. He have to be there for her to rant.  I don’t smoke, so usually he will smoke far away from me or whenever he is in the office with his colleague. 
Anyway, idk what I’m saying anymore. Am i too insecure or my feelings is valid? Girls out thr, pls let me know ????

61097,108184,"I had been in a relationship for five years, and it was the first serious one for both of us, which made it special in the beginning. I'm more of an indoor person, so my favorite dates involved spending time at his place, where we'd each do our own activities. He'd play games or watch funny videos while I enjoyed my shows or read novels. Occasionally, we'd have light-hearted conversations, sharing funny thoughts and laughing together before returning to our own interests. I felt very comfortable with how things were, and I believed he was the one for me.
We did have some differences – I tended to be more demanding, but he was incredibly accommodating. I grew up in a family that struggled to express affection, while he was more carefree and needed verbal expressions of love and emotional support due to his sensitivity. I didn't consider these differences a problem because he was so understanding, and I made an effort to communicate my feelings with love, even if there were times I was too harsh, which I later reflected and tried to change. 
We got a BTO (Built-to-Order) flat last year and were eagerly waiting for it. However, I wanted us to move out this year because we were both sharing our living spaces with our siblings. So, we decided to apply for an HDB rental for couples waiting for their flats. This change disrupted our plans, including our wedding timeline.
We had already scheduled photoshoots and set dates for ceremonies, and everything seemed to be going well. However, just one week before the wedding photoshoot, he expressed his concerns. He worried about the uncertainties in our future, whether we could bridge our differences, and the possibility of a future divorce, which was particularly alarming because his parents had gone through a painful divorce, leaving a lasting impact on him. I tried to reassure him that differences were normal in any relationship and that love could help us overcome them, but he remained anxious.
I suggested that we identify the instances where he felt uncomfortable with our future plans, and I promised to be reasonable and open to discussion. He began listing various concerns, including not liking the color of my wedding dress, which we had chosen two months earlier, and this triggered my frustration. I felt that if he had reservations, he should have voiced them earlier. He claimed that he didn't fully understand my perspective and only agreed due to my insistence, which left me puzzled.
I cherished his sweetness and willingness to accommodate my wishes. I believed we shared similar thoughts and could overcome any challenges together. However, his recent change in attitude was unsettling. I was willing to compromise further to address his concerns, but I couldn't understand why he was suddenly blaming me for issues we had previously resolved. 
This situation led to a heated argument, and I canceled the photoshoot, telling him that we wouldn't proceed with the wedding until he sorted out his feelings. I felt angry and hurt, as I hadn't pressured him into proposing, buying a BTO flat, or planning the wedding. It seemed like he was allowing his fears to take control and not considering the impact of his actions on me. I felt lost and regretted investing five years in a relationship with someone who seemed unwilling to mature and face our challenges. When it came to booking an appointment for our ROM, I thought it was reasonable to have him take care of it. He initially agreed and, within about 10 minutes, told me he had completed the task. Naturally, I asked him to share a screenshot or proof of the successful submission so that we both had a record, ready to be shown if needed on the day. However, two minutes later, he returned, explaining that the appointment was in ""draft"" status, indicating he hadn't submitted it.
This was the first time he had failed to submit something, but there had been other instances where he made similar mistakes, though of varying significance. Given our previous conversations about how he didn't appreciate my blunt criticism and didn't like being scolded, I chose not to react harshly. I simply said, ""Okay, could you please submit it now?"" in a gentle manner, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed.
I couldn't understand why he couldn't complete tasks accurately. I believed that if he were genuinely excited about marrying me, he would have double-checked and triple-checked everything to ensure its correctness. The thought of us, along with our parents, standing at the entrance of the ROM only to realize that we couldn't proceed due to a mistake was a worrisome scenario. It seemed like he struggled to grasp the consequences of his mistakes and continued to make similar errors.
This situation made me feel like I was in the role of a nagging mother, constantly reminding her child to complete their homework, and then checking it repeatedly. I was looking for a partner who could take responsibility and handle tasks like an adult, not someone who repeatedly made avoidable errors.
During our time together, I often found myself in a motherly role, pushing him to complete tasks with minimal effort, like learning to drive or booking an appointment for our ROM (Registry of Marriages). I felt disappointed when he didn't follow through or made avoidable mistakes. Despite our talks about improving, he continued to make the same errors, making me feel like I was constantly checking up on him.
What bothered me the most was his decision to back out just one week before the photoshoot. I expected him to take responsibility for his choices as an adult and not put me in such a difficult situation, with our wedding plans already publicly announced. It was an emotional ordeal, and I couldn't forgive him for running away at a crucial moment, which felt like abandonment.
I suggested that he should seek professional help to address his anxiety and uncertainty about the future, and we should take a step back until he could secure a doctor's appointment. Unfortunately, this plan unraveled on the very first day of our cooling-off period. I found myself shedding tears at random moments, constantly haunted by what had transpired.
On the second day, he engaged in some introspection and declared that he would step up and be more responsible for our relationship. I couldn't help but wonder if I could trust this commitment, given my deep disappointment and past letdowns. I realized that I should have recognized his issues earlier and not placed myself in this emotional turmoil. If we hadn't already announced our marriage and secured a flat, I might have considered ending the relationship immediately. Perhaps I was also being somewhat hesitant in my own way.
I'm now at a loss about what to do. While I've given him a chance, I still find myself awake in the late hours, contemplating how much time I have left in my youth and what would happen if I made the wrong choice. I can't shake the feeling of fear that he might run away again, especially before the ROM or even after we have a baby.
What should i do?

61090,108165,"I just ended a 2006 days relationship with someone I was planning to propose to. It hurts but I know the correct advice is to move on.
I still remember the day I first saw her, our first date, the first time we held hands. The bits and pieces of us we leave behind in our rooms or belongings. All these memories are now reduced to objects.
How does one move on from this when one gets blindsided by it? When they are told it would be better and healthier for them to move on. When they know their partner is already contemplating on pursuing something with someone else.
Is it my fault that I took too long before proposing? Or that I thought we could go through anything as long as we stand by each other?
My friends tell me to not lose confidence in myself and that she just decided she wanted something else. Sound advice though a tough pill to swallow.
I believe nothing would change her mind anymore but I hope this reaches her since she might come across this.
I would like to wish you the best in life and thank you for all these years. I’ve loved you deeply and might always have a little place in my soul reserved for you. Be happy with whoever you end up with.

61098,108186,"My friends from ECE shared with me a video of an interview put out by their dept of their MSc student who apparently came from CS.
I found the entire video highly irregular and wrong in so many ways.
Why would any sane CS grad switch to engineering to do embedded systems? Previous confessions from seniors have confirmed the embedded industry is in decline. I can only conclude his skills are too poor to be an SWE thus he had to switch to hardware. A quick check online confirmed my suspicions that he was in CS when it was still a dumping ground. It's pathetic that the ECE dept has found this worthy.
Based on conversations with my ECE friends, I learn many engine grads don't end up practicing engineering, most aspire towards software or finance instead. Top ECE grads enter FAANG companies. Reality is entirely opposite from being portrayed.
I would argue against the point that finding software information is easy. If it is easy to self study online, why is CS so popular and even Profs like Prof Ben are complaining about his workload? If this is true, everybody can self study online to be an SWE instead of spending 4 years and paying so much for a CS degree. MSc and grad certs in CS, data science and AI are hugely popular post grad courses, surely more popular than masters in engineering which is supposedly harder to find information.
I don't get how working with obsolete machines is anymore useful to learning how modern computers work than actually working on modern machines. Can vintage machines do multi-threaded parallel processing? Can it do ML inferencing? Everyone is looking to the future yet this guy is stuck in the past.

So, let's dive into the wild world of hookup culture, which seems to be all the rage these days. I've been in the education biz for a good five years, and lately, I've been overhearing some young bucks talking about their 'body count.' One time, I strolled past a group, and this gal in her early 20s was proudly declaring that her body count (approx 10?) was higher than the number of people she's actually dated. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be all judgmental, but it got me thinking - is that something to be proud of? 
Yeah, I'm no spring chicken, but if I ever have a daughter, you better believe I'll be drilling some good ol' values into her. But here's the real question: Why do folks feel the need to flaunt their body counts? Is it a self-esteem thing, like they want to appear 'more wanted?

My female 'bro' friend once shared with the group that she had s3x with an ang moh after clubbing. Apparently, this had always been one of the things she wanted to on accomplish her 'to do' list. So I asked her how was the experience and she said it was the best, supposedly because he was the biggest she ever had. And then I asked her how big is he, and she said he was really very big. So I asked her exactly how big because we were all curious. She said she was also not sure because she didn't measure. So we took out a ruler and asked her to give an estimate. Then she used her hands to estimate 11-12cm... And she was so serious about 11-12cm being really very big. I was speechless I swear. For info, she is quite open about being sexually active and had about 10+ different sexual partners previously. I found it so confusing yet so funny because I thought 11-12cm was normal? Worst, the girls in the group got so excited and even agreed with her!! One of them even has a bf with only 7cm and she is very satisfied. Ok but to be fair they are all quite petite about 160cm and I am 183cm for reference, so not judging anyone for anything. 
We are all happily attached now and I really cherished all our healthy and honest convos about relationships and s3x during our university days. I appreciated how we approached such taboo topics as mature young adults. It really helped me grow a lot as a person and as a man to have such cool and solid friends. And I just want to say thank you to all of them.

61100,108189,"Regarding #108150:
There is nothing wrong with wanting to be rich. My father passed away when I was in secondary school because of a rare but curable cancer, and if we had $250,000 when he was diagnosed, he probably would not have died. He worked in construction and my mom worked at a nail salon. I have 3 siblings and we all lived in a one-bedder. I know a lot of people will disagree with me vehemently, but poverty is no fun.
I am now one year out of medical school and my goal is to give my family a better life. 
Believe me when I say I understand fully that money will be less than useless in death. To me, making money has never been about what I can spend it on. Money will enable me to be a safety net for my loved ones.
Buying unnecessary things, traveling, paying over the top for a meal, I have never quite understood the appeal of such things. Not that I ever could afford them in the first place. 
My best friend with whom I went to Hwa Chong grew up not too far from where Goh Chok Tong lives in Bukit Timah. He never spends more than $5 on a meal. It puzzled me in the beginning but then he revealed to me that he’s not being intentionally frugal he just found it difficult to justify how a $20 plate of chicken rice is 4x better than one he can get for $5. Today he is a Ivy League graduate who is in line to take over his father’s business, but he is still the same guy who wears washed out t shirts, takes the bus, and eats $3 cai fan whenever we do meet. 
When I was in medical school, I met friends from upper-middle class families who were as frugal as I am. It was only surprising how common they are, people whose parents are specialists, lawyers, businessmen who are more humble than a blade of grass. 
I’m not saying it’s wrong to live your life to the fullest. How anyone wants to live their life should be their prerogative. But I think if you want to mitigate the regret you will feel if you died prematurely by ignoring the fact that the vast majority of us will probably live as long as the life expectancy seems to suggest (84 years), then I think it would be a mistake not to make preparations for those ages that you will no longer be productive. 
Lastly I just want to say this, seeing the world can be a great experience, but the same critique that you can’t bring money to the grave can also be said about your memories. You bring nothing away because you simply cease to exist. People who obsess over money aren’t all shallow and materialistic. Some of us need it to pay for a better life for the people we care about.

I am a Year 4 NUS Architecture student, and as I am nearing the end of my studies, I really really cannot fathom, how is it that NUS architecture as an organization has survived for so many decades, without teaching anything and being so useless education wise. Let me say this, you don't learn anything in the 4 years and I am struggling to actually understand what its all worth as I am nearing the end.
It really reminds me of an Emperor with no Clothes. Moreover, I cannot believe its only last year in 2022, that the larger Public, knew about how bad things are in NUS architecture. I just wish I knew better and had some foresight, before enrolling...

when a younger newer girl comes, your true devotion will vanish into thin air  
hence, true devotion has no value. we need something tangible
even in the unfortunate event of divorce we can get half of the matrional assets
TLDR: you have to be realistic. if you are average, settle for a even slighty more average girl. someone who is willing to bto a 3 room hdb with you. but even then 10 years down the road, the girl will start to complain and compare you to her friends' husband, like you complain your employer isnt paying you enough

61127,108237,"Don't you love it whenever the topic of NS is brought up, there're many people who'll say, ""yeah it's the duty of a Singaporean son"", ""you gotta give back 2 years for the prosperity of your country"", etc.
Prosperity is not just defined by the GDP or GDP per capita of a country, it's how happy the average citizens are, not just the wealthiest or the most well-connected citizens. When we talk about Singapore getting more prosperous, are we talking about our average salaries going up? Our standards of living improving? Our society getting more harmonious and trusting? Our healthcare services and education quality improving? Or are we talking about how much rich foreigners are willing to bring $$ into Singapore, jacking up housing prices and prices of everyday goods?
When the average Singaporean son sacrifices 2 years of his life for the country, he firstly and foremost protects the interests of people in positions of power and wealthy elites, as a matter of fact. And he gets little in return. Things you learn in NS, you can rarely ever apply it to a corporate job. Not mention how NS destroys the psyche and impairs the long term mental health of NSFs esp if you're not an officer or commander. It brainwashes you into obedience to authority, puts you in the position where you're the bottom barrel of society, and delays 2 years of your career progression while others have already graduated when you begin your university. It destroys the self esteem to a great extent.
To all those pro-conscription folks saying that the willingness of sacrificing one's life for their country is a sign of a ""good citizen"", all I can say is that if a country requires their own citizens to lose their lives, that country is not worth protecting in the first place.

61133,108252,"I came across one of Ben's old threads about aptitude and I would like to share a story. Make of it what you will.
I am not smart. I went to a neighborhood school after Nanyang Primary because I flunk my PSLE. I then did poorly for my O-levels. I hated school. I hated everything about it. I hated sitting in the same classroom for hours every day, I hated doing homework, I hated working on practice problems etc. I didn't know why I was a bad student then. I've always put it down to what people have always said about me—I'm stupid. I went straight to NS.
But I did like one thing—chess. I would spend hours playing chess on the computer, hours reading chess books, hours practicing openings and endgames, hours reading about past games of famous players. I have no talent in chess. For 3 straight years upon my first introduction to the game in primary school by my father, I lost to him. He was not a chess player. By the end of secondary school (evidently at the expense of my school work), I was competing in tournaments and beating the majority of my opponents. This was my first life lesson in how one can overcome his lack of talent. 
At 18 I decided that I wanted to focus on my studies to get into a good university. Probably important to note, my parents are very rich. After communicating this to them, I set chess aside, retook my O-levels, did well, and they sent me to attend an IB program in the UK. It was hard. My brain was slow, my attention span was poor, but I did want to succeed and that made me persist. I put myself on an extremely rigid schedule and I averaged 6 hours a sleep for two years straight. I took no days off. The result of this was a perfect 45/45 and I made it to a top 2 engineering school in the US. I'm also an FM and I play for the university chess team.
Note: I am still stupid. I always leave lectures with the feeling of ""I have no idea what I just sat through."" I typically have to spend several days mulling stuff over, working through practice problems, even re-watching old lectures of my introductory classes because I forget stuff. Since I been at college, I don't average 6 hours of sleep every day. I sneak 30-min naps throughout a day but I do pull all-nighters regularly. This doesn't seem to be the case with most of my peers, but I have definitely met people here who are here simply by virtue of their relentlessness.
Hard work can compensate for bad hardware to some degree. What Ben said was consistent with my experience. Smart kids do learn a lot quicker. If you're both smart and a workaholic, you'd probably be as good a student as Ben was. But for those who are lugging a Pentium chip, if you want to make it, you just have to sacrifice everything and work. And perhaps this is how I got in at my college in the first place. This is a place where students are known for their almost masochistic work ethic.
Now that I've started working, I am the associate partner at my firm. How did I get here? Simple. I don't stop working. I am first to arrive and last to leave. It has worked for my all my life and there's no reason why it shouldn't continue. You just work. There's no reason why you should spend time mulling over whether you have aptitude or not.

61085,108153,"You know what I noticed? I am on the second level of the attractiveness scale. It's like I'm in limbo, not quite hot enough to be the hot girls' first choice, but hot enough to be their rebound when they get dumped by their first choice. Now every time a hot girl is interested in me, I have to figure out what her problem is. 
For instance, there was once a gorgeous girl with long smooth hair, sharp features and a fit and slender body that was shapely in the right areas. We hit it off pretty quick. In fact, she was the one who started talking to me, asked for my number and even paid for our first dinner! Unfortunately, it soon became apparent how such a perfect creature could even be single in the first place. When she got mad about something, oh boy were you in for a ride. Her outbursts were fiery and completely disproportional. It was hard to fathom how one person could be two people so diametrically opposed to each other. And so with a heavy heart, I had to move on. I could not imagine myself being long-term with a girl of such temperament, handsome though she may have been, and I can imagine the guys before me reasoned as much.
And then there was another girl. Beautiful by any conventional standards, cute and fit with glowing hair and zero entitlement. How rare is it to find a drop dead gorgeous cutie who doesn't demand anything? In fact, she was more willing to give me stuff - gifts, food, time etc. - than she was to take from me. We did lots of things together, she was respectful and helpful and we shared our thoughts and desires and everything. Oh, the way people stared at us in the streets. But alas, I discovered that I was the rebound after her breakup of a long-term relationship. She was biding her time and eventually got back with the dude. Oh well.
With other girls though, I've had somewhat of a different experience. But maybe that's a story for another time...

So my friend had a bad breakup early last year. While she has been very proactive in dealing with the aftermath (trying new hobbies, spending more time with her family, even seeing a psychiatrist), I think that she also hampers her own efforts by (1) having a really low bar for online dating in an attempt to find a new bf and (2) still talking about her ex. I mean, for (1) I've lost count of how many times I literally had to point out so many red flags in the text screenshots. I would say some of them are even worse than your ex. (2) WHY THE FLYING HECK ARE YOU TELLING ME ABOUT WHAT YOU HEAR D ABOUT HIM?? He gaslighted you throughout the entire r/s and caused you to faint from stress multiple times but you still interested in his life for what???
Knowing her she is both forward-looking and introspective, but more often than not it gives rise to behaviour I don't understand, such as trying to find new gossip about people she fell out with like years back?? Like what would you gain out of this at all?? Then of course when her ex became one of these people this behaviour just got worse and even affected her health??
I'm damn exhausted. Been trying to advise her so many times but she just continues to ""date"" shitty guys and periodically spiral over her ex. I think her psychiatrist also got problem, almost coming to 2 years and this idiot still keeps taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back.

I kept the friendship going because of a mutual good friend who begged to keep X around. X is constantly negative and overthinks about every situation all the time. When no one is looking or even thinking about her, she would come up with length speeches of her paranoia about her appearance or body and how people see her. No amount of assurance can make her feel better. I'm very tired of X and had since reduced contact with my good friend whenever X is present. 
The group chat of us 3 is worse. I almost never read it because its constant whining about her insecurities and fishing us to give her more assurance which doesn't work. My good friend finds it hard to reject X so has been a listening ear and supportive pillar of strength to X. But time passes, even my good friend is tired of listening to X. There's no give and take when it comes to X. She's so bloody needy all the time and demanding of our attention over her endless worries. 
Other than leaving her alone, I don't know what to do because X constantly inserts herself in me and my good friend's conversation.  
How to make her stop whining? It's hard to cut her out of our lives now because we still have to see each other everyday.

61094,108177,"My Voice Before I Exit
Previously I couldn’t tell anyone because no one bothered to hear my side of the story. Everyone just joined in to bully and slut shame me because I was an easy target. This is my story before I exit . I may be here today I may not be tomorrow. It is just my last wish to have my side heard not be  blamed to absorb all the damages . 
My bullying existed since 2010 and it was been nearly 12 years of pain , anxiety and untreated trauma. 
It actually happened when I was still a minor . I was only 15 studying in secondary school.  I was talking to a guy but back then my bff another girl also liked him so she told everyone I stole her bf which I didn’t. She wasn’t even with him. 
To stop the bullying I was forced to apologise to her even though I didn’t do it . Then everyone thought cos I apologised I really stole her bf . 
What’s worse is she planned worse . She told me her guy friend was interested in me so I agreed to meet him . He tried to sexually groom me and one day he took me to his room because he wanted to play computer games with me . I was naive and young back then so i trusted him.  That guy took a topless video of me without my knowledge and without my consent through a hidden camera when I was only 15. He released it during my o level period with that girl to crash me. 
Because of it , I was bullied so severely I had to quit my poly . I was a top A student in secondary school and because of her jealousy she and him destroyed me . 
No one helped me during my trauma in secondary school. Because I was a nerd and always studied and kept to myself mostly . She and him knew my weakness . 
I tried going to the police but they shut down my case saying it was a he say she say thing , they told me an IO just went down to ask that guy , any obvious idiot would deny it . 
I was so traumatised that my mother brought me to see a psychiatrist at CGH. That doctor fed me anti psychotic drugs like I was a lab rat , back then those drugs were experimental and he gave me a pamphlet about the side effects it had, the dosage he gave made me go insane and I lose my senses , it also made me hyper sexualized . 
In the end I hurt guys while I was in that state . I did apologise to those guys for nearly causing sexual diseases and I acknowledged my mistake even though I had already lose my senses , I blamed myself and took the punishment but the bullying never ended . That was 5 years ago. I was slut shamed, sexualised and harassed everywhere in public and in office by men because of my mistakes.  I feel that I have been punished enough. 
In the end I had to visit a private psychiatrist to be fixed , the drugs from the private clinic had better purity than those in public , the doctor himself told me the publicly supplied drugs have too many fillers therefore caused more side effects .  You pay so much for that difference of quality and safety. The drugs temporarily helped but it cannot be taken forever . Those drugs have side effects and long term lead to drug dependency, doctor himself is ethical and told me to fight the bullying and reduce the dosage. 
But my bullies never let go of me. It had been 12 years since that topless video was spread but recently someone spread it again. It brought back a lot of childhood trauma . Felt so helpless when the police back then dismissed my case due to lack of evidence . Felt so traumatised when I was blamed for it and slut shamed , they even jeered at me saying I deserved it , I deserved to go crazy . 
I cried so much , because I realised now that they bullied me because I was weak , it wasn’t because I was really that way , so I felt like ending my life .
Even though I was going through all these I still went to work and faced these attacks on a daily basis , I can’t recover like this . There were some others who tried to reach out to me and help me but we ended up being harrassed together and everyone gave up. The environment is harsh. 
People who know are not helping me , felt that if the environment was kinder to me I could still hang on , but it was different , I was slut shamed further . That guy just got away and living his life Scot free , so is the girl .  Derek Lee and Gina Ng . 
Feel abandoned in a big bad world .  I know there are still nice and kind ppl in SG but I have met too many bad ones . To this day , I am sorry to the guys I have hurt while I was in a mentally unstable state. 
But I do want to give up and not feel grief and pain anymore . People who want to suicide do not want to kill themselves but to kill the pain . 
Good bye , my world and future has fallen apart . It is only a matter of time .
