61156,108295,"I was days away from my proposal to my ex-gf. She has this avoidant dismissive personality. She dreams to be a tai tai and I have no issues with that. She recently quit her job and wanted me to temporarily support her. I couldn’t provide much but I would offer to pay for meals, etc. on top of that, she expects me to pay for almost everything because she’s “not working”. We often quarrelled about money because both of us have very differing views about money. To me, money is just like a commodity, it’s plastic. What’s more important is the experience we spent tgt. One day, she told me that she would feel more secure if I were to put some money with her. I was super hesitant but one night, thinking that I would spent the rest of my life with this girl (days away from proposal and house paid for already), I trf her everything I had >$10k and only kept $1k for my own expenses. 
The very next day she wanted a break up and insisted that the money was a gift to her. In my WhatsApp message, I had explicitly stated that this money is for our wedding, house, Reno, etc. 
I really want back the money and think that she’s a gold digger but she claims she isn’t. Can anyone advise what can be done?

61154,108290,"I’ve been tgt with my bf for 10 years and I basically wear the pants in the rs not bcs I’m the domineering one but my bf mindset is not the kind that would plan ahead or would just decide on anything so naturally, I have to volunteer doing all the planning etc. However, just awhile back my mum told me not to rush into things as she started to have a h2h talk with me and really felt like my bf isn’t ready with his finances and career. Even tho, we’ve been tgt for abt 10 years, I felt like my mum wasn’t approving of him like his phase in life becos he took the longest track which is ITE, Poly and then Uni. So by the time he grad, he’d rly be close to 30 alr and haven’t started working but I’d have accomplished much more or maybe even job hopping to get a higher pay raise which I would then feel the imbalance and the difference. I do see him in my future and that was why I want to get a bto first with him but now, her questions are ringing in my head, will I end up being the payor of the house? Or mostly everything? Meals? I need to take care of my mum and my grandma sometimes.. I can’t afford to foot the bills whenever I’m with my bf. We haven’t talked abt this becos whenever I try to communicate with him, he always brushes me off as he’s afraid of the future too and just says “if it happens, then think later”. Sometimes, his attitude rly turn me off like I don’t feel he loves me as much as I love him but he might also be feeling v stressed over sch and stuff.. I just want some assurance and then there you have my mum saying all these trying to make me have second thoughts on this man. What shld I do now?

61165,108320,"would someone be willing to explain to me why are some girls so shameless and disgusting?? going after a taken guy and requesting him on social media knowing he has a girlfriend .. sitting beside him during staff dinners and photos like you are trying to stand a chance?? 
i have always been a girls support girls person but this girl is getting on my nerves these days. I have never met someone like this before and i am fumbled by the audacity of this person's behaviour. 
Can someone advice if i should genuinely be concerned about this or just let it go. My boyfriend on the other hand is someone who likes attention and has hard time saying no but he does tell me when i ask and does not lie (sometimes) . I have not been in a rs since 2017 and this is my 2nd rs in my 20yrs of living and this is my first time encountering such experience. 
My boyfriend also used to kept his ex gf in his spam acc without me and lied to me by saying that it was only for the boys and that was the reason he could not accept my following which i found out, turned into a huge fight .. he was sorry bla bla and we got over it. I got over it because i saw that he actually posted me on his spam acc altho i dont know why he could not accept me?? 
There was this one time when i went out to eat with him and as i was getting up to queue for his food, in that span of time he liked someone's picture while i was beside him and he was cranky the whole time we ate.. this hurt me alot btw but i did not said much. 
idk if my bf is the problem or my overthinking is the problem. and that girl that have been snaking around his workplace trynna get something from my bf.. what am i supposed to do wit her or just let them be.

My mum said that she chose to marry my dad even though he was poor, because he was responsible, honest and hardworking. So fast forward 20+ years, he has been a good father and is very good to us. However, recently he has been going out late at night, which he says is to drink with his friends to destress due to work stress. But he has also been behaving weirdly and paying alot of attention to his appearance. I was getting too suspicious so one day i decided to look at his phone (i know its wrong) and saw that he had a whatsapp chat with a young woman, and their chat were just quite flirtatious, like asking whether she was ok because she drank alot etc. after reading it i was really hurt and disappointed because i hate cheating and would never condone it. But i am also not sure how to move forward because my mum relies on him and i know that this will hurt her deeply. I just feel so helpless and dont know what to do.

61168,108326,"I like reading about so called intellectuals trying to quantify their version of success. It really scares me that almost everyone use money as a form of benchmark. Is that the hallmark of a Singaporean? 
A bit of me. I was once extremely smart. I didn’t finish my education properly only because I got unlucky with my roll of dice of life. I get to mix with a lot of people. That’s when I realised there’s 2 groups of people, street smart and book smart. You can get yourself educated up till PhD but you probably still can’t understand how to make the best out of the people under you. At the same time, I know of hardworking individuals who became millionaires through their businesses. 
I’m lucky to have met so many smart individuals. I know of a Physics prof who is so cool and laid back. He didn’t care if people think of him as a stupid person. He didn’t feel the need to flex his PhD. A random person on the street will probably think of him as a normal ah pek and he’s chill about that. He’s definitely one of my idols. 
One thing I learn in life is that there are many versions of success. What is success to me is probably not success to you. Despite having only A levels, I was lucky enough. I was able to accumulate a wealth of almost a million in under 5 years. Lucky because I sold my HDB flat and got onto the nice bull run a few years back. I was also quite involved in a gig job that pays me $10-15k/mth. 
I had a simple target, 1m for retirement. Once I hit that, I got out. And yes, lucky again, because after cashing out, the market crashed. I was lucky that I bought a lot of crypto investments that didn’t fail. 
So am I bragging? Partially yes. The main point I wanna focus on is not being greedy. I’m all set for retirement at a young age because I don’t really chase money. I enjoy the process of investing and I was careful about choosing the right product that resonates with me. The profit is just a byproduct. 
One thing I learn about investing from my ex colleague is to earn money, you shouldn’t be obsessed with money. Focus on the process, and you’ll eventually make money. 
That’s when I went back to school. It’s so cute to see my schoolmates being obsessed with As. They just love competing for the best grades. On the other hand, I enjoy seeing some others helping each other out. These are the real talents. There are too many smart people already. Kindness is a rare virtue these days. These students will have a lot of friends supporting them on their way up. 
As for me, I’m just finishing my studies here for the fun of it. Took my fav subject just because. Gonna be $30k poorer which probably won’t increase my income further. Being educated allows you to earn more but most probably didn’t realise that being educated doesn’t make you smarter or better than most others. There’s no need to quantify and rank accordingly. 
If you wanna be rich, do business. Most don’t have the guts to do it anyway. Everyone likes to think they are special. It’s only right for them to feel so. That’s how you will feel purposeful in this world. 
For me, I’m still enjoying my life eating prata with my teh tarik. That’s how I like to enjoy most of my time. Annual euro trips is mainly because, she wants it and girl math, it’s cheaper to buy luxury goods there than in Singapore. 
Personally, I’m just enjoying my time listening to as much music as possible, watching concerts, watching movies. I’m just enjoying that I have the luxury of time for all these. I have friends going on yachts and such. Like I say, different people have a different version of success. 
For me, my version of success is being as healthy as possible to live a long life and having all the time in the world to do things that I like. Time is more precious than money, only because your time is finite and time will even become more precious tomorrow than today. 
It can be quite intimidating hearing the thoughts of highly intellectuals. I guess not everyone can enjoy their rich lives. I’m just happier doing my own things at my own pace. Tbh, I have no idea what’s my next move after graduation. I’m considering giving back to my community. I think that’s probably something that I’ll want to do next. 
 Most important of all, I’m just thankful to be born in Singapore. That’s the biggest luck factor that allow me to ‘succeed’ in life. You can argue about Singapore being too expensive, but it’s worth it! And that’s exactly why I believe Singaporeans are all successful in their own different ways. It’s just scary when intelligence and wealth are being used as a form of benchmark for individuals. 
To end, I believe luck is the most important factor in your life. Being born in Singapore. Being born to a good family. That’s luck too! Sometimes, you can make your own luck. Put yourself more out there, do things outside of your comfort zone. Keep on trying, and you’ll test the boundaries of your luck. My friends always tell me that I am very lucky. But deep down, I know that I’m a go getter. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. Just enjoy life for what it is, ffs! May the odds be ever in your favour.

61152,108286,"Advice needed ‼️
I have known this girl since secondary 1 and had gotten closer to her after secondary 4 when a three person friend group was formed (2 guys 1 girl). It has been 6 years since the friend group was formed and we are very close to one another where we will often meet at least once a week.
However, recently, I started having romantic feelings towards her and this is where it gets troublesome. I am not sure whether I should pursue her/let her know how I feels or I should just keep my feelings to myself.
I feels that she will never and has never looked at me romantically because we have been friends for such a long time. Also, she always tends to look at good looking guys and have like a kinda high expectation on the guys she will like to date but I am definitely not that ideal guy. I really feel that I do not have the chance but do still want to let her know how I feel about her or at least have her give me a chance to pursue her.
BUT! What if after I shared my feelings to her… will we still able to be very close friends like before? Will the friend group break? I cant afford to have this friend group to disperse as they are very important individuals in my life.
What should I do?

Husband was a boyfriend of 6 years before we got married for 5 years. I just had my motorcycle license when I first got together with my boyfriend. 
He didn’t have  the need to take one because he was against riding. We used to argue and take public transport instead of us riding because he kept insisting it isn’t safe. He felt anxious on the bike until years later when he got used to it. He then said it’s convenient to ride than taking public. He used to tell me not to split lane so I tried not to whenever he was my pillion. 
When covid strikes and he was out of a job. He took riding lessons to work as a grab delivery rider. Now that he has his motorcycle license. His comments about my riding got worst. Telling me I am a reckless rider and he doesn’t feel safe whenever he was my pillion. Like excuse me? You rode with me for 8 years before you own one and never once you commented that and now I am reckless? My way of riding never changed. 
I got upset with him. Like why would he say that? Why would I want to put his life in danger? Why would I want to put my life in danger? It doesn’t make sense. I told him I wouldn’t want him as my pillion anymore. He could ride his own bike and I will ride mine or whenever we are taking only one bike, I wouldn’t want to pillion him. He told me I got defensive and he doesn’t understand why. Now he is upset because I got upset at him being upset at me. (If you get the drift) 
It is super annoying. He doesn’t have a driver’s licence but each time I drove, he will keep commenting “Why I don’t give way? Why must I drive fast? Can you please be careful.” I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE ROAD ALSO CANNOT LA! 
I told him off. Now I told him, get your license. I am not driving anymore. You can drive all you want. He is upset with me and ignoring me now. AITA?

61147,108277,"(lengthy post ahead)
At the age of 22 in 2020 (Year 2 NUS Female), my mum had depression, which prompted my dad to quit his job to take care of my mum. Since that year, I was silently forced into the only breadwinner of the family. While studying, I took on part-time jobs and internships while studying to save up for allowance, give my parents some money and save to pay for my tuition fees. It has been very tiring but I endured throughout.  I did not tell friends about my situation and they thought I was just hardworking. By the end of Year 4, I have 4 internships including a long term part-time job that made my resume stood out. My sincerity and hard work landed me good testimonials written by my  Managers from my first 2 internships. 
Fast forward to Dec 2021, my last internship was a nightmare to me as my supervisor was very overbearing, I cried a lot silently and bearer her throughout. I cannot quit as it was a graded FYI. Towards the end of the 4th internship, there was finally light at the end of the tunnel. That was at least something I thought! I was thankful to have found a FT job shortly after I graduated from NUS. For the sake of money to provide a better living for my family, I accepted the  FT job immediately. The pay was 3.5k (average pay for my degree). Little did I know it is just a beginning my nightmare.
My immediate supervisor  micromanaged me a lot, scolded me a lot and didn’t give me face when scolding me in front of other colleagues. My reputation went down. The only good side is my reporting officer is very understanding in his words. Nevertheless he still side my immediate supervisor as she is a top-performer in the company. Throughout 1 year plus, I lost weight and dreaded work but I cannot quit for fear that my family income will hit 0 as the only breadwinner in the family. 
Concurrently in Jun 2022, I met my first love through my childhood friend and we got together in Dec 2022. He was someone who I can turn to about family issues and has similar goals and values as me. Whenever I felt so tired from working and carrying family burden, I endure throughout the weekdays and weekends have always been my greatest pleasure to hang out with him.  He was just like my best friend and a reliable partner. I treat his parents as if they are my parents. Whenever I have nice food, I would bring it over to their house to share. 
Little did I know in Feb 2023, I realise he has been cheating on me all these while and worst of all, his family and that childhood friend  who introduced me to him have known about it and had been hiding the issue from me. I have never felt so hurt in my heart. My world came crushing down. He apologised and and I forgave him. Then a few months down the road, I discovered him seeing another girl again. I blocked him and he came to my house to apologise to me. As I was kind-hearted, I choose to forgive him and let it slide. The last straws were:
(1) Caught a random bonquet of flower at his house. He cannot explain what the flowers are for and his mum has to jump in to “cover up” for him. EPIC fail!!
(2) He brought me to a friends’ gathering session and openly checked out other girls. Neither did he introduced me to the rest, I was left transparent there!!!
(3) Lying about his whereabouts, only to find out he was going on dates.
In Jun 2023, I mustered courage to totally cut off from him and walk away. It was never easy, he came back sometimes to check in and I just ignored him. 
I was low key disappointed because when our mutual friends (from other clique) knew about the breakup, they sided him. They obviously did not know about his cheating affair and chose to side him. I felt that there was no point for myself to fight for my say since they don’t believe me.
Currently in Nov 2023 (25 years old, female), I decided to take my power back. Having minimal friends doesn’t matter, what matters is that I have my own back.  What keeps me going is still my obligation to provide for my family. I am still learning, but I would never give up. I have been attending counselling session to cope with my feelings and situation. What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.  
Thanks for listening.

He suddenly stopped replying me and before that a guy friend of mine told me that he will just talk to me to keep me interested before ghosting me one day once he gets bored. This turned out to be true and a few weeks later this guy dropped me a text asking me how am i doing. I'm just wondering if I should even reply him because the last time he just disappeared like that, i felt really bad and feel that he wasn't very genuine in forming a true connection even as friends.

61160,108304,"TLDR: What should I focus for the short/mid term in my career?
Hey guys, NUS alum here. I just recently moved to a new tech co as an entry level DA earning 8k+ per month. I started my first job 3 years ago earning below 4k per month so I consider myself quite fortunate to achieve this current level of salary.
Recently, I have been feeling a bit troubled knowing that my job title is still an entry level while my some of my peers have climbed up to senior or even assistant manager level. They started working at the same time as me and have stayed in their co since then while I have changed jobs for a few times, most recently due to retrenchment.
The thing is, I don’t foresee staying in my current job for long as I’m not passionate in the industry my co is in. I signed on simply cos it’s a no-brainer to have a well-paying job in today’s economy rather than being jobless like the past 4 months for me. I was even ready to settle for less salary to work in a role I am passionate in.
So with all these things considered, what would be your career advice for me? One option I’m considering as well is to go for a career break to study a master degree. I feel I shouldn’t delay it too long or else I won’t ever get it.

61148,108278,"Response to #108252:
I’m one of Prof Ben’s former schoolmates at RI and this is a reply to his comment. I’ve been in the C-suite at a multinational for more than 10 years now I’m retired. I also graduated top 5 of my cohort at one of the most prestigious pure mathematics departments in the world. I think I am somewhat qualified to opine (at least on the industry side). I also don’t want this to sound like a rebuke, because it’s not. I actually agree with him on some level.
Agree that IQ matters a lot less the higher you go in most jobs. Yet, from what I gather, people with good management skills are a lot scarcer than people who are good technically. My company hired a lot of life science and biomedical science PhDs from Harvard, Stanford, Hopkins. You’d think these people are few and far between but we can always replace a scientist; it’s nearly impossible to replace a good middle manager. It is problematic because we have a million different ways to measure intellectual “horsepower” but we don’t have any metric for management skills. I don’t have a reliable way to find good managers. 
There are several takeaways from my career that I hope can be useful for the readers here. Aptitude does exist but it is a combination of what counts for raw intellectual power, interest, work ethic, and many other things we don’t yet know. It is easy to put it down as a simple “stupid-smart dichotomy.” In reality, not being interested in something or not putting in the work manifests rather similarly as not being smart enough. I had several schoolmates at university who were a lot smarter than me but they graduated in the bottom of the class. Not enough work, too much beer. 
Bear in mind, “geniuses work hard too.” In mathematics, the most famous in recent history is Terry Tao. A lowly math enthusiast like me couldn’t possibly be compared to the legend himself, but I’m pretty sure I’m closer to Terry in IQ than I am in industriousness or in inventiveness. In his early years, people would have probably spent less time awake than he spent doing math. Important to note: Ben was the best student not only because he has a good brain, he was also a peerless hard-worker. 
A couple of things about luck, which Ben mentioned as well. I knew at an early age that I will be doing a math degree. I did IMO and I liked doing math for fun. There was a straight line for me and it was out of pure luck that we are all taught math at a young age. If I had been a secret genius in marine micropaleontology, I would have perhaps ended up as a mediocre civil engineer with an exotic coral collection. Having said that, none of my jobs post-graduation had anything remotely to do with pure mathematics (number theory and algebraic geometry). 
The way people talk about IQ lacks a lot of nuance. IQ itself isn’t understood well and I have spent some time on the literature. There is still a lot to distill in that space. We don’t know how much of one’s ability to learn is explained by this concept of *brain power* and how much is explained by one’s dispositions and all behaviors related to the trait conscientiousness. Interest measures motivation and discipline is work without motivation. I do believe there is such a thing as innate smartness but I don’t know how useful it is apart from being a way to explain away why someone is putting in the work and not getting the result. It’s not the whole picture. There are many ways to look at this, one of which is pretty obvious—you’re working but it’s mostly unproductive work. If you stared at your textbook for 18 hours without intention, you’ve worked 18 hours but you learned nothing because your heart isn’t in it. Why isn’t your heart in it? Possibly because you chose CS after reading about $250,000 starting salaries at Google and not because you were even remotely interested. This has nothing to do with aptitude you’re just in the wrong place.
Being thoughtful about your interests is more important than just working hard. There’s no point pursuing a high-paying industry to be a 10th-percentile worker because there’s a chance you will make no more than a gas station attendant working the graveyard shift. The head of the business development division cleared $1.25M the last year I worked there. She majored in English at a Canadian university. Ben would probably think that her job doesn’t require a lot of IQ, but I wouldn’t survive a day in her shoes. She is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met precisely because she is able to pick up on nuances and cues that I just don’t. If you think about it this is kinda like everything else—some people just pick up certain things quicker than others. 
This brings me to my most important point, the term “intellectual horsepower” should be taken to mean field-specific intellectual horsepower or skill. I’m sure a generalized intellectual baseline exists but I believe that there is a much bigger variable component that is determined by other factors, including interest, discipline, and industriousness. Every single one of my friends who are now surgeons and doctors will fail my degree at my university. Likewise I will not make it through a medical degree. I find medicine incredibly boring. I also failed chemistry in secondary school. Question, how could you fail chemistry weren’t you an IMO medalist? The answer is simple—when I’m in a chemistry class I don’t understand s***. It’s entirely possible to be stupid in one area and very strong in another. It’s also possible to be stupid in all areas or strong in all areas. 
The important thing is to remember, whether you’re smart or not, whether you have aptitude or not, the strategy is the same—you work hard. If the strategy is the same, you don’t get hung up on what your brain power is. By the way, and this is not a dig, it’s curious that only those in academia keep talking about intelligence and brain power. Lower-beings like me? We got something way more interesting we use to overcompensate—frequent flyer miles.

61157,108296,"Living with my folks at 30, no big deal, right? But lately, it's been getting a bit tricky with my mom. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate everything she does, but she's been diving into my personal space like a detective on a case.
I mean, who I'm texting, where I'm going, who I'm hanging out with - it's all under her radar. The weirdest part? She's started texting my friends, asking about my whereabouts. Honestly, it's embarrassing. Feels like she's morphed into an obsessed girlfriend rather than a mom.
I get it, she cares, but I need some space, you know? It's time to rein it in a bit, move from the detective mode to more of a mother-son vibe. Love her to bits, but a bit of breathing room wouldn't hurt.
How? Any solution how to tell her off? It's getting into my nerves.

61149,108282,"Find it kind of weird that people are taking career advice from professors. Yes I’m going to ask about the corporate world from a bunch of people who avoided corporate jobs like a plaque by spending an incredibly long time getting a PhD and then go on to do research and teach 20 year-olds for 20 years. 
NUS should bring in real industry experts from time to time like what they do at Harvard Business School. My father has been a big law partner for more than 10 years and his advice has very consistently contradicted the views of my law professors, some of whom have doctoral degrees from schools like Oxford. I would venture to guess that my father knows more about making partner than my professor who is more of a legal scholar than a lawyer. The funny thing is, professors often can’t help themselves but opine on the industry even though a lot of them have only ever been an academic. 
A minority of professors have industry experience, I accept that. But how much experience do you really have if you’re a full-time professor and do some industry work on the side from time to time? I don’t know. I’m not saying don’t take advice. I’m saying take advice from people who have actually done what you’re trying to accomplish.

61155,108293,"Good day everybody,
As the title suggest, I need your advise. I am being accused by my prof for plagiarism.
Story:
It is the last assignment for my module. It is kind of like a math module which you need to do a lot of proving like writing essays and writing many mathematical equations. My last few assignments had been very untidy and the English to explain my answer was not very good too. So for the last assignment I used chatgpt to write out the notations and used it to fixed my English as well. I checked the rules of the assignment and the prof never mentioned that you cannot use A.I tools to help you in this aspect. So I took a screenshot of the answer and put it in my document since I wrote the initial answer and it only helped me out on the English side and the mathematical notations. When the prof first confront me, I was very upfront with the prof and did not hide the fact that I used it to fix my English and write mathematical notations. He wants to see my GPT chat history which unfortunately I always delete after using as I don't want to keep irrelevant chats to mess up the dashboard. I asked him is there anythingelse I can do? (E.g maybe he wants me to go down to explain my situation, workings etc. I am fine with that or maybe provide the hard copy scratch working)
Long story short, he did not propose anything, does not believe me and did not address any of the points I wrote in my email. Now he wants to escalate it.
I have not been able to focused on the many finals I had, I have trouble sleeping and eating because I am being accused for something I know I did not do. The situations looks very bad, please give me some advise.
Edit: The prof never say anything, he says he want to bring this case to UG office. That's all for now.

61153,108289,"Anybody has suggestions for psychotherapists/counsellors? Have been seeing a counsellor in the private practice for a few sessions and although it is working well (first counsellor who got me after trying out at least 5 diff counsellors since I graduated), it is getting too expensive as I am unemployed and I dunno how long it will last. I am decreasing my frequency of counselling with her significantly as I dun want to be stressed abt cost of counselling on top of job hunting. Will appreciate recommendations from both private and subsidised practices. For subsidised practices, will appreciate if you can provide the counsellor's name as I had bad experience with subsidised options, general takeaway is those assigned to me are always inexperienced and dun seem to follow the flow of convo/dun want to process things together/have a fixed plan to follow and awkwardly try to direct me to follow when i am dying to just let things out/used 1 full hr to equip me with grounding tips. Or maybe I just have no luck. XD I hope to follow recommendations as much as possible this time round as it will be a long-term, costly investment and I am losing faith in counselling at this rate (close to 5 yrs of trying out... either dunno how to do their job or too ex). There are a few reddit threads on counselling options but they dun list drop counsellors. Thank you!

Every few weeks this topic comes up and I don't see people being very academic/scientific about it. Here's a clue, read; instead of vehemently trying to change or argue against the opinions of an associate professor whose specialty is actually computer science—not neuroscience or psychology. 
Yes, the existence of raw basic intelligence is not a settled science. There are many theories and many experiments. And then you have all sorts of confounders that make it difficult to ascertain whether intelligence is so intrinsic to a person that things like motivation plays little to no part in its determination. Then you have the challenge of measuring intrinsic motivation, i.e how interested is someone in learning any particular thing. So sure, if it makes you feel better, the jury is actually out on intelligence. All people have are anecdotal evidence. The theory that people seem to have a problem with is the hardware + software theory. I'm guessing people don't like it because it is simplistic and it sounds like something you overhear in the hawker centre. The point I want to argue today is, in practice, it doesn't matter.
The main question we should be asking is: does it really matter that much what the reason is for not doing well? A lazy person can only push himself so far at being hard-working but it is not his natural state and therefore it is not sustainable. Same goes for being unmotivated. Whether or not you have ""horsepower"" is immaterial. If you don't have the physical horsepower nor the temperamental horsepower, you will fail regardless. People need to be more cognizant of the fact that you don't have to force yourself to do something you're not good at or you don't like. If you're not good at physics, for whatever reason, who actually is forcing you to do physics? Does it matter if the reason you're not good at physics is because you have poor logical-mathematical intelligence or if you're just naturally very lazy? You can't really fix the latter either. 
My field is physics and I have a doctorate from Berkeley. We're lucky because people don't really pick physics unless they are passionate about it since there is not a lot of income premium here. So what you don't have is a whole bunch of undergraduates who are forcing themselves to do well in something they wouldn't have done if not for the money. Interest/motivation goes a long way. If you're not smart enough to be a world-class programmer, pointing it out to you is not a form of gatekeeping. You could be very smart in some other thing but you're wasting your talent in CS. If your only reason for wanting to be a software engineer is the pay, you're not looking at the problem strategically. In the long run, you can make a lot more money doing something you're good at and like doing.
By the way, being very smart is not the way to make a lot of money. I am a post-doc and I make peanuts. I have an uncle in Malaysia who distributes chemical cleaning products and he makes well over $1M a year in profit. It is actually counterproductive to be very technically gifted if you want to be rich. These people tend to focus too much on the work and not enough on the business. Yes, engineers and scientist have built wonderful technology that benefit all of humanity. But the people getting rich are not them. It's probably some rich VC guy with a mansion in the Hamptons with an art history degree. There also a massive luck factor. So, honestly, intelligence is just one of those things that is fun to brag about but doesn't translate to very much in personal material utility.

61162,108310,"I am beginning my PhD soon in Environmental Engineering in NUS, and I am interested in looking at applications of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning in the field of Environment and sustainability. I understand that I can take a couple of modules from outside my department. I am interested in taking a couple of modules on AI and Machine learning, just to know the basics if it, know what kinds of models are out there and the mechanics of how they work. This will help me decide what kind of applications I can apply machine learning to. 
My question is, does anyone have any recommendations for specific modules that I can take to learn the basics of AI and ML and learn about what models exist and how to use them? 
My undergrad was also in engineering and I have no formal AI or ML training. But I taught myself to code in R and learned how to do machine learning regression using R pretty well. But all my knowledge is from blogs and random websites online, which is why I am looking for some formal education on the subject. Even though I know how to do ML regression, I would like to know what other things one can do using ML. I have about 2 years experience coding using R, so any module that uses R is strongly preferred. 
Please advise.
