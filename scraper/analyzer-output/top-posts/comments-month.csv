59415,104714,"I'm with my girlfriend for 3 years. She's been bugging me to marry her and its really starting to stress me out. I didn't tell her I actually have a 6 figure savings accumulated from my deceased father's will on top of my own assets and let her think I'm a pauper. She even gave me money once when she thought my family finances was tight but I rejected it. A part of me decided she is the one after she did that.
My mother told me to never flaunt our wealth so as not to attract the wrong people so I guess I start to feel funny about money since young. We mostly go to hawkers and only visit restaurants when there is a special occasion like birthdays or Christmas. Our dates are usually very low costs. I like that when the weather permits, we have the habit of alighting earlier from the train or bus and spend more time walking together and talking to reach our destination.
I lied to her that we can't afford a flat yet and she showed hand me her savings and say she can and kept asking me not to waste her time in a joking way. Her family is pretty well to do. Her dad even gifted her a car when she got promoted but she sold it as she's not confident driving.
The problem I have with my gf may be insignificant to some couples. I don't really have any major red flags or issues about her. Even if she's not my gf, I would think of her as a great person to have around. I know other men will find her very eligible given her looks, personality and family background. My mother loves her and already considers her a daughter in law. But I have a but. I'm not ready. We are in our late 20s.
How do you become ready? I'm so in love with her but I just couldn't make myself get down on one knee and ask for her hand in marriage.

59530,104917,"I'm currently dating a teacher for about 2 years, who is 3 years into the job (after PGDE). While we really love each other and are serious about one another, I'm a bit uncertain about our future together due to her workload and commitment to work.
Here is a sample of her average day:
Wake up at 540am
Leave house at 630am
Reach school by 710am
Teach classes till 130-2pm
CCA/ remedials/ meetings/ misc things till 530pm, leave school
Dabao, Reach home at 630pm
Eat dinner and chill to 8pm
Marking from 8 to 1130pm
Shower, etc, till 1230pm
Catch up on emails till 1am then sleep
So based on that, she works maybe 14-15 hours every weekday with just 4.5hrs of sleep and a good day every weekend just to catch up on work that couldn't be completed and lesson plans. Based on her salary, it's just ridiculous how much she has to work for that - Retail and F&B workers are better paid hourly than her.
I've been getting into fights with her and telling her that her lifestyle and is unsustainable as it'll lead to big burnouts and her health will suffer. On the flip end, she says that I'm not a teacher and I'd never understand her line of work.
Also, I realised that a lot of her teacher friends (female), are single well into late 30s and 40s - which I guess its due to their teaching lifestyle. On the flip end, most women I know from my line of work (private) are married by their late 30s.
I sincerely hope MOE can do something to lighten teacher's workloads. While that is wishful thinking, I'm wondering if I could get any advice on how to move forward...or move on.
Frankly I although I love her a lot, she had made it clear that her priority is to be a good teacher. So at the back of my mind, there is always this feeling that she loves teaching more than me.
Also, although we both agreed on having children, based on her workload, I don't see how we would be able to manage as I'm afraid she'll leave majority of the child rearing to me while she continues her passion. My job is way less tiring than hers and honestly I'm earning more than double of her - and in order for me to climb more, I need her to do her fair share of child rearing. I've mentioned to her that if we got married, I'd like for her to take a step back from her overloaded schedule and this was utterly shot down and more quarrels ensured.
So now I'm at a crossroads - should I push on and try to make things work, or try to move on to find someone who able to be more family oriented?

59569,105012,"tldr; AITA when my bf half-cancels on our staycay to attend a friend’s wedding and i’m upset about it?
we booked a staycay in early aug for the last weekend of aug, and this week he just got invited to his friend’s wedding. also, he is unable to bring a +1 as the friend said there are not enough seats. he said that he’ll be going on saturday from 6pm onwards so i’ll be alone all the way until midnight-ish in the room. he said he’ll come back after that and spend the night with me.
Firstly, he accepted the friend’s invite so late minute, and that he did not care about how I’d feel being left alone in the room for half a day when this is supposed to be our staycay. It’s like damn sus for a close friend to send an invitation so last minute. & I don’t think he respects my time and treats me like an option. I’ve turned down my friends’ or family’s invites to go out on that particular weekend because we got our staycay booked. But I don’t think he understands that this is basic respect.
I won’t be upset at all if his friend invited him before we made plans and I won’t stop him from going at all. I just find it very disrespectful for half-canceling on me we agreed to spend the weekend together beforehand. He made it seem like I’m making mountains out of molehills as he’ll be coming back after that.
AITA for being mad about this? Should I be more understanding and cincai to wait in the room for him lol? Please advise. Thank you!

59429,104746,"My father has a mistress on the side and the entire family knows about it. However, my mother advised me to keep quiet for the sake of maintaining the status quo and I reluctantly agree.
However, recently, the mistress developed a long-term medical condition and my father is spending alot of money to try to cure her. As a result, our family finances are badly affected, e.g. our june family vacation had to be cancelled and the COE on my car will not be renewed. Should I still keep quiet about the mistress or is it time for me to do something about it?
Also, another related question: Whenever the mistress is hospitalised, my father always likes to spend the night at the hospital with her. On the other hand, when my mum or I are hospitalized, my father never stays overnight with us. I want to ask: Is sex common when someone of the opposite gender stays the night in your hotel room? In other words, I want to know whether my father is staying overnight just for the s*x or if he loves his mistress more than my mum and me.

59428,104740,"AITA for asking a NS man to stand in the MRT?
ok, so I posted this on AITA a while back but got ripped apart, prob cus of culture differences, so I’m posting here to have a more understanding viewpoint, please be kind and give your honest but fair opinions. :)
I’m from Singapore. In Singapore, all men aged 18-20, with some exceptions/delays, must do their duty and serve national service for 2 years.
A majority of these men live out on some of the islands surrounding Singapore, in camps, where they do jobs to aid in the defence or functions of our country.
These men used to live out there for the full 2 years, with some breaks in between, but now because ppl were complaining they come back into the city every weekend.
These men often use the public transport on Fridays and Sundays, as they book out of their camps on Friday nights, or evenings and return on Sundays.
I have bfs who’ve served NS, respectfully and dutifully, and my father did it too, when it was much harder, and he never complained.
A “tradition” or unspoken rule is that NS men do not sit down on public transport. First reason for this is that they are bearing the coats of arms of our country, second reason is that they’re meant to be serving our country and a lot of people believe they shouldn’t even be out and about in the first place.
The last reason is that they’re men in their physical prime, meaning they can easily be able to stand for a while.
In more recent times these men have been forgetting themselves, and have began to say they deserve to sit because they actually stand for this country. I think that is bullshit because they’re meant to be serving our country, not sitting on their lazy asses.
So I saw a man sitting on friday, full on decked out in army uniform, on his phone while many women and children and elderly were standing. I walked up to him and tapped him on his knee.
At first I was polite, trying to say there were people who needed his seat more, but he was being a baby saying his legs were sore and “dead”. I reasoned with him some more but eventually just demanded that he get up, citing all the reasons above.
People started staring and pulling out their phones, and I pointed out that he had his name on his chest, so he got up and just walked out of the train.
I told my friends about this, and most agreed that I did the right thing and he should’ve stood, but some of my male friends are refusing to talk to me now.
AITA?

59588,105043,"AITA?
I was earning around 60k to 70k per annum for 10 years before quitting to be a sahm. My husband earns more than me. My husband and I paid half each during the initial payment for the house with a remaining loan of 200k. We have separate and joint accounts. He has taken over paying for almost all the expenses for both of us. Including giving me an allowance which I was able to save from it too. We are thrifty, we don't own a car.
During the course of our marriage, he had asked me twice if we can repay some of the home loan, using both our savings. I've obliged as I wanted to ease his burden. I've not need to spend from my own pocket as he's given me a supplementary card for all expenses and he also paylah whenever I pay for things. From kid to house stuff and even my own personal shopping, insurance and other smaller bills he would paylah me sometimes and will do it when I ask too. Basically he's paying for almost everything and I'm grateful for that. I'm also a simple person. I used to buy Chanels and Pradas but have since adjusted my spending habits since becoming a mom. I can live on 500 or less a month if I want to. I don't scrimp when it comes to food. I can buy things on sale but I also won't deprive my child of a new book or toy on birthdays or xmas when my child asks for it.
We won a decent amount not long ago and we used that to fully repay our condo. We are debt free since. We didn't tell anyone about it.
Recently his family member asked if we can invest an amount in their business. Promising huge returns. All along I'm not on good terms with them and I don't trust them either. They have been changing what they do all along. My husband would like us to contribute to show support. He say I got the spare cash, why not? I have a strong feeling their business will fail again and we won't get back single cent. My relatives said me and my husband are the only ones staying in condo, we should give others a chance to upgrade from hdbs. I think it's rubbish talk.
I don't want my husband to help them either. I have plans to work when my child gets older but whatever I have now, it's my own savings. I feel very annoyed his relatives act like I ought to help them. I'm not a big investor so I prefer to keep most of my money in banks. I do share and invest in the same stocks as my husband so even though my husband don't really know the exact amount that I have, he has a rough idea that I have more than 100k. I know its not a lot. But since I'm not working right now, it's my lifeline.

I (24F) has been together with my bf for a year. We also met each other’s parents since the start of our rs. We do visit each other’s houses and hang out in our rooms with the doors closed. So if we wanted to have s*x, it would have happened alr. I had also been on exchange by myself. They are ok with me doing these things with my girl friends.
However, my parents wouldn’t allow me to have a stayover/overseas trip with my bf. Their concern is that I would have s*x with him if this happens. So in order to ‘protect me’, they won’t allow me to spend the night with him. How else, could I convince them to let me physically sleep next time him lol (btw, I reassured them in many ways alr, but to no avail). Thanks!!

59496,104865,"TLDR: Found out fiancé and his fam are planning to get me pregnant
Admin pls don’t filter this, I don’t have anyone to turn to, not even my parents. Trying to keep this short, am in my mid 20s, fiancé in his mid 30s. I enjoy being with him alot. We’ve been tgt for long and l made it clear from the start that I only wanted a child at 30, which he agreed to. Why at such a late age is because I wanted to continue studying after Uni. At present, I’ve gotten my masters and am very contented with my job. Not long after I graduated, fiancé proposed and I noticed some changes. The topic of kids started becoming more frequent. From “see how cute xx’s babies are” to “what will u do if u suddenly got pregnant? You won’t abort the baby right?” Whenever his nephew and niece visited, his parents started joking that I should pop out a playmate for them soon.
A few weeks ago, fiancé drove out to get dinner while I stayed in his room to finish a report on his computer. It’s my fault, I opened his desktop WhatsApp out of curiosity, just wanting to see who he was texting. I totally take the blame at this part. Everything seemed fine until I saw my name mentioned by his dad. I clicked the convo, and it was them exchanging links on how to get a woman pregnant inconspicuously. His dad wrote that he’d done something similar with his mom and she never regretted having more kids than she originally intended so “(my name) will be thankful next time”
I tried to minimise interaction with his fam after that, but still kept things usual. They’ve treated me with a lot of love and kindness, even offering to buy a condo for us when we got engaged. When I brought this issue up with my mom, she echoed the same sentiments that I should have a child as early as possible. She didn’t think there was much to it since fiancé and his fam are generous and well to do, so I’d have a comfortable life. When I talked to my dad, he didn’t support their actions but also advised me it was “dangerous to wait too long”. Right now I’m extremely wary when having sex with fiancé, which he has been requesting more of, in case he tries to pull anything funny. Have hinted and reminded him that I’d like another 4/5 years in the corporate world before having a child, but he brushes it off, jokingly saying that he’s more than ready to be a dad and take care of us, and his family also want to help raise our kids.
I’m not sure how to feel about this situation. I’m furious that no one is taking me seriously or respects my wishes. But I’m also scared to appear demanding and overreacting, with how people are downplaying the issue. I definitely don’t want to lose my fiancé because I still love him. This issue aside, I’ve always viewed him as my ideal partner in life, from looks, personality, charm and intelligence. It’s just that because of our age difference, while he has scaled the corporate ladder and feels comfortable settling down, I’m only just starting out. I wish I could go back in time to stop myself from going through his messages. Am I being selfish for wanting more time before having a child?

Those who are so fat that they need a motorized wheelchair to move around. I also hate fat youngsters.

I'm in my 30s and I find it ridiculous that some friends my age cannot control their weight. Please don't give the excuse about body type or medical when you have no health issues. I have friends who managed to look the same or even start to take care of themselves after having kids. So I don't believe its acceptable to look like a balloon after NS. Diet and exercise plays a huge part for sure. Not caring about these 2 elements just shows that you're lazy.
I have a cousin who was fit during his teenage years. NS improved his shape but he got fatter and fatter after that. Always eat junk food and smoke and drink. I was so shocked to see him recently as he haven't been updating his fb posts for years. He has ballooned to triple his size. His fiance is normal built I wonder how does he not crush her to death when they have sex or if he can even make it stand? His face is so swollen I don't even know where to look when I talk to him. He's literally panting and breathing very hard even while he's seated. Not like he's on a treadmill. And he's not even half way through his 20s.
I wouldn't be able to not do anything about it if I looked like him.

She doesn't drink or smoke. Doesn't eat junk or processed food too. She moved into my place 4 months ago and I find she doesn't seem to be what she says she is.
She fills the kitchen with chips and chocolates. She orders korean alcoholic drinks in cartons and has more than a can every night. The freezer is full of frozen fried food, sweet drinks, snacks and ice cream. She tells me when it's that time of the month she will have craving for these kind of food. I can accept it but that time of the month can't possibly be everyday? She's snacking and drinking everyday while watching k drama. Then she will have craving to have korean instant noodles as supper at the same time.
She used to be dressier in the beginning and would deck out in colors that suit her but now she wears full on black everyday and it really doesn't sit well on my eyes. It's like she's ready to go to a funeral anytime. I'm a visual person and I also make effort to look good for her. I still go for regular haircuts and I still cycle and lift weights. I brush my teeth before I kiss her but she doesn't. She doesn't bother about her appearance anymore and I've not seen her exercise for months. I find myself getting increasingly frustrated at home while I'm with her.
I still love her but I find that she's very different from when we started to date. Is this how it's like living together? I haven't even talk about chores. There are some chores that she refuses to do and she said it's my place after all, so I'll have to be the one to do it. I think I'm covering 80% chores while she's only keen in doing 20%. She has the habit of leaving washed underwear in the toilet and I would have to be the one to take it out to hang because she would forget and ask me to do it instead. There's many other instances that she would forget to do something and I would be the one finishing the chore. I cannot imagine doing this long term.
When I try to talk about it she would get upset and binge snack and drink. I'm not even arguing with her. It's just talking in a calm tone.
Is that time of the month that bad that it becomes close to almost everyday? Or she's not what I think she is? How can I improve the situation?

Hi everyone, I would appreciate your thoughts on this small matter.
I was with my boyfriend at macs. When he came back to the table with the food, I troubled him to get a curry sauce, and he replied saying the staffs are busy. But still, he went over to the counter.
After close to 10 mins, he wasn’t back so I walked over and saw him waiting with other customers infront of the counter. He then went to the self-order machine, and wanted to order nuggets. I saw and I went forward and asked him why, and he said he wanted to buy to get the curry sauce.
Upon hearing that, I could feel myself boiling so I told him to go back first. There was a staff preparing orders at the counter so I went forward to ask and the staff passed me the curry sauce.
After I went back, we ate and admitted that we were unhappy about this. He felt that the staffs were busy and I still asked him to get the sauce. For me, I felt unhappy because I couldn’t understand why he wanted to buy extra nuggets to join the queue to get the curry sauce. Why couldn’t he just ask the staff at the counter? I know he didn’t want to trouble the staffs as they were busy, but I just felt angry at that moment.
I told him I’ll post here to get some thoughts, so feel free to comment and let me know what do you think of this small matter over a curry sauce, thanks.

THE CORNERS OF HIS HOUSE HAVE A LOT OF SPIDERS AND THEIR WOBWEBS AND I'M AFRAID OF SPIDERS AF. Like deathly afraid - will jump up, shriek, and run.

The last time I found one in my room and no one was around, I ran out of the house until my brother came back to kill it.
Where he is from and raised, he doesn't care about animals/insects and respects them - only killing them when truly necessary if they are pests (such as cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes). Other insects he will catch and release. He allows spiders to stay in the house as he believes they will keep mosquitoes and flies away by eating them.
So now I'm at a conundrum...he knows I'm afraid of spiders and has been trying to convince me that they are good but I can't...at the same time he won't clear the spiders as he says without them, there were a lot of mosquitoes...

59504,104875,"company refuses to acknowledge my resignation
hi guys, i need some advice regarding some work issues im facing. im currently interning in a singapore-based mnc and they continually refuse to process my resignation. what should i do?
context: i have been in this role for a little over a year, and i currently see no point in staying. at the start of the orientation, they promised us that we would have a good, meaningful experience and learn a lot during our time here. however, when orientation about the job actually begun, i saw what a lie that was. the direct superiors of the interns were power-hungry and aimed to take advantage of us, knowing that we were new. they overloaded us with tasks throughout the day and gaslighted us when we made the smallest mistakes, even when they were the ones at fault.
i switched departments and it wasnt any much of a difference. there was constant office politics, with people wanting to outdo each other no matter the cost to get a promotion. my superior even made us come in on saturdays to 'do what we were supposed to do' and meet his kpis. there wasnt any proper handover procedures in place, and we had to learn things from scratch as the employees who were leaving refused to contact the company again. as our department is facing manpower issues, we sometimes have to stay awake throughout the night for a few nights a week as well to do our tasks. to make things worse, the company is facing financial issues and isnt looking to increase our salaries, which is already below market pay. as im not learning much in this role anyway, and this industry doesnt align with my degree prospects, im looking to resign.
however, my superior and managing director of the division constantly refuses to acknowledge my resignation, saying im required to continue my internship 'by law' and 'its only two years'. ive talked to my MP before, but it doesnt help that my MP has connections with the company and was once managing director of another sister company, refusing to help out with my problem.
any advice on what i should do?

On the other hand, the cost of living and stress level even without a kid is insane. How to afford for the needs of a child and the commitment that comes.

59444,104778,"So around 6 months ago I met this guy in uni, let’s call him Z. He is the roomie of my groupmate in one of my modules. During last semester me and my bestie would always hang out at their room. At the start idk why but I just felt a spark, idk maybe he’s just my type, I just feel very happy when I’m with him.
Okay so here is the issue… I actually have a bf that is still in army that I met in poly. The thing with my bf is, he was the one who pursued me, at the start I already told him I don’t really like him, but he kept pursuing so in the end we got together. Actually everything so far with him is ok lah. He is very dependable, very nice actually, its just that sometimes I find him a bit too nice. Its like whenever we get into a fight, and actually it was my fault, but because I’m very stubborn, in the end he will still just come and apologise, even when he did nothing wrong lol. I just find him to be too nice already, until I feel its abit of a turnoff.
But for Z, he is the type of guy that is not scared to tease and talk cock with people (even girls), the type that can joke around one. Plus he is a very good texter, so I would usually text him some stuff about work or even like emotional stuff and he replies well, unlike my bf who is so dry in his replies (idk if this is considered emotional cheating?) But its not like I send anything explicit its just that I feel my bf doesn’t really understand me but Z can really relate. Its like whenever we meet, my bf will just go on a long rant about his army stuff that I have no idea wad he talking. But with Z, the stuff we talk about is like uni related.
But the problem is, at the start, Z told our groupmate that he is interested in my bestie. When I heard that I was damn sad, so I asked my bestie what she thought of Z, she say not her type. That was when I thought maybe got chance. But again the issue is, by right I’m not single, and idk if Z likes me or not.
Recently, I heard Z got quite close to another girl in a different clique, I overheard her name and went to his Instagram to stalk her. Wah, I see they go on walks together with his dog, almost like couple like that. But idk leh, whenever my groupmate tease Z if he got gf, Z will be dodgy about it, (so idk if they are actually together??)
There have been so many times where I wanted to confess to Z, but im so scared ppl will say im a h*e, got bf still look for guys etc. I mean my bf is really a nice guy, but he doesn't give me the thrill that Z gives.
Thinking back, if Z didn’t like my bestie in the first place, I would probably have broken up with my bf long ago. Then now maybe I won’t have this conflict…

I did not question him then, but when I researched myself, I found out that these people are like men's rights activists and are quite misogynistic.
I would consider myself a feminist, so I brought up his YouTube history with him, and he says he just watches it ""for fun"". Idk if this is true, or will he abuse me or something in the future. So far, he has never been physical with me and has been quite nice. We do have occasional arguments, but he would apologise later.
But I do notice lately that he has been less gentlemanly compared to when we first started dating. Like previously he would always pay for our dates, and sometimes I would offer to split, but he never would let me pay. But nowadays, often he actually accepts when I offered to pay half. I mean, I know I shouldn't expect him to pay for all our dates, but I just felt disappointed how he treated me so well before, but he changed after getting comfortable with me. I feel like those videos are making him less gentlemanly.

59579,105038,"Seen a couple of posts in this page talking about boyfriends having close female friends. But still posting this in attempt to clear my mind and hopefully get some good advice.
My bf of 1 yr+ has a close female friend from uni days, B. My bf said they only meet once every few months and don’t communicate often other than to arrange meetups. He did tell me whenever he meets B, but never asked me to tag along or intro me to her before. At first, I never questioned their relationship and trusted my bf that it’s purely platonic. I thought since B seems happily married for few years already, unlikely anything will happen.
However, recently my gut feeling tells me something’s sus about them. A few things that happened:
- These days, almost every time we meet, I catch my bf texting B. She’ll tell him little things like what she eats, her travel plans, ask for his opinion on house purchase (my bf is not in real estate industry btw) etc. And he replies her immediately even while he is tgt with me eating / watching shows. Whereas he usually takes hours to reply my texts.
- For my bf’s bday this year, B bought him a lavish gift and she even drove over to his house to pass him the gift and bday cake at midnight. Isn’t that too much for a normal guy friend that you got no feelings for?
- My bf is damn lazy to dress up but he will put in effort to look nice for B. Once I went out with him before he met B, and he purposely went home early to change before meeting her. He said it’s because the place they’re dining at has smart casual dress code. He never even brought me to such places before!
- Once I was unwell and alone at home on a Sat night and asked him to come over, but he went ahead to meet B for dinner instead, saying he felt bad to cancel. Before the dinner, we talked on the phone and had a little argument about priorities. He got angry and asked me why must I be so unhappy with him meeting B on a Sat night, when B’s husband is perfectly fine about it? Which is totally out of point. He didn’t even ask me how I’d settle my meal or how I was feeling. In fact he ghosted me from the time they met until late afternoon the next day. I was so upset and hurt.
I want to know if these things my bf and B did are normal, or should I really be worried about these two? Wild thoughts are running in my head right now, thinking what if they used to hook up in the past. Or could he have chased her in the past but got friendzoned, and now both catching feelings again…..
Also need advice on how to communicate my insecurity to my bf without sounding unreasonable and making him turn defensive.

I am the kind of guy who doesn’t enjoy kisses and hugs/cuddles. I thought kisses are kind of pointless and hugs/cuddles are not really practical in SG because of the hot weather.

But my gf is the kind who is really touchy and likes kisses and hugs/cuddles alot. Even after doing the deed, she will want to cuddle to sleep. I think it’s really uncomfortable to stick together physically like that, plus my arm gets numb with her sleeping on it.

59480,104843,"Just wanted to share my experience with my mother-in-law, because I feel like I need to write this out before I finally close this chapter. Super long, but I hope my story entertains someone at least...
Bluntly speaking, I hate my mother-in-law. I've been married 2 years and it's not gotten better. For context, my husband is Chinese Singaporean and I'm not (my exact race is irrelevant). We dated for a few years before he proposed and all those years, not once did she show me any unkindness. After getting married, while waiting for our BTO, we moved in with her first (supposed to be for just 10 months, and we only lasted 2 weeks).
She'd wake me up at 8am for no reason at all, except ""Daughter in law should be awake before parents in law. No need do anything, just be awake."" Meanwhile, my husband would sleep in. She bought me my own hamper because she said ""*my race* needs to be separated from her family -- who are all Chinese"". Whenever I'd eat food, she'd take photo and send my mom, and say ""This isn't a Chinese diet. No wonder she's getting fat"". And many other stories. So, 1 week in, we started quietly looking for a room to rent. When she found out, she said really crude things like... I was stealing her son away / I must've fed him nasi kang kang to brainwash him, etc. Then she texted my parents, ""I regret letting your daughter marry my son.""
That day itself, we moved back with my family instead -- slept on my parents' couch for 2 weeks until we found a place to move in to. My MIL continued sending harassment messages. Like, would tell my husband ""I'll beat her up when you're not at home."" It was too much.
I've kept myself generally low contact. I can't bear to call her, Mom, and after all the insults she's hurled at me - These take the cake:
1. For Guo Da Li and Si Dian Jing, she said I didn't need to receive it because I'm not Chinese anyway. But whenever she asks for things, she said I must give it because I'm marrying Chinese now.
2. I asked her, why she was so kind all the years I was a girlfriend. She said, even if I was his girlfriend for YEARS, it would be okay. But marriage means I must become Chinese. The man must always be followed.
3. She visited us once and I was scrubbing the toilet floor while my husband was wiping the fridge (chores day), then she scolded me for making her poor son clean. WTF.
4. My family paid for the wedding and she got more than half of the tables - she said my family providing for me is the reason I'm so spoiled, and dont know how to spoil her son instead. During the wedding, my parents, my father in law, all went around taking photos and stuff. She refused to greet people because she had no escort -- her wedding or what?? People commented about her, and our wedding photos has pics of her frowning, looking sleepy, playing phone games... and she says we never give her face??
5. But finally... last night, my grandfather (who was visiting us) had a seizure. My husband updated his parents, and instead of sympathy she told me to ""throw"" my grandparents back to my mom instead. I told her she had no sympathy, and she said ""So what?"". I've decided to cut her off. I blocked her on social media and messaging apps.
She's been calling my husband non-stop and insulting me, my upbringing, and is telling him, she regrets giving birth to him, and if he doesn't go back to her soon, she will jump off their HDB flat.
There's so many more things but I can't type them all. I'm tired. Is it wrong if I just genuinely dont care? I dont know how much disrespect I have to take.

Context: My bf (26M) and I are busy with work during the weekdays and we meet only during the weekends. But, we do spend some time at night together like watching series on netflix party but not everyday.
Here’s the problem. Whenever we decided to watch drama or movie, he will take his time to bathe, play his phone games, sometimes even nap. Because of that, we can watch maximum 1 episode or a movie and we will head to sleep cause he say tired, next day he needs to work.
But, when it comes to playing computer games with his friend (girl), he can rush to eat, bathe and play until midnight even though there is work the following day.
He is also to a certain inflexible…? For example, there was once I texted him to do a certain activity with me but his friend (girl) texted him 5 mins earlier to play game. It’s not like he replied her then I ask. He saw both our messages at the same time and told me he’ll play with his friend since she asked first. At that point, I just wish he would prioritize me. To be honest, I feel jealous and I feel that I weigh lesser to him. I want to voice it to him about this but I feel that he will view me as a crazy girlfriend because there was once their friend said she is one of the “boys” and she got a bf too - when his friend’s gf voiced out that she is jealous.
Not sure if my feelings are valid or I’m the crazy girlfriend?
Is there any advice on how not to feel this way or how should I open this topic to my bf without him feeling like I’m the crazy girlfriend…

59522,104901,"My ex and I have been broken up for a few years now and I've already moved on from it. My relationship with my ex was a pretty toxic one; she was an insecure and pathological liar and when i broke it off, she would tell me that I'll never find an honest partner. We continued to fight even after the break up but by the end of it, we settled it calmly and wished each other the best. We haven't spoken since.
Fast forward to now, I'm currently in a strong and healthy relationship with the love of my life. But sometimes, I feel like messaging my ex to catch up on life. To see where she is at now and on some level, I would like to show off to her that she was wrong. But I don't do it because I don't want to hurt my partner or to have her think that I'm cheating. I feel bad for even wanting to catch up with an ex, even though I know full well that I have no lingering romantic or sexual attraction to my ex.
Is it a bad sign if I want to catch up with an ex? Or is it bad to want to catch up?

59586,105045,"I am interning at a certain popular e commerce company. I will be here until the end of the year, and it is quite dreadful everyday. It is not that my superiors are nasty. They are friendly and teach me stuff. However because most of the employees are not Singaporean, the work culture is quite different, even the way they treat Singaporeans is also different. They only care about their fellow countrymen, so if the team consists of people from different backgrounds, the team will not be bonded. It is quite obvious that they are only friendly with each other for work relations.
Recently a new full timer joined my team. He is also from that country. As such, he is treated extremely well. He was given a tour around the office and they even treated him lunch. Back when I joined, there was no such treatment lol. But I guess it is because I am a temporary staff there is no need to treat me that well. I am fine with that.
However, my supervisor has been assigning work that was meant for me, to him. Hence ever since he joined my workload has become significantly less and I don't learn as much anymore. I am also kept out of the loop for projects that I used to be part of, and he has replaced me. My supervisor even asked me to give him my script which I spent 1 entire month working on, so that he can take over my duties. Now I dread going to work because I want to be busy and learn things but now I cannot because everything has been passed to this new guy. Maybe my supervisor finds it easier to communicate with someone of similar background as her, so she stopped giving me important tasks and instead gave them to him.
It has come to the point where every day I have to ask for work because I have nothing to do. But the work assigned to me is extremely mundane. I miss the days before this new full timer joined. I really don't know how I am going to handle the next few months in this team.

59564,104999,"no matter what i do for my gf, her family n friends has never approved of me.
Since we started to date, she felt that her life quality as dropped. She said she given up a lot of things for me and she been feeling quite mentally exhausted. She been wanting me to proposal to her and getting our marriage but i feel that currently, we're not ready yet. We've also been quarrelling for even small matters, she always think that she's in the right and i've been purposely finding faults to argue with her.
She always get angry for no reasons. That day her mum asked me to help her buy stuffs and since she said she tired from sch, so i picked her up and send her home first. But she get angry that i didn't told her that her mum asked me to help buy items and she felt that buying those stuffs unnecessary. She argue with me said that i don't bother telling her what's happening and then she throw mine items on the floor, take scissors cut the shirts that i owned. While picking those items she thrown on the floor, she been raising her voice until whole building could heard the arguments.
Sometimes she love to play ""cold wars"" with me for no reasons, suddenly block me for hours/days then don't want pick up any calls/messages. She allergies to crabs so when we eating, she insist of eating crabs but i said no. She angry and then walked/dump me there while we're dinning.
She also angry that i don't share salted eggs potato chips with her when i ordered like a bulk of it and she probably ate like 90% of it and i eat probably like half a packet. Saying how "" I don't love her anymore, don't cherish her anymore after we're dating"". She said how in her family, what she wants to eat n etc, ppl will always ask her, share with her and they don't snatch with her snacks to eat.
So one of the days, i requested her to walks the dog as i was busy with presentation and since for the past few days, it was raining so the dog didn't manage to be out of the house. She said i'm treating her like a maid, asking her to follow my order. She never touched dirty things in her life. for example, when the dog shits. i'm always the one picking up the poops. In her family, she ate alr just dump the plate/bowl at the sink/basin, for someone in her family to wash. She also don't tidy up her room, sweep floors and etc, was always me when i go her house to help her housekeeping her room.
She also have a bad habits of wasting money on unnecessary. She always like to go cinema to watch movies , probably like every week. But i'm the one paying for it since she doesn't have any income. She also rant that i am unlike other ppl bf, buy for their gf accessories.

59554,104980,"Is it really too much to refuse to date guys who still live at home with their parents?
I get that it's normal here for people to live at home well into their adult life, but it's just not for me.
I get so many excuses like:
""Housing is expensive and no one can afford to buy a home / waiting to BTO"" Okay? People can rent. I rent. Nearly all of my friends rent. It's doable. I'm not saying people have to buy a house.
""It's normal for guys to live at home so you just have to accept it"" Why do I need to accept it? I don't. I can just do what I'm doing now and refuse to date guys who still live at home.
""Why don't you just go to a hotel room then?"" Because I don't want to feel like a call girl or that I'm sneaking around behind their parent's back.
""My parents are fine with me bringing girls over"" Good for them, but I'm not going to do anything when their parents are RIGHT THERE IN THE SAME HOUSE. It's wildly uncomfortable.
The worst are the people who call me a gold digger, because to them the only people who can move out are the super rich (not true) and the people who somehow twisted this into a race thing. In their mind the vast majority of guys who don't live at home are foreigners, so my standard means I'm a self-hating racist because it means I'll be rejecting all the local guys and mostly dating foreign guys.
To me it's got nothing to do with money, and nothing to do with race. It's a sign of independence. My experiences of dating guys who still live at home isn't good. I've had guys try to sneak me into a completely dark house because it's 2am and of course their parents are asleep. Guys who had to update their parents on their whereabouts, report when they leave, if they're going to get back late. Guys who still let their parents/maid feed them, do their laundry, do their dishes, do all the house chores. Guys who tried to change a date location because their parents didn't think it was a good idea. Ever since I've started only dating guys who've moved out, I don't run into issues like hthat anymore.
There's not quite any replacement for living alone. I want to date a guy that's used to living alone and handling all the things that come with it. Someone who's completely cut the apron strings.
I don't think that's a high standard at all, so I'm tired of getting so much shit for it

59477,104837,"I f up and snooped on my partners phone but hear me out.
My gf has always portrayed herself as someone innocent, those girls you'd imagine who never had s*x (I have never either) and we've never really engaged in dirty talks much because of religion. I came across one of her chat with her girl BFF and saw some texts that shocked me. Her being someone who keeps secrets would never tell me, but I went further to snoop on her phone (I messed up big time and I take responsibility for my actions).
Upon snooping I found her she has been talking dirty with this girl BFF over a guy she dated back in 2019 and she was saying stuff like ""we study diff stuff. We study on the bed "",""I'm wet downstairs, xxx loves to lick my below"".
It has changed my whole perspective of her and I see her in a different light. I can't help but think - has she actually done anything with these guys all along when she said she haven't? How do I confront her about it? I don't want to be lied to in a rs and had she been upfront about her body count (if any), I would have been fine. I am feeling so shitty now but I know whatever answer she gives me it will not satisfy me anymore.

59567,105005,"Is it really that inconceivable for a man to want to be single for the rest of his life?
I have never dated. But the idea of my having to live a life to please another human being who doesn’t at the bare minimum pay me makes absolutely no sense to me.
I make a good living. I’m an Oxbridge-trained lawyer who is on track to becoming one of the youngest junior partners of my law firm’s history. I love my job. It’s highly interesting and I go to bed looking forward to the next day of work. I can’t say the same about the prospect of having another woman live in my condo. It fills me with dread to have to share my space with someone.
My older brother is a junior partner at a different law firm and his wife has just been a pain in his ass since they met. Doesn’t work, the maid looks after the kids, and she just buys ridiculously expensive stuff all the time. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him happy since he was married.
Since you get one try to be married to a person. Why would anyone nowadays take that gamble?

I don’t even want to go to school. To add this on, Her family is asking me to move on from her but I can’t do it. The reason is because they do not want my marital status to be widowed after their daughter pass on.

59485,104842,"I feel really sad. I am the only one who’s in this situation, nobody has it worse than me?
I still haven’t been invited to any wedding yet. No, I didn’t say I have no friends. But friend 1 had a small ROM with only parents from both sides, friend 2 had an ROM with only her and her husband, friend 3 had an online wedding due to covid, friend 4 is still single and actively looking, friend 5 is happily single and not looking to settle down, friend 6 was JUST ABOUT to invite all of us to her wedding when her boyfriend broke up with her and everything was cancelled again…….
Friend 6 adamantly refuses to date, friend 7 is still dating and her boyfriend hasn’t popped the question yet, and friend 8 is constantly in and out of casual relationships.
My university friend invited only her jc classmates. My work friend invited only her secondary school friends. My jc friend migrated overseas and could not invite any of us in Singapore.
Look, I didn’t say “everyone in the clique/class/cca is invited and I’m the only one left out.” Nothing like this happened, it’s just I have seen so many acquaintances get to attend weddings, take photos, and even participate in fun bridesmaid duties and wear matching dresses, except me. I still haven’t been to any one.
What should I do about my situation? I realised that even these same friends who don’t throw wedding banquets have weddings to attend every month, because THEIR OTHER FRIENDS HAVE BIG WEDDINGS.

59550,104974,"to the OP of #104926
so hey guess who read your post? thats right its your skinny bf. sorry for the fact that im not hunky like other guys put there but as you know i have to juggle between school and work, then there’s you, so there is hardly any time to work out.
i can’t believe that after all the things i did for you, you’d have the audacity to even consider hooking up with one of your hall mates regardless whether you did or didn’t. i work my ass off after school to pay for our dates, buy your designer apparels and bags to the point i only eat two meals a day, which consists of either bread or a simple rice with vegetables, and this is what i get in return.
i scrimp and save just so i can provide you with the things you desire, to the point i can’t help but get a tad bit envious when i walk by Starbucks only to catch a glimpse my friends enjoying their cold brew when all i can afford is a cup of kopi-c. i have never complained or showed you how tired and stressed out i am over this because i really love you and want the best for you, then again, you had thoughts of cheating.
it irks me when i realised im dating someone who i eventually plan to marry develop such obscene thoughts towards other men so i have decided to initiate a break up after leaving this message here. congrats on being free and good luck with those men who are only after your body Agnes L**, tbh you aren’t that good looking yourself lmfao so no idea where u got that self confidence from haha.

However, he doesn’t really have a attractive body (a bit fat on his tummy and small d) and I find it to be quite a turn off.

My bf and I have been tgt for 2 years. He is currently a regular in the army and he frequently goes overseas for 1-2 mths for operations. Last year end, I discovered his insta account password and logged in into it. Everyday, I would enter to see the accounts he has searched, his DMs on his account and also view his friends’ profile. Sometimes, I see that he searched for accounts of girls (influencers) on his insta, usually those girls who are wearing very revealing. I do feel a bit uncomfortable about this, but understand that guys like to see these stuff. Also, he is treating me well, always updating me on his whereabouts and making time to text me although he is overseas. Recently, he changed his password and I have been logged out of his account and cannot enter it again. I am now feeling insecure, because I cannot track his activities on insta while he is currently overseas on another operation. I have crazy thoughts that what if he hooks up with other girls while he is overseas, text other girls online etc. I feel irritated with myself for being insecure just because I cannot trace his social media activity now.

59433,104756,"Dear XY,
When we first met, I was looking for your boss and you took the initiative to stand up from your desk and told me he wasn’t around. At that time, I found you cute looking. After that first encounter, you emailed me after you got to know I was your business partner and we started chatting more via email until you asked me out for lunch one day.
Our interactions increased ever since. It all came to end, or so I thought, when I found out from other coworkers you were engaged. It devastated me and I vowed to reduce interactions with you. You were persistent and kept messaging me when you felt I was withdrawing. So I thought no harm having you as a friend. Boy, was I wrong. We met a few times after that. During one of the meet ups, I remembered we went to a live singing bar. It was then we first held hands, hugged and kissed.
I knew it was wrong but I couldn’t pull away. I was praying that you would break your engagement with your partner. I was so naive back then and I totally disregarded the fact that you seldom replied me during weekends. You even said during one of the meetups that if I still looked as youthful in 5 years time, you would marry me. I was elated and thought there was hope. Our physical interactions were still going on but thankfully we didn’t go full base.
The bombshell came when you invited me to your wedding. It was then it all came crashing down on me that I had been letting you lead me on telling me that it wasn’t a bad thing being a secret third party and I did consider. Well, the mist cleared and I was back to my logical self. I told you I did not want a person who was unavailable when I needed him/her the most.
It took a lot of willpower to walk away and I will be the first to admit that I stumbled a few times before I completely cut off contact with you. Now I have a partner who is available for me 24/7 and stayed with me when I needed him/her the most.
Despite all this, I still wish that you would reach out to me now and we can rekindle the spark. No strings attached because I do not wish to jeopardize my current life.
If you are reading this, I hope you remember there was once this youthful looking girl who looked like she was fresh out of school looking for your boss to sign documents.

59570,105013,"My partner is too nice. He is nice to me and also to everyone around him. He is someone that is easily convinced by anyone and easy to be taken advantage of. So at his workplace, coworkers especially female coworkers like to approach him for help and they like to make small requests like helping them to run errands, takeaway breakfast for them, driving them out for lunch when there are eating places at walkable distance and sometimes dropping them home since it is along the way etc.
I don’t want to be the bad person and ask him to stop helping people. As his girlfriend, my concern here is that he can’t say no and his female coworkers are taking advantage of that. Anyone can influence his opinions. I have tried talking through this with him and usually his reply will be like ""I don't see any issue in this"" and says that’s who he is. We will end up in small arguments because of this.
Due to these small arguments, he chose to ""help"" them out ""behind my back"" instead e.g. bringing them out for lunch or fetching them home and this makes me more annoyed because he don't get my point. I know that he is trying to save some petrol money too so we are meeting up lesser so that he can ""save"" up on his petrol money. Yet, he won't hesitate to bring his female coworkers out for lunch when they requested for it or he will drop them off to their houses directly after work dinner. All these requests are happening on a very frequent basis. He mentioned that he don't want to let me know because he wants to avoid these ""stupid"" arguments.
Also, I don't feel like he prioritizes me more than them. Make it clear first that I don't want him to stop being friends with them. I feel like being his girlfriend just being another one of his coworkers/friends because seems like whatever he is doing for his female coworkers are the same as towards me.
So is it wrong for me to feel annoyed? And to all the females, can you accept your partner being such a pushover/people-pleaser and also often putting his females coworkers/friends' needs first?
