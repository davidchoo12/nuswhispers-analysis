61173,108334,"Just recently, I had a chat with 2 of my part time working friends while we were studying in uni.
It is really sad that we share the same struggle. Let’s call girl A and another girl B.
Girl A has to pay off her father house loan for another 30 years as her father had refinanced the house under her name just to pay off gambling debts. 
Father doesn’t work and her mother resigned from work to take care of girl A’s daughter. 
Worse of all, she is going through divorce as her husband has been absent since she gave birth. The daughter is now 3years old and he has never visited their daughter more than 10 times.
Girl B, she is paying off her parents debt due to their failed business + gambling. Monthly around 3k which is shared with her brother. Her parents don’t work so she has to pay for all expenses such as house rental, utilities and food alone. 
For me, my mum likes to play 4D, our family has been paying off her debt because she went and borrow money from outsider.  My father used to gamble but he quit long time ago. We have been nagging at her to stop borrowing money from outsider as the interest will be super high and you don’t know who u’re messing with. You might get ur family member in trouble! Bt she never listens. I am tired of talking to her and nagging the same thing over.
I feel like this generation, the kids especially, are paying off the debts for your parents. I’m grateful for them to raise us up and giving us foods under a roof. But do they really think that we are their retirement package? I do feel bad when I think like this. I can give them money for food and necessities, but not for gambling. 
This is what really saddens me. 
No wonder nowadays the population is getting lesser. Please don’t reproduce and treat your kids like ATM or retirement package.

61176,108339,"Another thing to mention about IQ is the fact that the top IP/IB schools have IQ averages around 120 (if you use top British and American schools as an analog bearing in mind that our students regularly outperform their American and British counterparts). Pick out any student from Hwa Chong or RI and they'd likely be in the very top percentile of natural intellectual giftedness. I went to both Hwa Chong and RI and my experience is people are very smart across the board. What manifests as differences in academic performance in these schools are due to things not related to genetics. By my observation it is mostly work ethic.
There was several students in my graduating cohort at RJC who did poorly for A-levels who went on to become absolute beasts in their college years, two of whom are now pursuing PhDs at Stanford and Columbia. The boy who is at Stanford got three Cs at A-levels and I know him to be one of the biggest slackers. When I last meet him he was a changed person. Cerebral almost.
Why do I mention only the top schools? Assuming the top 10% of high schooler leavers in Singapore goes to any of SMU/NUS/SUTD/NTU, it is likely that students are more genetically similar than different. Possibly the reason there are people who do well in CS vs people who don't do well in CS is more due to a wrong selection of course. i.e People who are not doing well in CS perhaps would have been FCH in another course but they pick CS despite not having much talent. In Hwa Chong students are taught computing since sec 1. There is no excuse, particularly for those from my alma mater, not to have known that they do not have a talent for CS.
Here's another anecdote. I know a friend who was in accounting. He had a terrible time with it. He found it extraordinarily difficult for whatever reason. Midway through his second year he switched to CS at a top engineering school in Pittsburgh. He graduated with a 4.0. He now works at a hedge fund in New York.
To the students of NUS who are not doing well:
1. You probably need to fix your work ethic.
2. You probably need to be in a different course.
3. You are probably not so much stupider than the top student in your course, you just need to use your brain in a different field.
I was a middling computing student who turned out to be one of the most sought after programmers in Silicon Valley. My salary reflects this. Work is also quite different to school. I don't know if people would agree. I also don't know if all of Ben's top students are doing amazingly but I certainly am an outlier. I was his student and he'd probably think I wouldn't get far in life given how badly I did in his class.

61170,108329,"AITA (TLDR): Some background first, I am the younger of 2 boys (4 yrs gap) in a family. When growing up, I was always the 'fav' child due to my traditional parents' thinking of 'rewarding when good, punishing when bad' mentality. My results had always been better than my bro as I am those who is goal oriented. In case u r thinking is academic results goal, no but watching cartoons goal coz my mum won't let me watch TV if I dun meet her demands. So I was one of those who finished the assessment books in half a year type during Pri Sch. 
My bro, on the other hand, got into trouble since Sec 3. He was involved in gangs and thefts and was even caught in a departmental store before. So my bro was not happy with me since young as I got things I wanted. 
Life in Pri Sch was quick for me but one incident stayed with me. One day, while I was at home, my dad came home early from work and hid in the room. I was instructed to lie to say he wasn't at home. True enough, loan sharks came and I did what I did. This incident stuck with me ever since. 
Life continued and I went through the JC-Uni route, and got a scholarship to pay for my fees with allowances while my bro dropped out of school in Sec sch. My mum was really the happy one as she told me they didn't have enough for my fees anyway. Then in Uni, during my year 3 final exams, I got a call from my bro, telling me my dad had a woman outside. He asked me who I would go with, and my answer was my mum. This was the second major incident. 
After exams when I went home (I stayed in hostel), my dad had a long chat with me. He came up with some story that the woman was giving him money to meet his financial troubles and was disappointed I chose my mum over him as he felt he loved me sufficiently to forgive such a thing. At that moment, I felt the irony as they had been very fair since young. While my bro got into trouble, they helped him to learn a skill and get a job but didn't give him too much (or rather they could not afford to I guess). 
Fast forward, both my bro and I got our own family, each with 2 boys, and our own place. My parents had a 3-rm flat and had been renting out for a long time. My parents would stay at my bro's place on Sun night to Thu night, and come over to mine for the weekend as my bro didn't want to send his kids to infant care. My relationship with my bro is also normal, but fantastically close and on talking terms. On the other hand, my bro had never had a healthy relationship with my dad since the second incident. 
My mum suddenly passed away after being diagnosed of cancer a few years ago. Since then, my dad had lived off the rental, his own salary (combined to be about $4k/mth), and savings left over by my mum. He told me the amount left was about $40k. Less than 3 mths after my mum passed, my dad moved to my place citing difficulties living with my brother. It was during this time, he told me he had a PRC 'girlfriend' of 6 yrs (which means before my mum's death). 
He also started telling me he dun want to leave the HDB to my bro and wanted to 'will' it to me. It didn't feel right to me so I told him not to do so as I felt the HDB also included my mum's share which she would leave it fairly to both of us. Then one day, he came home with a letter from a lawyer citing that he found a loophole and had left an instruction to pass the decision-making on what to do with the HDB and the money to me (whatever that is). It didn't bother me as I was sure I will pass half to my bro. Some months passed, and he asked me for a loan of a few grand coz he owed my uncle about $30k. I passed the money to him. 
A couple of weeks later, he asked me for money as his girlfriend was leaving SG for good and he wanted to give her money for the years of companionship. You can imagine my answer. How would I give money to you to pass to a woman who is not my mum? 
Then the ridiculous event happened, about 2-3 mths later, he came home, said he needed to talk me something serious, and I guessed it, he sold the HDB. He cited that he owed my uncle close $xxx,xxx, and he got no choice. After calculations by him, he would left about $100k cash. 
It was at this moment when I put all the bs he was pulling together. But I didn't bother to expose him. A few days passed, so I decided to do a 'test'. He asked him for the same uncle's number and meet him as I had a friend who needed some contacts in China. My uncle used to run some importing from China for his shop and some of his business friends regularly. So my dad gave me some excuses that he would ask my uncle for permission first. So basically the 'test' failed. But again I didn't bother to expose him. 2 days later, he saw me at home and said he could help me pass the message and maybe get the China contact for me etc. 
This was when I could not take it anyway. I told him off straight away. I told him that from the many stories he told me, it wasn't hard to guess which is true, which is bs. All these while, he was trying to get me to give him money to that girlfriend and suddenly debt with my Uncle ballooned to 6 figures. He dare not let me meet my Uncle in person as I was trained in micro expressions and I could tell if someone was lying through questions and observing the behaviours. I also gave him a piece of my mind about how he used to compare himself with some relatives of ours on how good he was, but he is turning into them, or worse. I left the house and after that, he moved back to my bro's place. 
My bro called me and we started sharing the different stories of what he told both sides. Then apparently, my mum left more than $100k for him, not the $40k he claimed. It was about 2.5 yrs, and I did a calculation. To finish all the money he had within 2.5 yrs, he had to spend about $7k or more a month. That was crazy amount to me as I dun spend $7k for my family of 4. My bro also revealed another incident. He was found with another woman (which almost ended in a divorce too) when I was much younger in my lower pri, but my mum instructed my bro to keep it from me. 
My dad had basically cut all contacts with me, and my bro and I are not talking to him much. We only see one another when we are praying to my mum. 
AITA here?

61171,108332,"I stumbled onto this page few months ago and I'm disturbed about the recent discussion on EE and Engineering. They are being treated as a dumping ground today compared to courses like CS.
I'm an EE alumni. I graduated a long time ago, 33 years ago to be exact which is easily more than most of your have been alive.  I'm your old senior.
I would like to share my observations and advice to my EE juniors reading this who may have jealous thoughts of their CS friends.
In my time, Engineering especially Electrical Engineering were prestigious courses. CS was the dumping ground. CS undergrads were usually those who failed to enter EE or those who could not handle the rigor of the EE curriculum and thus had to drop to an easier degree. 
Let me quantify this factually, EE graduates are usually acceptable for software roles as proved by most job advertisements. The converse is not true, you will never find any CS graduate in roles like electronics, PCB layout, ASIC, RF, optics, high-power systems etc because they are simply not qualified for them. Given the versatility of jobs EE graduates can do compared to CS, it is obvious which is the objectively more superior degree. One can learn CS on your own but picking up EE skills by yourself is impossible.
CS being the dominant course today is a temporary aberration. 
EE and Engineering will never disappear because it is the foundation of the modern world. In my decades in the Engineering industry, an Engineering career is actually the most stable compared to software which I observed goes through more rapid boom and bust cycles.
My advice to you all is that EE while a hard and multi-disciplinary course but it is for your own good. Stick it out to graduation and the whole world awaits you. Hardware jobs, software jobs, you have the flexibility to do anything compared to your CS friends. 
Versatility, domain knowledge and generalist skills are highly sought after in the future job market. Coding which CS grads mostly do will soon be rendered increasingly obsolete with AI tools like ChatGPT and commoditization and accessibility of programming skills.

61175,108338,"Following your interests (conditional on it being a reasonably remunerated profession) is not how you become poor, it's how you avoid becoming poorer. I think too often we focus all our time and energy trying to figure out which industry (or major) pays the most while we spend almost no time trying to figure out what we're good at *and* interested in. There are a lot of ways to make money, but you don't do it by being mediocre. I see a lot of people going into investment banking, management consulting, software engineering, law, medicine, despite not having much interest in these professions beforehand. I have also seen people who are hyper-focused at what they really liked doing and made more money than top lawyers or doctors. My cousin is an example. Growing up he was obsessed with MS Paint. Yes, Microsoft Paint. The stuff he used to draw with a mouse was superior to anything I could have ever drawn by hand. Nobody thought he would make anything of this hobby. He did an arts degree eventually and we all thought he would be homeless. My parents certainly did. Today he runs a digital marketing company that does everything from websites to video commercials. He has more than 50 people working for him and he makes more money in a month than I can make in a year as a lawyer. I studied law and I'm not even a lawyer now because I only did law because my mom forced me to. I do consulting which I also hate.
I'm not jealous or anything (well I am a little but also proud of him) but just thought I should share some life lessons.

61174,108337,"Hi Prof. Ben
I am a mechanical engineer who has worked for 6 years, across the semiconductor & medical industries. I am considering switching career into the Artificial Intelligence sector. However, there are not many career conversion + job placement opportunities out there and they are highly competitive.
There's also another option for me to pay 4k+ USD to attend a 8 month program by the School of computing. But, even if I get into this course and acquire some A.I knowledge, I doubt there will be much ways for me to put what I have learnt into actual practice. A cert is as good as a toilet paper without actual industry experience. This places me in a huge dilemma.
Please kindly enlighten me and show me the way out.
I do not want to be left out for the next technological revolution. I am willing to run, not walk!

61172,108333,"Dear love, a few months after I started work in this company, I started to have feelings for you and the feelings grow as time goes by. You were everything, if not more, than what I would ever ask for in a partner. To me, you are a ""one in a million"" -- it's the simple gestures like saying ""thank you"", or being a gentleman most of the time is what I really love about you.  I value little gestures; it's the thought that counts. You made realize that a person with a good EQ doesn't have to be a bullshitter. You are wise with your words, and the way you say things. However, not long after, a trusted and reliable source told me that you had never wanted a relationship with me and that we were just colleagues. I was heartbroken. It was my first actual heartbreak and you had taught me what a heartbreak feels like. I couldn't come to terms with why you didn't want to be with me. I told myself that maybe you had inadvertently led me on.
I understand that a handful of those around us realize that there is something between us. When being asked whether I am aware of your relationship status ie, whether you are single, or attached, I quickly brush it off and say ""he is such a good guy I am sure he is attached"" but deep in my heart I know that the statement is an immature one. I value you in the team. I realize that I look up to you, amongst other things. 
As time goes by, I realize I still love you, albeit not as much as I used to after what the source said. However, a few days back I had a dream that I had known you from my past life; I know your race, your gender (you were a female then) and that we were close friends. You are my soulmate, but why can't we be together? Why don't you love me? That might explain why I love your aura, your energy, and why I felt a kind of connection with you. The thought of ""us"" lingers in my mind after the dream. When I saw you walking past my desk it felt nice to have the upper hand of knowing who you were in your past life and that we had known each then. Now, we are two different individuals and I feel that we have probably reached a point of no return -- notwithstanding the fact that you might or might not be attached, you believe that I am attached and my partner is a caucasian. Has it ever come to your mind that he is my father? I studied in the UK since high school and you are aware of that. When my job was on the rocks, I was upset and I wanted to make my desk more ""homely"". So, I decorated my workspace with pictures of home ie. my family members. I have a Chinese surname, am not a local, and my surname follows that of my mother. My dad is a Caucasian and spent most of his time in the UK. I honestly feel that we have reached a point of no return. Even though the person said you never wanted to have a relationship with me, I had a gut feeling that you hated the picture of my father. 
I feel that we have reached a point of no return. Ie. that you thought I was attached and you/we have given up on each other.  On my end, the deal breaker was what the source (a tarot reader) had said, and to you (if you ever had feelings for me), it's probably the fact that you had thought I was attached. As a result, you were less friendly than you were before. Understand that if I were to approach you and clear things up, you would (like all humans do) protect yourself/ act cool/ or not understand a thing I was saying. If I were to approach you and tell you that I had a dream that you were my soulmate, I might be a ""weirdo"" to you, and that might keep us further apart. Tbh, I feel we were closer then, during the first few months in the company.  I can't put myself in a difficult position of letting you know that you are my soulmate.
I love you, but I can't put myself in a position to let you know how I feel. I am grateful to know that I had known you in my previous life; we were friends then, and I hope I am a friend to you, in this life. I don't know when you will forget about me as humans do when we grow older or lose touch, but if that is the case, I hope to meet you again in our next life cycle.
