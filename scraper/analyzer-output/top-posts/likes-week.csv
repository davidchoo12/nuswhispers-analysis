60497,106903,"I'm a foreign masters student in NUS for a year. Something that has been bugging me for some time. Part of the reason I came to Singapore for my postgrad is hopefully to make some Singaporean friends. However there seems to be very few Singaporeans who take master degrees. Most of my classmates are in fact from China.
May I know why?

60498,106908,"TL;DR Became a doctor for the wrong reasons, feeling disillusioned
I used to do relatively well in school, so when the time came to choose a course, medicine was a natural decision for me. Natural not because of some gravitation towards helping people or other noble desires, but rather it was more of just a question of studying the best course available to me at the time. I guess it was partly ambition. With many friends and family members scrutinising my every achievement, I needed to show that I could do it, I could make it, I could be somebody and have a nice title to prove it.
As I progressed in my studies, it became increasingly apparent that many aspects of the field just did not appeal to me. Often I just faked interest to blend in but did the bare minimum in the things I hated just to get it over with. I found myself repeatedly questioning myself about my decision to go into medicine, if I'm really cut out for this etc. (Though after speaking to some close doctor friends, I realised I wasn't the only one who harboured such thoughts.) Nevertheless, I pulled through with my studies because I had already sacrificed too much to consider changing courses.
Now here I am, a clinician who hates clinical practice, who loathes having to stick things up people's butts and pretend it's normal, who dislikes doing any kind of procedure on a patient actually. It's not that I don't care about them - I do want someone to help them, I just don't want to be the one doing it. Some patients are nice and I can suppress my dislike a little bit better, but when a patient is rude or demanding, I would have no qualms about telling them to f*k right off. (Not in those words exactly, but just enough to not be held accountable for it) I mean there are plus sides too for sure, I don't have to worry too much about cash, job security is rock solid, I get substantial attention from girls, people respect me for what I do, and the field is dynamic so it never gets boring.
All things considered, I don't know if I'm being unreasonable to think about switching careers, especially after having spent so much time and effort in medicine. But I mean what else could I do? I don't particularly like research, and none of the clinical fields I have encountered thus far appeal to me either...

60496,106902,"Everyone has read the news about salary increment for junior doctors but their working hours are horrific.
It's common to work more than 100 hours a week (a week is not a typo) with all the 32-hour on calls and they under report their actual working hours to not get flagged in the system since they are not remunerated for the extra hours anyway. The so called at least 1 day off in 7 days is non-existent because my husband has only gotten 1 day off out of 32 days (32 days is not a typo too) of continuous working.
Sometimes I wonder if my husband will die from overworking.

60506,106924,"Currently a student in Finance, working in a MNC.
I have been holding this annoyance for a while and wish to get it off my chest and gain some opinions. I felt that I was wrongly blamed.
I have recently joined a new company and I’m the youngest. My team consist of about 8 of us and most of them are in their mid 30s.
2 weeks ago I was tasked to choose a place for our team lunch. It is a tradition where the youngest usually is the one choosing the place. I was given less than a day to think.
It is known that there are quite a few factors to consider:
1. There are 3 lacto-vegetarians in my team. As such, the restaurants need to have vegetarian options.
2. We worked at Buona Vista and our lunch need to be quick as we have important work to finish. This also means it needs to be nearby. For dinner, there must be additional of alcohol as we have heavy drinkers in the team.
3. The ambience must be pleasant and nice. No coffee shop, no rundown places.
4. They want a generally expensive place. (It is known as they are quite well-to-do individuals). They won’t settle for coffeeshop. FYI, our first team dinner when I joined the company was for 8 pax at Artemis and we spend close to $2000 for it. The company paid for it.
I tried finding around Holland Village for a restaurant with vegetarian options as it is fairly close-by and there are a few restaurants there. I found this western and Italian place with vegetarian options and suggested it to my director. Him being a vegetarian himself looked through the menu and agree to it saying “There are quite a lot of vegetarian options and ambience is okay.” I gave the menu and restaurant name to the rest of my team and they all looked through it. Pizza, pasta and some tapas are the vegetarian options.
Fast forward: After we had our lunch at the place, I overheard another director (he) and colleague (she) talking bad and laughing about the place, saying “Pizza and bread for lunch?! Hahaha.”
Shortly after I conversed with them and came to know that they don’t see pizza as a proper food item, but rather a side dish. There was no direct confrontation but just some sourness during the conversation.
I was fairly offended after. There was no direct confrontation but it still left me quite confused and angry.
For myself, I didn’t come from a very well-to-do family and I’m okay with pizza for lunch. I wouldn’t even mind going to a coffeeshop and just have noodles and rice.
My family don’t have a high status in society, just an average Singaporean. The most expensive food meal I ever have and paid myself is probably just kbbq that cost around $30+.
This is why I went an extra mile to provide them with the menu to see if they are okay with the food but the result wasn’t what I expected. There were no direct objections at the start and I thought they are totally fine with it. After getting negative gossips behind my back over this makes me feel upset.
What do you think? If it is you, would you be upset?

60504,106921,"Brothers and sisters, help me out here. There is this creep who I've met during orientation and he followed me on Instagram. He doesn't post on his account, but I always see that he views all my instastories and likes most of my posts. He's fat and ugly and I heard from my friends he's a loner and probably has been single all his life. This has been going on for a few months now. I'm quite a small build and I'm worried that he is stalking me and will force himself onto me. What do I do? I feel very unsafe when alone in school as I don't exactly remember his face other than he's fat and quite tall.

60500,106915,"I wanted to add on to #106812 about fretting if a course is above one’s station. I know people doing computer science (CS) / pharmaceutical science (PHS) / Aerospace because they did well for A-Levels and chose to “upgrade” from whatever course that they wanted, only to regret later or even change course. To add insult to injury, those that stuck on may not get the high pay that they thought they would get.
Don’t be too hung up by the “prestige” or the IGP, focus on what you’re good at and what you love and. All the best!

60503,106917,"Love screws around with your head.
I’ve sleep typed to my ex multiple times. I would send something kind and loving when I’m really tired and then I’ll doze off for a while in which I’ll have a short dream about how he either replied me (obviously doesn’t happen irl) or my message. This will jolt me awake and I’ll question if I have sent it and realise I did. This happens periodically when I’m so tired. Don’t think it warrants a block because I do feel a lot for him and only want the best so all the things I’ve typed subconsciously mean well. Ah tiredness is a no no.
If you’re reading this, love you lots. Sorry for the spam, though I mean what I said!

60502,106920,"I am a NUS CS graduate and I want to share about the life I had after graduation.
To begin with, I graduated about 2 years ago. I was struggling to find a job when I graduated as I couldn't solve those leetcode questions the interviewers threw at me. I couldn't answer the other standard SWE questions either. But that was my fault, unlike my peers, I didn't prepare for the interviews and revise these CS stuff, so I naturally failed them.
After half a year of job searching, a tiny firm offered me $5k and I took it. I left after working there for a year to create a startup with my friend. And I have been working at the startup since then.
I did not have any income from the startup at all for the past 1 year, and have been burning through my measly savings. And to this day, the startup is still pretty far from succeeding, but I will probably continue doing it.
Before going further, I need to show off a bit. To begin with, I was a decent CS student, had good grades and profs knew me. When I was working with the tiny firm for that 1 year, the profit I made for the firm was at least a few million USD, it wasn't a proprietary trading firm (although I did got an offer from a trading firm during that time and turn it down as it was mediocre compared to Jane Street, but still pay better than FAANG for sure). And also after I left the tiny firm, I did get another 0.5 mil offer from a unicorn company and also turn it down (For the record, the 0.5 mil offer is not something you can get with a CS degree, it just happen that I got privately scouted as I had acquire the perfect skillset during the short stint at the tiny firm). But imho, easiest money for grads is always IB and other sales role in banking, not swe/trader. Not sure why the business faculty so cmi nowadays.
Anyways, the 0.5 mil offer made me realize that startups is really the only way to achieve crazy income as a CS graduate. There is a salary ceiling and going past the millions is not possible if u r just another employee in the company (even if u r a director). Which is why until today I still chose to work for my own startup and still poor. But I don't regret it.
Moderators can help me use chatgpt to fix the english, thanks
