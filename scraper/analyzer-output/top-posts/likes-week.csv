60676,107421,"I have been with my GF for about 7 years and everything is starting to become a bit stale. It is a stable type of relationship and I know that its time for me to commit and get a BTO, etc etc. Post-graduation, we also started working at super long hour jobs and hardly see each other except for admin talk about the future.
The thing is, I seriously wondering what is out there and if I have missed out in the 'testing' phase of life.
Recently at work, I have gotten to know a few interns that seem to show some interest in getting to know me and they have also invited me to go clubbing/drinks and meet their other friends outside of work.
A few of them have caught my eye and seriously damn tempting to just go for it. They seriously make me feel young again.
Of course, I wouldn't act on it but I'm just wondering, am I f***ed up to think this way?
