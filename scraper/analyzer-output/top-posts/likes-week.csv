61133,108252,"I came across one of Ben's old threads about aptitude and I would like to share a story. Make of it what you will.
I am not smart. I went to a neighborhood school after Nanyang Primary because I flunk my PSLE. I then did poorly for my O-levels. I hated school. I hated everything about it. I hated sitting in the same classroom for hours every day, I hated doing homework, I hated working on practice problems etc. I didn't know why I was a bad student then. I've always put it down to what people have always said about me—I'm stupid. I went straight to NS.
But I did like one thing—chess. I would spend hours playing chess on the computer, hours reading chess books, hours practicing openings and endgames, hours reading about past games of famous players. I have no talent in chess. For 3 straight years upon my first introduction to the game in primary school by my father, I lost to him. He was not a chess player. By the end of secondary school (evidently at the expense of my school work), I was competing in tournaments and beating the majority of my opponents. This was my first life lesson in how one can overcome his lack of talent. 
At 18 I decided that I wanted to focus on my studies to get into a good university. Probably important to note, my parents are very rich. After communicating this to them, I set chess aside, retook my O-levels, did well, and they sent me to attend an IB program in the UK. It was hard. My brain was slow, my attention span was poor, but I did want to succeed and that made me persist. I put myself on an extremely rigid schedule and I averaged 6 hours a sleep for two years straight. I took no days off. The result of this was a perfect 45/45 and I made it to a top 2 engineering school in the US. I'm also an FM and I play for the university chess team.
Note: I am still stupid. I always leave lectures with the feeling of ""I have no idea what I just sat through."" I typically have to spend several days mulling stuff over, working through practice problems, even re-watching old lectures of my introductory classes because I forget stuff. Since I been at college, I don't average 6 hours of sleep every day. I sneak 30-min naps throughout a day but I do pull all-nighters regularly. This doesn't seem to be the case with most of my peers, but I have definitely met people here who are here simply by virtue of their relentlessness.
Hard work can compensate for bad hardware to some degree. What Ben said was consistent with my experience. Smart kids do learn a lot quicker. If you're both smart and a workaholic, you'd probably be as good a student as Ben was. But for those who are lugging a Pentium chip, if you want to make it, you just have to sacrifice everything and work. And perhaps this is how I got in at my college in the first place. This is a place where students are known for their almost masochistic work ethic.
Now that I've started working, I am the associate partner at my firm. How did I get here? Simple. I don't stop working. I am first to arrive and last to leave. It has worked for my all my life and there's no reason why it shouldn't continue. You just work. There's no reason why you should spend time mulling over whether you have aptitude or not.

61142,108265,"My ex-boyfriend broke up with me after 4 years of our relationship. The reason is our relationship is no longer 'exciting'. We talked about getting married, building a family together, and even meeting each other's families. Everything seemed to be set and going well until suddenly one day we argued that he has changed over the years and so have I. As working adults, we don't have much time for each other except after work or the weekends. At some point, the frequency of meetings has reduced although we still call each other every day. The effort was diminishing and so was our love. Shortly after our breakup, he became aggressive about meeting new girls, chatted with them, and met up with a new one every week. 2 months after we broke up, he met this girl and posted an official couple photo on his Instagram and Facebook a month later to announce that he is now a taken man. I heard from my friends that he said the new girl isn't good-looking in a sort of tentative manner. Which I feel is not something nice and should be said about someone you are planning to date. My heart is torn into a million pieces and I can barely move on from such a heartless man. Some advice would be appreciated and maybe I am not seeing my ex for the person he is. Possibly, as an outsider a more objective POV could be provided on his character and whether or not it is time for me to truly let go of him..

61138,108259,"Although this is not NUS-related, but I hope I can get some input here. ????
I have a 4 room flat and my bf has an EA. Both of us bought this under single scheme last time. 
We always think that once we get married, one of us have to sell one of the unit. But recently there are 2 agents told me 2 different things: 
1. As long as both unit pass MOP (after 5 years), HDB won’t ask us to sell either unit. Agent A said that he called HDB and got this answer. However, we are skeptical. 
2. Another agent said, by right, HDB will send us a letter to inform us to sell either unit within 6 months. However, there are many ppl take the “by left” option. As in, HDB isn’t firm on this. 
Can any kind soul who have been in a similar situation shared some input? 
We have been putting off the idea of getting married because we are not ready to let go of either unit, for sentimental and practical reasons ????

61141,108263,"Need relationship advice???? 
We have been in a relationship for almost 4years. 
So my bf has a girl bestie he knew frm gaming, he already quited gaming since 2022. Thy don’t usually contact until she broke up with her bf in 2022. The girl doesn’t really have much friend and kinda negative/emo. So since she move out from her bf hse, she rented a hse nearby my bf house because it is near to public transport. She dont drive. 
So whenever she need to rant or smoke buddy, she will ask my bf to go over her hse. Initially, I was like ok, she just broke up, u can go and console or be her listener. Bt then now already year end of 2023, she will still ask my bf to go for smoke/chat/ranting. I started to feel uncomfortable and voice out like why are you always available to girl whenever thy need ranting? I understand if thy don’t really communicate alot, something happened, and she need someone to talk to, but not like every month or every few month right? I really dont understand why sometimes the girls keep asking someone’s bf for ranting or like hangout eventho she know he have a gf. 
So my bf reasoning was she doesn’t have much frn. In my mind i was thinking, he asked me to stop chatting with one of my guy colleague or even eat with him. His reasoning was he feel uncomfortable of that guy. So now i feel uncomfortable bcz of this, bt he keep saying that they are just brother/friend. He have to be there for her to rant.  I don’t smoke, so usually he will smoke far away from me or whenever he is in the office with his colleague. 
Anyway, idk what I’m saying anymore. Am i too insecure or my feelings is valid? Girls out thr, pls let me know ????

61145,108274,"I am studying as a final year student and also working part-time as a FA under my mum as she is the director of the biggest agencies. I have a crush on one of the managers, let’s name him A. I really like A and we can hit it off pretty well and we would sometimes hang out for supper. I know he is married with 2 kids but I do not know all the nitty gritty details of his family status (revealed later). One day, my mum caught us hanging out and scanned through my phone and the next day, she took the matter in her own hands and made him quit. She twisted the story and called for an agency meeting to announce to everyone in the workplace that he was a scumbag, and cheated on his wife which all these was confided in her when he wanted to win the wife back. Was this necessary to air his dirty laundry in public? Or to name shame him and did not spare a thought for his wife whom wanted to keep it low profile? But if he was going through a divorce, wouldn’t that make him single right? It means I have a chance right? But why did she have to condemn him like that infront of everybody else and eliminate him, even forced him to resign just so that I could not get close to him? Because he’s married with 2 kids? My mum is so mean to expose this to everyone and defame him. Whatever her speech was in the meeting room to 80 over agents, was a twist of the story and made him swallow the blame for it 100%. I feel so useless I can’t even help him, but I have to play victim too because I am afraid of my mum. That was why I hurriedly used his phone to delete all the messages, leaving him no evidence to back himself up so that my mother will believe me that he “tried” on me but in fact, I was the first who made the first move to text him lovey dovey messages. I made him lose his career and now I’m being bounded by this authoritative figure at work and at home. I have no eye candy at work anymore, no friends to talk to and it is all my fault because it was me who started giving wrong signals first to him. I will have bad karma and my mum is no.1 best at making up stories and linking them up. I have already started people name-calling me like “like mother like daughter”. What should I do?

61135,108256,"Just recently, my girlfriend broke up with me. We had been together for a few years, and while our lifestyles had been slightly different, there did not seem to be major issues (though in retrospect I think we might have bottled up some of our issues a bit much, and I think she did so to a lot more of how she felt).
My biggest difficulty in coming out of this now is I can't stop thinking of how similar we are, like in terms of our values, family and economic backgrounds, our generally introvert personalities, our past (before we got together) and many more factors that drew me to her in the first place. It's hard to imagine finding someone else as compatible, and that's despairing.
I did a bit of reading and talking to friends, and I know that this is a common part of break-ups. How do you get past this phase, and what does it take to possibly meet someone else?

Totally agree on the classroom magic thingy. Hahahaha.

Do your friends get surprise after seeing your image in the classroom? Is it a purposefully constructed image like those of idol/actor industry? 
Perhaps prof Ben could help explain... since so far I only saw prof Ben comments on the forum.
