60246,106371,"For the ladies out there who have never been in a relationship or dating before, as a female myself (25 yo, NUS alumni), I want to share on some important notes before you start dating or a relationship.
1) Actions from guys are more important than words. Yes, a guy may claim he miss you, text you good morning, say will bring you you to xxx, say will do xxx. If they are just saying without any actions done CONSISTENTLY, then it is just plainly talking.
2) Please don’t accept a relationship just because you are afraid to be alone or already in the so called “typical age range to get married” or most of your friends are attached. Rather to be alone than to be in a relationship/marriage suffering!!
Side track: according to book I read, the most important things in life for a lady are:
A) Health
B) Own savings
C) Family and Females Besties (see guy is not in the list)
3) Watch out for his body language. If a guy CONSISTENTLY:
A) Keep his phone/phone screen away from you
B) Disallow you from using his phone
Explanation for A and B: he does that because he has something fishy to hide.
C) Never want to put your couple picture as his dp or post on social media or even discourage you to do so. Delete your couple photos on his phone.
Explanation for C: He considers himself to be in the “bachelor” market. Means he is still looking around for his partner or even scared of people seeing you two together.
D) Always talk about himself and rarely entertain you
Explanation for D: One sided. He only want companionship. There should be give and take.
E) Always online on WhatsApp/Telegram but take 10000 years to reply your messages
No need to explain you should know why.
F) Say “none of your business”.
This is a major red flag. In a relationship, you all are supposed to work and listen together, not one don’t care about the other.
G) Don’t know what he wants in a relationship. Even after months.
H) Flirting and Cheating. When someone flirted and cheated although he has you, it means that your relationship is not that strong enough to begin and typically he will not suddenly change his heart overnight. So please do yourself a favour to distance away from him. Why tolerate someone like that?
I) Always texting a lot of female friends. Go to female friends’ house alone and not with a group of people.
J) Not willing to fork out money for meals/trips on YOU. If a guy is cash stripped because of his family situation (eg. Take care of family/pay loan/debt), it is understandable. Otherwise, the typical guy will always have more than money to spend on you on meals. Imagine a guy having difficulties parting with his money at the dating stage/while in a relationship, and imagine if you were to have kids with him, he definitely want you to spilt/pay for the hospital bills and baby accessories expenses. Would you ever want that?
Side note: a typical guy will chat with more than one girl online/in person. Please keep your eyes open and don’t put 100% heart into the relationship unless you feel reciprocated. Otherwise you will get hurt.
4) I suggest ladies to watch videos from Stephanspeaks YouTube Channel (yes I am a fan of him). From his channel, I learned that a guy who truly wants to be with you would put 100% effort and his heart to be with you. He will be willing to spend money and time with you. No excuses. No mind games. You will be his priority other than his job.
Thanks for reading up to here :). I have been in the above situations blindly until I woke up finally. It has been very heartbreaking for me since I put my 100% heart into it. I cried alot and felt depressed and I am recovering from it now. At least I am thankful for recognising it at the start of the relationship.

I would probably rate myself higher then him as I am Smart (I am a scholar) ,I come from a well to do family eg (we can afford to go on at least one holiday per year)
Looks Wise I think I am okay, I get loads of looks and many guys have confessed to me...
However this guy is different especially religion wise.
The odd thing is this guy I feel can do way better than me, he is always thinking 10 steps ahead and he always talks about how to help others or come out with solutions to help people and businesses
He's doing okay academically, he plans for a masters too ,and this makes me happy
However my parents think that he's not smart because his from SIM and they harbor many stereotypes, eg he will drink a lot ,when in fact he doesn't.
and they think he would cheat on me , funny when my mum already suspects my dad has cheated on her
How do convince them otherwise???

60250,106381,"When your partner tells you they love you, ask yourself if it’s because they love you for who you are as an individual or because of what they can get you to do for them.
It’s easy to be “loved” by someone:
1. if they always get their way with you around
2. if you sacrifice your individuality and ditch all your own interests/hobbies and take on your partner’s ones instead.
3. if your partner doesn’t care about your interests but can make you sit through theirs.
4. when your partner knows they can give you the bare minimum without you realising that you deserve better.
If your partner tells you they love you, ask yourself if you’ve changed everything you’ve been doing/enjoying prior to meeting him/her. Then ask yourself if your partner has even expressed any interest in your passions, much less changed any of their interests to align with yours? If the first answer is yes and the second answer is no, there’s a big chance they ""love you"" because you’ve become another them rather than because of who you are.
Talk is cheap and just because someone is good at being a boyfriend/girlfriend, doesn’t mean they will be a good life-long partner. And someone saying “I love you” to convince you they love you, doesn’t necessarily reflect the truth. Don’t let someone’s “I love you” stop you from realising that it might just be used as a tool to keep you there for their benefit rather than a sincere declaration.

60245,106369,"Honestly, imho, the culture and social construct of 'cheap' food should just go.
Don't get me wrong, it's not about being able to 'afford' or wanting to pay 'so much' for food, nor is it about the you so rich, you like to pay, you go and do it yourself kind of thing.
Would you yourself earn peanuts for the amount of effort you put in? You complain other people expensive, but what about yourself, are you yourself 'expensive', for the job that you do.
Just as you have bills to pay for? So do food vendors and hawkers. Just as there is a certain standard of living and amount of wages you want to have, so do they. The selfish mentality of I earn alot but others should earn as little as possible so that i can save and earn more should just....go. Humans are inherently selfish and self centered, which prolly contributes to policies such as minimum wages in other countries.
No money, don't eat. Eat air. Eat rocks. Asking stallholders why they charge so high is equivalent to someone asking you why you earn so much. You want their skills and food, PAY.
A contribution to a more harmonious society and decrease in poverty would be having a balance of income and spend. Otherwise, selfishness and self centeredness of humanity would just contribute to our eventual doom, just like what we are doing to Mother Earth. :)

60231,106345,"Sometimes, I really don’t understand the purpose of a dating app anymore. I mean the whole real purpose is to find people to date while I understand some uses it to find ONS/FWB/hookups (how dating apps have been evolving to such use over the years) but why are there attached people trying to look for ‘online’ friends to talk to when they have their partners/real life friends to talk to? And they’re more opened to talk about their problems to strangers instead. Am I being very narrow-minded for having thoughts like that because somehow I feel it’s a form of emotional cheating to their partners? Not unless they have their partners’ consent to do it or they firmly know their intention to just find friends on the app when there’re probably other ways to look for friends instead of on a dating app.

60244,106368,"Dear Prof Ben, I am an undergraduate student who is applying for campus accommodation and I would like to ask why is the application fee ($27) for hostels in NUS so expensive? Students like us who haven't started working may possibly just lose this $27 if they fail to receive an accommodation offer, which is highly likely given the high demand and low supply, and this amount is certainly not small.
To put things into perspective, HDB only charge couples $10 when they apply for a BTO. May I know who allows UHMS to dictate the price of the application fee and is there anyone in NUS ensuring that this application fee doesn't get ridiculously high over the years? Thank you!

60235,106353,"There is a bird called jiji. One day, while jiji was doing its morning hunt, it got shot down and lost its conscience. When jiji woke up, it found itself in a palace, closed in a golden cage with another bird called miamo.
Jiji then asked miamo how it landed there, and miamo said jiji was shot down and thereafter got locked up tgt. Jiji got panicked and asked miamo how to escape. Miamo told jiji 'there's no need to escape. If you stay here with me, I will share all the exquisite worms and offer you my fresh water, and we can be best buds. In fact, I asked the king to keep you in, he actually wanted to slaughter you cause he was craving bird meat, but he granted my request since I am his favorite pet.'
Jiji looked around the cage and the palace, and after putting in some thought, jiji decided to give it a shot. After spending some time with miamo, jiji fell in love.
One day, when miamo left for grooming, jiji overheard two guards' conversation that miamo was the one that requested the king to shoot jiji down because miamo had been lonely for a long time that Miamo had never seen a bird like jiji that is purple. The fur shines like a diamond, so miamo asks the king to bring jiji back. The guard also mentioned that once, miamo told the king, 'Yikes! After getting to know jiji, I found out that jiji has body odour! It reeks! And you know what? Jiji coat is not the glittery purple coat I imagined it to be! There is a black undercoat beneath the purple. I thought it was beautiful, turns out to be a fake! In fact, I saw another beautiful bird that is red, and I could have gotten that instead. What a waste!'
Once jiji heard that, jiji was beyond heartbroken. Jiji could no longer look into miamo eyes or speak to miamo. Jiji felt like its heart was torn into a million pieces.
Jiji knew this was no longer the place for it. One is raised in the palace that is used to the rules and lifestyle, while the other is a wild bird that enjoys freedom and carefreeness. Jiji then carefully curates its exit plan without anyone knowing. After planning and executing the perfect plan, jiji finally got out of the cage. Jiji flew and flew so far that it reached a place it had never found itself before.
Jiji was tired out and took a rest. Then all the emotions hit, and jiji finally let loose and let everything out. Jiji looked back at the time it spent with miamo and missed it a lot. But jiji knew they were different and feelings were not mutual. At one point, jiji thought maybe this was the lifestyle it could settle for, but once jiji knew the truth, it could never be where it was because everything just seemed so shady and shallow. Which of the moment was true? Jiji never knew and could never put in the same level of trust anymore.
A few years have passed since the incident, Miamo and jiji are both leading their separate lives. Miamo is still enjoying its exquisite worm and luxurious palace life, while Jiji goes for the usual morning hunt. They may no longer be together, but life has become quieter, more peaceful, and more secure.

I met the girl who ltr became my gf while I was at an group event with my mom. As y'all can imagine (I think), we tend to act more conservatively with our parents around, that being said, we won't be speaking in the same kind of tone and language we usually does with our friends and peers, or even to pick up girls in front of our parents. I soon took a liking to her personality and rly wanted to at least make friends with her, but I just felt awkward to approach her in my mom's presence.
But my mom being a super sociable person, made friend with her, and often like to invite her over for a meal. And I took the chance to jio her out too. Soon we became friends whom hanged out often and then a couple, after I confessed.
But the problem is, im not sure how should I tell my mom about this.
The main pt I rly wanna convey is, in the event of a break-up, chances are we can't go back to being friends again and may cut contact, and I hope for my mom to respect that by stop inviting her over or better wise, not contact her too.
I rly dont wish to come across as being controlling of my mom's freedom to hang out with her, but I think anyone who has been through a peaceful but sad breakup understands the implication of this.

60251,106382,"Advice on leaving my job after one year due to bad management?
Hi all, it is the start of a new year and the start of a job hunting period. I have landed my first job in a consulting firm doing technology consulting in December 2021... My work is overall alright but I'm feeling unmotivated to work mainly due to poor management. As I have reached my one year mark, I am considering alternative options and appreciate some advice from seasoned practitioners on whether I should leave my current firm.
Firstly, there is no useful feedback from my manager. Whenever I ask my manager about my performance or how is the team performing, it is always just one word ""good"". He always mention that he would like to work out a career roadmap with everyone in the team, but I realised that he had never done so with anyone in the team, over the 3 years he has been in the company. I initiated a one to one meeting with him to discuss my career progression, but during the session he told me he will consider and somehow brushed it aside. My team have pitched in several advices over the past year to improve our work efficiency and quality but those have been ignored as well. Also heard from colleagues in the other teams that my manager could be afraid to share feedback with us as we might get ""hurt and unmotivated"". Overall, there is a lack of long term development for the team and I am unsure of how I can further improve my personal and work capabilities.
Secondly, I am more invested in developing my expertise in a different area of tech consulting, which makes me wonder if this job is right for me. My manager did however mention vaguely that I am on track for a promotion next year, similar as to how most consultants get promoted after 2 years in the job. I am conflicted as to whether I should stay and wait for a promotion, or forgo the opportunity for promotion, to start afresh in another role. I also know that 1 year is a relatively short period of time to stay in a company and so I am afraid that this will reflect badly on my future career prospects.

60232,106346,"So I have known this guy for a while and I think we have mutual interest in each other.
Recently he told a 'third party' that we know mutually that he has several frustrations towards me that I am unaware of.
Some context is that I have a lot of guy friends in my circle. I have known for over a decade, and some I knew would always have my back. We are very playful when we are together because why not? Life is too short to be serious all the time. Besides, we have been like this since we met each other.
So I heard of a few frustrations but to be honest, idk what the whole thing is also la. Like this third party blabbering this that this that. Idk what is this that la. But one thing I can relate to is having fun with my bros lo.
So one day he asks what I am doing, and I being stupid, just say the truth lo. Then you know what? He called me 'chicken' ley. In translation is like, you know geylang chicken? Wah I blank out sia. Never in my life have I met someone so disrespectful. So I got real pissed off, I just stop contacting him. Afterall you cannot teach someone to respect you when they show zero respect right? Like you cannot explain to a dumbo what is wrong when they are dumb right?
Then hor idk he ki siao or what start showing me he hang out with a group of girls. I'm like okay lo. Fair ma, I got my male friends who am I to comment about him having girlfriends right. But I won't call him quack quack la cos I am not raised to stoop to the level when they are being rude ma. But biang as I look back still angry sia. After that he said sorry, so tho I am still angry, I decided to letgo la. Ppl make mistakes and we cant always harp on to it.
For the rest of frustrations idk what is the blabbering about. But would y'all give up friends you knew for over a decade or always have your back in life and death situation over someone you knew for a couple of months? For me is a no brainer thing. If I have to choose between friendship and relationship, maybe this is not the relationship right? Relationship is about growing, complimenting etc. The way I see it is like shrinking, devaluing me, demoralizing. Who is to blame? Me lo kiampa.
The funny thing is he said he told me many times he didn't like this that this this this. whatto??? Like what is this what is that and when huh?? Biang idk ley. halp la. Then I found out he string many girls along and still dared call me chicken??? kns ley. I said aiya you like so much then you go find one of the girls lo. Then he went. Haahha I give up la.

It’s actually about this girl from my course. She’s really quiet, looks wise not too bad and she’s really sweet. Hands down the sweetest girl I’ve ever met, she’s genuinely caring, generous and very humble even though she’s really rich and smart (typical RGS girl). There’s only one issue; she’s EXTREMELY unhygienic and filthy. She rarely washes her oily hair and has a habit of rewarding her clothes. She also has the same unwashed hoodie that she’s been using every day for at least the 2 years that I’ve known her.
At first I thought she was just naturally oily and pimple prone until we organised an early Christmas party (second week of December). Long story short we played with fake powdered snow and it got everywhere. Our group met up again a few days later and one of the girls commented to her discreetly that she had “dandruff” but upon closer inspection I realised that it was the powdered snow. She washed/rinsed her hair afterwards and we had another get together for the New Years. She didn’t have any of the powdered snow in her hair but when she pulled her hair back behind her ears, I s2g she had it around her ear canal. I nearly threw up thinking about it because it’s been more than 2 weeks and somehow she didn’t wash her ears or shower because that powdered snow washes off really easily.
Our dinner was at this western grill place i observed her while she ate a lamb rib then look around for more tissues and couldn’t find any near her so she reached down under the table and wiped her oily fingers either on her jeans or the underside of the table then “washed” them with the condensation on her drink.
Actually she’s a really sweet girl but she’s so fucking dirty and unhygienic that it’s a massive turn off 0/10 and idk if I should say anything or just pretend not to notice. Has anyone ever met someone like that before? She’s 20+ btw

If we were more mature and meet again in the future, I would still date you again.
But for now, the future seems bright and full of possibilities. I also wouldn’t go back to you if I find the right one.
It was really great meeting you. I wish you nothing but the best in the future for your studies and work

60248,106376,"Part 2 of Jiji and Miamo:
As the years went by, Jiji learned to adapt to its new life in the wild. It had found a new community of birds to live with and had even made a few close friends.
Despite everything that had happened with Miamo, Jiji still couldn't help but wonder what had become of its old friend. It had often thought about reaching out to Miamo, but it wasn't sure if that was the right thing to do.
One day, Jiji received some unexpected news: Miamo had been released from the palace and was living in the wild as well. Jiji was surprised but also happy to hear that Miamo was out of the cage and able to fly freely.
Jiji decided to pay Miamo a visit and see how it was doing. When Jiji arrived, it was surprised to see that Miamo had built a beautiful nest for itself and seemed to be thriving in its new life.
Miamo was happy to see Jiji as well and apologized for what had happened in the past. It explained that it had been lonely and had made a selfish decision to bring Jiji to the palace. It said that it had learned its lesson and was sorry for any pain it had caused.
Jiji listened to Miamo's apology and felt a sense of forgiveness towards its old friend. It was happy to see that Miamo was doing well and decided to put the past behind them.
From then on, Jiji and Miamo remained close friends and enjoyed each other's company. They had both learned valuable lessons about forgiveness and friendship and were grateful to have each other in their lives.

60236,106354,"To #106350, i think if one party chooses to give up already then dont force it. Its not a sudden 1 day thing that they suddenly stop loving you. I personally feel like if you really love the guy let him go, you forcing things only shows how selfish you are ( even to yourself). If its to the stage where he says he doesnt love you anymore, then u should know to leave because nothing is going to change anything. And theres really zero chance that you can change anything, uou selfishness will end up hurting both him and urself in the end.
