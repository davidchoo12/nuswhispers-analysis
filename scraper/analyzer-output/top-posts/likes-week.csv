60679,107477,"Is there a stigma against being an heir of a large-ish family business in Singapore?
My father founded a construction firm that gradually pivoted into real estate investments over a 30-year career. He has two children, my older brother and me. My older brother is highly educated and substantially older than I am. He went to the best IP school, then he attended Princeton for undergrad and has an MBA from Columbia. I was sent to Australia after doing badly for O-levels and I graduated with an accounting degree from Monash. My father is sort of old school. Because I'm a girl and the younger sibling, he doesn't believe that I should have anything to do with the business. After many an argument with him, I resigned to it as the way life just is. My dad has never refused money whenever I have asked for it. He never skimped on my education. More importantly, my brother treats me very well. He always pays for everything whenever I go out with him. He also contributed to my husband's student loans when my dad stood his ground and refused to help. I reasoned with myself that I already received far more than I should have had given my dad's culture.
My father got into some health issues recently and his greatest wish is for my brother to take over the family business. My brother, now working in New York City, refuses to grant him his wish. The only reason that I have ever heard from him is the fact that he doesn't want to be perceived as someone who inherited a fortune and did nothing to deserve it. The AUM of my father's company, just for context, is well into the high 8-figures (this was a pre-Covid estimate). To me, it seems natural for a child to take over his parent's business. It may not have squared with me that it had to be the first male child, but I never saw anything wrong with having a child for an heir. I attended a swanky foundation studies program in Melbourne and I have met many Singaporeans and Malaysians who are in-line to take over massive family businesses. If I had a successful business, my instinct is also to pass it on to the people I trust the most, in all likelihood it will be my children.
I really can't be bothered what my brother decides to do. I just think his reason for doing it is a little puzzling. Is there really a stigma in Singapore against children taking over family businesses? I see children taking over hawker stalls all the time. I also see children taking over wet market stalls, children taking over frozen seafood businesses, air-con service businesses, distributorships, and these are just the ones I know personally. It shouldn't be that big of a deal to take over a business that someone genuinely wants to give you should it?
What do you guys think?

60680,107511,"When people say that being short is not a problem, I feel that it is a dogwater statement.
First, closely scrutinize your own surrounding. In your workplace, how many of your higher-ups are actually short? If you ever see a short one, I bet that this guy had put in extra effort than the rest to get to where he is. The rest are just playing the corporate game on an easy mode. Also, what can be worse than being vertically challenged and bullied verbally by a taller boss? How many of you can actually stomach that?
Second, observe social media and the showbiz industry. Do guys of height (~170cm) form the norm, other than a few outliers such as Tom Cruise? Absolutely not.
Third, look at all those male insurance agents and survey personnels approaching you on the street. How many of them are not above 6 feet? Obviously this cannot be a coincidence. They are carefully chosen because they look good parading their own height and marketing the products at the same time.
Fortunately it is not too late. Short guys may be deprived of many opportunities but there is at least one thing that can be done. To all the short kings out there, get the highest education qualification and work hard. Not many people in the world have the ability to reach that level. You can avoid the situation of being bossed around in future with a good quality degree.
