60865,107687,"TW: R*pe / SA. Need to ask everyone's opinion here. Also long story but please do read. 
So a guy (Let's call him Matt) and his gf (Let's call her Jenn) lives together. They've been doing good together, until one day, they argue about going to a night club. Let's just say Matt doesn't want Jenn to go to a night club cause he's worried about her safety.
But Jenn insist, saying she'll be just fine. Matt still wouldn't allow it. So they argued a lot. Jenn however, always find a way to go to the club. Either by lying about her location, made excuses, or simply just wait for Matt to fall asleep early. Everytime Matt found out, he'll get mad cause he's so worried about her. Jenn however, continued to do this like more than 10 times, and got caught by Matt at least 7 times. 
Matt is very forgiving, but even he has a limit. The only thing he doesn't want Jenn to do is to go to a night club. That's it. Nothing else. But Jenn didn't care. Matt told her, that if she goes there again, one more time, the relationship is over. Jenn, thinking it's just another chance, simply just go out anyways. She doesn't care anymore. 
Unfortunately for that night, after hours in the night club, she got r*ped and SAed by a guy there. She called Matt, crying, told him everything that happened. Matt immediately drove and picked her up, went to the hospital and police station immediately to make reports and gather all those evidence. Took hours, 
but thankfully, the evidence gathered are clear, and the police said for now, they can go home while they go make an arrest on the suspect. It was very late night at that point. 
Matt, however, drove Jenn back to her parents' house. Jenn feeling confused and asked why. Matt said that he's sorry about everything that happened to her and it's not her fault, however, he's a man of his word. He said that he did warned her that if she goes to the club one more time, the relationship is over. Regardless of what happens, even if she's safe and nothing bad happen, the relationship is still over. Matt did say that if she needed help about the case, he'll help. But that doesn't mean he and Jenn are together. 
He already packed every Jenn's belongings from his house the moment she walked out to go to the club. All of it is in the car, and he carried it for her to her parents'. Jenn, crying and begging, asking him not to leave her and said she won't do it again. Matt however, said that he has his limit too. And he said why does it need for this horrible thing to happen then only she'll listen. Before he leaves, he told her again, that he's sorry about what happened, and that if she needed any help with the case, he'll help. But that's it. 
So, the question is, is Matt wrong for doing what he did in the end?

60858,107672,"Prof Ben,
This will be a rather unique message to the ones you typically receive because I don’t have a question for you. What I do have is a thank you. Thank you for saving my life.
When I was at NUS, I was a struggling student; not because I was getting bad grades, but because I chose a course for the income and prestige not because it was a natural choice for me. I was in NUS med. Yet I was always better with languages than I was in science. I did well out of just a good mastery of studying techniques but I wasn't interested in the medicine nor any of the biological sciences.  
The other reason why I forced myself to enroll in medicine was because I was always under the impression that only the smartest people did medicine. My brother was doing medicine at Imperial at the time and I just really didn't want to lose. It didn't help that my dad was a cardiothoracic surgeon and my mom is a scientist at a biotech company. Nobody forced me to take medicine, it was my choice.
I hated every second of it. By the end of the third year, I genuinely wanted to kill myself. I was in such a dark place because even though I was doing well in school, I had zero passion for the subject. But I was in so deep at that point I thought that I was going to spend the rest of my life doing this. One dark night, I almost had enough Ibuprofen to overdose, but I stopped myself. I spent that night crying in the bomb shelter of my house. 
Out of a desperate search for an identity, I borrowed some of the legal textbooks of my best friend and I discovered a real love for the subject, in particular, American constitutional law. After a few months of getting into deep conversations with my friend, I was hooked. At the same time, I came across a piece that you wrote about perfectly intelligent people being good at one thing but not another. I just didn't have the stamina for medicine mostly because I did not have the slightest interest in seeing another picture of a scrotal fungal infection.
I decided to sit down for ultimatum talks with my parents to allow me to drop out. Because I had been out of sorts for at least 3 years by then, it was more of a relief to my dad that I had that conversation with him. He told me that he was going to support me regardless of what I wanted to do. I dropped out. I did some research and I decided that I wanted to do law in the US. I didn't want to do a gap year, so I picked a small state school with rolling admissions and unrestricted semester course loads and I finished my 4-year degree in political science and philosophy in 2.5 years. Guess what? This fall will be my last year at Harvard Law. I plan to do a doctorate and go into teaching.
The main takeaway from this is the fact that not only should people not beat themselves up over not having a gift to be good at their chosen ""thing,"" even if one has indeed been good at something, it doesn't mean that it is what they ought to be doing. People called a witch-hunt for you earlier this year because I think people fundamentally mistook you for allegedly claiming that people without an aptitude in one thing are stupid and will never be good at anything. Even though I don't doubt that there could be people who are mediocre at everything, there will always be something that they could do that they will have more passion and talent at than every other thing. Do that.

60880,107711,"I hate my brother. Whenever he’s gaming, he would shout profanities and nonsense across the room. But when he is around girls, he pretends to be all gentleman-like, such as holding the door, taking the side road, and offering to cover the bill.
I know this because I often overheard him telling his gaming friends how regretful he would be after the date. He would say kinds of stuff like if the girl turns out to be pretty, it would at least make the meal worthwhile. Or if the girl isn't pretty, then she should be at least wealthy to take the bill. After which, he and his friends would try strategies on how to get the girl to pay next time to cut costs while still maintaining a gentleman-like appearance. Eeew.. I’m so offended that he’s my brother. I don’t want to be associated with someone like that.
And guess what..? He often rates his date with his friends like some ah pek sitting in the Kopitiam gossiping. Seriously.. I’m so embarrassed by him. Sometimes when my friends were over, they would tell me they could hear my brother's convo and complain about how uncouth they were and that they didn’t know guys were like that. I tried explaining not all are.. 
Sigh.. I guess I gotta resign to my fate having a brother like him. He’s not doing justice to the real man out there. I hope my future partner will be nothing like him. Guys.. Please make the world a better place and try, at least try..? not to be like that lah... Please? :(

60873,107697,"Sorry long rant ahead. AITA for not wanting to pay for my mom’s new BTO? 
For context, I just recently graduated from NUS and is holding an average paying job of 5k a month. My mom is a single mom as my dad passed, and she has gotten a new BTO recently. She is working as an admin and earns about 3k monthly. As the sale proceeds of our current flat is not enough to cover the new flat, she wants me to top up the balance using my cpf as she thinks i’m capable since i’m working already. 
My mom has very traditional values. She didn’t explicitly say but is planning to give the house to my bro after he gets married as she feels is the male responsibility to provide a house for his wife. Similarly, she also expects my bf side to be able to provide a house for our marriage. However I told her this is not the case for Singapore as couples usually BTO. I have already successfully BTO-ed with my fiancé and is planning to save up to pay for my own house. 
She said i’m selfish for not offering my cpf to pay for her house but i told her it is not my responsibility to do so. It is also not my decision to buy a new house. I’m already giving her $800 a month as allowance, which i believe is higher than average as compared to the market given that she’s a single mom. But she still seems to be ungrateful and thinks that I SHOULD be giving her the money. 
Also, there are 2 rooms in the current house (3 room flat) so she gives one room to my bro and i share a room with her. I’m fine with it but my last straw was that she wants to invite my bro’s gf to move into his room while my bro is in the army, so that they can meet asap when my bro comes back from the army. My bro’s gf is not singaporean so she rents a room outside. I told her that this is unfair to me as i would like to have my own room as well, and she should offer the empty room to me to stay instead of his gf while he is in army. But she said since he is a boy he should have the room no matter what. 
After the whole fight she told me I am very selfish and told me to get out. I told her my BTO isn’t ready and my bf side also doesn’t have the conditions for me to move in. It’s so frustrating living together. 
Please let me know if I’m the asshole as she has already gaslighted me into thinking that I am one.

60861,107682,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice. I'm going on my first staycation with my new girlfriend this weekend. We've been together for about 2 months and this is the first time we will be intimate. All throughout my life, I've worn highly padded shoes. I'm in between 160-170cm, but I've been doing this so long that I know how to make my height look like a large 180cm. I know my girlfriend likes it because she's complimented me a couple of times. This weekend, however, I'm afraid that my girlfriend will be disappointed when our shoes finally come off. I really like this girl and don't want to upset or lose her. What should I do?

60887,107727,"Prof Ben always tells us to consider three things before getting married/into a relationship: religion, kids and money. 
Right, that's great and all, but what if your view changes halfway through? Any guide on that? So when I was 20, I got into my current relationship with my BF, we agreed that it would be nice to have 2 kids. But over the years, we changed our minds and decided to have 1 kid. BUT recently (like around 2021-now) I have really changed my mind again and want 0 kids.  BF still wants one kid.  Now we are 25 and 26 and when this topic comes up, the misalignment feels so off putting. I literally am so childfree and have no maternal urge at this point. This could potentially be dealbreaker stuff, but I do love him a lot and I want to solve this. 
How do we come to a compromise?

60881,107714,"To those in a rs, I never unds why it is so hard to stay faithful to your partner. Not saying this applies to all, but a subset. 
If you’ve decided to commit yourself to your partner, then stick thru thick and thin. Temptation is always there, and feelings fade, but for what you standby shall not.
What constitutes cheating? Imo emotional is worst off than physical. I’m not interested in being a third party in someone’s rs. So even if you have no respect for others, please have some respect for yourself. If you can’t be with the person at their worse, you don’t deserve their best.

60883,107720,"I am very conflicted about whether I should trust him again. 
I met this guy on a dating app and we hit off quite well. We really enjoy each other’s company and he seems to really care about me. After dating for around 4 months, he asked me to be his gf. However, i am not sure of my feelings for him, not because I don’t like him but because it is moving too fast. 
I told him not yet and he was quite annoyed. After asking for a few more times, he stopped. But we still go out quite frequently. 
One day, to my horror, when he was showing me something on his phone, I saw, on the notification bar, a girl name with some heart shaped emoji. I asked him who is that and he said it’s just a friend. I was not convinced but I try not to think too much about it. 
The following week, my friend told me she saw him and a girl at orchard road. She describes them behaving like a couple and I am sure there is something going on. I went to confront him about it and instead of apologizing for seeing another person, he blamed me for taking too long to decide if I want him. I was speechless and I told him I don’t want to see him anymore. 
I cried myself to sleep that night, a part of me wondered if my hesitation has caused him to cheat. But another part of me felt that if he really loved me, he would never have done that. He should have waited a bit more for me to be ready. But I was so confused and I felt so worthless because I can be so easily replaced. 
3 days later, he texted me to apologized about his words and actions. He invited me to the place where we had our first date and he told me I am the only one he loves and when he went out with the other girl, he was testing if he can have that same special feeling towards her. But he didn’t so, he ended things with her because he realized I am the one. He told me I hurt him when I did not agree to become his gf.
The date ended off quite well and I felt so happy that he is mine again. However, I am not sure if he can be trusted, but at the same time I don’t want to lose him again. 
I am very conflicted and I hope I can get some advice.

""Life is what you make of it. You are dealt a pack of cards, your DNA is fixed by your mother and your father; you maybe siblings but you may get different parts and parcels of the DNA. Your job is to make the best of the cards that had been handed out to you – what can you do well; what you cannot do well and what you are worst at."" — Lee Kuan Yew
I understand where you're coming from. I was a high-achiever early in my life and suffered when school became more about learning skills than just raw giftedness. I also went to RI and flunked out of JC. In my situation I hadn't yet failed but I could smell that failure was coming. I decided to drop out in September of J1. My dad was a realtor and I decided to enter the industry. After NS I continued working as a realtor until I was 26 (by which point I already saved up a substantial amount of money because I live an extremely frugal lifestyle). I don't want to live the rest of my life as a PA. I knew I had to go back to school. I signed up for 4 A-level subjects and I took a year off to study. I got AABC my first try and then I decided to take it again the next year. I then achieved 4As. With those results I applied to medical school in the UK. I'm now a man in his early 30s reading a medical degree at Imperial College London. My father is paying even though I could afford it myself if I wanted to, but he insisted. 
I'm not naturally conscientious. I daydream in classes because I learn quickly. The effort to really sit down after a class to revise material is the hard part because in your mind you probably think that you already understand it. Understanding and being able to reproduce it on a test are completely different skills. So I set aside a couple hours of each down and I make it a habit to physically sit down for x amount of hours regardless of how much I think I know. It was torture at the beginning but now I'm so used to it that I don't think about it anymore. Took me a while to understand this. Nobody in my life has ever told me that I need to work for my grades. 
School isn't only about raw intelligence. It's a bit like having perfect pitch doesn't make you a better musician automatically. I understand what you're going through completely and I hope you know that you're not alone. I'm not saying that I'm highly intelligent, but many highly intelligent people I know also suffer from this issue of drifting off in class because they often get too bored with how easy the material is. The difference between knowing down to the force of how to hit a tennis ball and actually hitting it like Federer is in the hours. A student with good studying techniques will trump a highly intelligent person who doesn't study every single time. If instead of learning how to add, you learnt by heart every single permutation by which two numbers can be added and their answers; you'd test better. You want to know how those competitive speed cubers solve their cubes so quickly? They don't just learn the algorithms, they actually memorize.

I don’t want to risk my reputation but here is my two cents about dialects.
Dialects allow you to appreciate your culture and traditions. It is one of the more effective ways you can connect with the past since language is not just a skill it is how you think.
That being said I don’t think connecting with one’s roots is as important as some people think it is. It is entirely possible for people to go about their entire lives without facing any practical challenges without knowing anything about your traditions. If you work your entire life as an programmer, I don’t think your traditions will ever be relevant. Some people put a lot of weight on this, whatever makes them happy. There is no requirement for any 21st century human to appreciate their own history if they don’t want to as long as you’re not lacking in scientific literacy and numeracy. 
My parents did not speak any other language other than English. They don’t celebrate CNY. We always travel over CNY holidays. I stopped using Chinese since after my higher Chinese O level many many years ago. I make a good living so evidently all the doom and gloom that people seem to think will happen if we abandon our roots did not affect my life one bit.
We are Singaporeans and we were founded on pragmatic values. There’s nothing wrong with your decisions as long as you make a good living. Ignore the haters.

60882,107719,"There are 4 grades of parents. 
Grade 1a: supportive parents both financially and emotionally.This are kind of parents will pay for the children overseas or local education. They give their children freedom to explore, respectful of their children opinion, occasionally guiding them without being intrusive. They may also inject cash into the children start up or house.
Grade 1b. Emotionally supportive but unable to support financially as grade 1a parents
Grade 2: neutral parents. They don't demand excessive allowance nor do they offer much useful advice，but they do give children freedom to explore
Grade 3a: somewhat toxic parents. They occasionally demand excessive allowance and occasionally criticize you for whatever you do. You can never get up to the standard
Grade 3b: like grade 3a but more constant verbal abuse
Grade 4a: physically abusive parents. Coming home drunk and beating up the kids
Grade 4b: this group of parents is minority and may involve sexual abuse.
Most parents are going fall into group 2. Some group 1b and some group 3a.

60867,107689,"The dating scene has gotten progressively worse with the increasing connectedness of the world as a whole (ironic, I know!), where the average female is now able to gain access to a far larger pool of potential romantic partners. 
Why settle for a diploma graduate when you are receiving attention from degree holders? 
Why would you agree to go on a date using public transport, when you can get driven around by a car owner instead? 
Why date a 1.7m tall average-build man, when you can look up to a 1.85m tall muscular handsome man?
That’s the thing, it is ridiculous to not fish around and monkey-branch for better job opportunities, much like a potential offer from Janestreet/Blackrock and Google/Meta will always make you snub an offer even from Govtech. The same holds true for dating options, since a younger impressionable lady will quite literally be inundated with suitors. 
By no means am I calling for some social reform, or that women should lower their dating expectations and agree to go out with any Tom, Dick or Harry. I, along with my closest peers, believe, and are all working on ourselves, so that we may become better individuals, developing holistically.
But I can see my own privilege/opportunities/background. Education, finances, health, appearances, family, occupation wise, we are all above-average and stand a reasonable chance in terms of securing a healthy relationship.
I am willing and able to improve, because I can.
Not everyone is willing to, or even able to.
I can see primary school batch mates jailed for crimes.
I can see secondary school batch mates bouncing around from one dead-end job to another.
I can see JC batch mates grappling with body image problems.
I can see army batch mates struggle with communicating.
I can see university batch mates mired in financial issues.
I can see internship batch mates develop health complications.
I can see my graduating class trapped in terrible jobs with low pay.
I can see colleagues manipulated in terrible familial relationships.
Notice how after you come to the end of the list, you naturally just think ‘I only want someone normal who made it through all of that. It is not too much to ask of, is it?’
This is considering that confounders such as car/house ownership, savings, investments, hobbies, etc are not even included.
As time goes on, the majority of men will have already been given up by the majority of women.
And at some point, these men will give up. 
It is not unreasonable to want to date the best possible man. 
I really have no idea how to solve this, since personally, I would probably struggle with settling down when there is almost always better candidates in your inbox.
It’s just unfortunate that the end result is huge amounts of unmatched individuals, both men and women. A large proportion of attached women will also feel like they settled for a backup option that is nowhere near their main choice, while a large proportion of attached men will feel trapped with an unsatisfiable partner. 
I don’t think the politicians have a way to sort this out either.
It’s funny, especially with the current affairs playing out like that. HAHA

In my early teen days, I was groomed and assaulted by my teacher. When the incident happened, all I knew was I felt terrorized in his presence. It wasn't until I was a few years older that I fully understood what he did to me. He would often bring me into a dark room under the pretense of speaking to me about my academics during lunch hours. To intimidate the heck of me so that I wouldn't dare to talk to anyone about it. Another occasion was during one of my exams, he deliberately tried to caress my chest (back then, tiny punchy chest) by reaching his hand through my chest and then pointing to the paper on the mistakes I made using his role as the supervising examiner. He would also insist on offering free private tuition, and when I declined, he would threaten me with my failing grades, that he would speak to my parent, etc. During the coaching session, he would pull my seat next to him and rest his hand next to my butt and press against it on the chair. There were many other events that have caused me so much trauma. 
I have never spoken to anyone about this, as it is a dark, traumatizing, and painful childhood for me. But looking back, I've realised how this has affected my current state of mind, that I find it challenging to have intimacy moment with the opposite gender and there are many trust issues that I need to overcome myself. Writing this, I could still recall the entire incident vividly with fear.. and realise that even with many years that have passed, I'm still profoundly affected and in pain. What should I do? How do I get past this.....

60884,107721,"Hi admin, do post this because I need urgent advice. Thanks.
There was this girl in my course that broke my relationship with my ex (I mean I do have some responsibility for not setting the appropriate boundaries). We hugged and kissed while I was still in the relationship, and after we broke up.
Only recently, she started to distance from me and started seeing other guys, who she claimed were normal friends to her.
What was alarming to me was that, she said that she wanted to hug and kiss me and claimed this was genuine, and yet said that she was not ready to commit into a relationship. Literally 10 mins ago from when I'm typing this, she told me to keep this myself in order to protect OUR image in school as we still had 2 more years. I don't know what I should do now, I defo got played hard.

Disgusting to impose what you think is right for society. Everyone is made differently.

60872,107696,"I am thinking of dating and trying the apps actually. I was looking at the profiles on my friend's app (showed my quite a lot of the profiles over a few weeks). 
I realised that most of the girls minimally drink socially. 
I never drank before and I have my reasons.
There were only 2 girls that explicitly said that they didn't drink in their profile and I wouldn't really swipe them right. 
Every single girl that I am liked or really liked (based on both pics and the profile description) almost always have drinking explicitly put in their profile. Also, it is really weird this is the case because I know sometimes girls don't write anything about drinking. 
Is there something I am attracted to that these girls have in common (obviously, other than drinking)? I cannot pinpoint anything :( 
Anyone have any idea?
Just wondering if majority of the girls are like that and if I am going to be single for the rest of my life.

60859,107678,"It's going to be a long story that I need to get off from my chest and pardon me from all my grammar in case there are any grammar police in the comments section.
I have been with my gf for 4 years since 2019 and there were many ups and downs between us. But today she decided to break up with me because of everything that happened and also because of her parents. Some back story - she has depression and I have been by her side in early 2019 and decided to get together with her because I really care for her. And there was once she attempted by overdosing and I went with her to the hospital and stayed overnight with her. Her parents didn't even came to visit her immediately and they only came the following morning with policeman and I was arrested and detained for 48 hours because her parents told the police that I was the cause of her to suicide. It took me 1 year to get her parents to really understand me and I have to endure things like can only sit at the balcony because I am forbidden to go into their living room, I cant use their toilet and have to run to the nearest toilet outside to use before running back to her house balcony. Everything was ok but in 2020 when my gf shared her dreams over dinner table with her mum and elder sister, she got shot down by saying she becoming an accountant will never be rich as an interior designer and that almost made her want to attempt again but it took me a while to calm her down while maintaining my cool in front of her parents. Side track her sister is an interior designer and she is always borrowing money from my gf which pisses me off because when my gf doesn't have enough to lend her, the sister would tell her mum and she will get scolded badly for being useless. Her sister is also married to an Ang Moh banker and stays in a bungalow, have 3 dogs and a helper and 1 son and the irony is she always have to borrow money. Another irony is her sister could stay overnight with her then bf and not give a shit about her mum and her sister could easily get away with not paying her university school fees and not get scolded by her parents, but I have to made sure I was a good guy before my gf could stay over at my house.
I hate her sister because she keeps telling my gf to find Ang Moh or find sugar daddy so she can have money, saying i am useless and not earning as much as her husband. And her mum keeps telling my gf to find someone around her age like her classmates and all, i am only slightly older than my gf who have graduated and in the workforce. All this overwhelming thoughts went into her mind and depressive state which one day in 2022 she decided to take a break from our relationship and dated someone else but she was not happy because the guy abused her, forcing her to do things against her will. Her mum did not want to help her break up, so I stepped in and told off the guy and her mum, and this incident cause her mum and dad to have bad impression of me. We have to hide our relationship moving forward and it appears to be very taxing for her and just today she said it to me and said her parents will never be accepting us and growing older, she feel that she wants to have her parents validation and blessings as compared to 4 years ago when she just wanted to heck care them. I don't get it, her parents don't even give her allowance, don't even pay for her medical bills when she see doctor and psychologists, don't even give her money and ask her to keep buying things from Shopee or buying food home, don't even care about her and only scold her for being useless when she can't lend her sister money, to date she have already lend her sister 3k. Even if she gets awards from school, the parents don't even bat an eyelid. Yet today she says she don't see a future in the relationship and wants to break up. I really don't know what to do now, as much as I hate her parents and want to bring her out from that shit hole, suddenly she drop me a bomb saying that.

60877,107702,"Relpy to #107669:
Being on the fence, I waited for someone to give a good response to your post but no one did. 
Some comments claimed that you ought to respect your traditions without actually explaining why. Some said without your ancestors there will be no you; but your existence alone is not so much an achievement on their part. It is just reproduction. Living organisms do this instinctually. You exist less because of the culture of your ancestors than because of their survival skills. 
The comments that at least made an attempt to respond to your question are those that claim that the knowledge of dialects enable you to connect (for material ends) with people who happen to speak them. I am confident that with English and Mandarin you'd be able to live a hundred years and never run out of paid work to do. Having the skills to communicate with the people of Chaoshan is as obscure a skill as any if you have no intention of visiting China in your lifetime. ""What if you have to visit Chaoshan?"" Well what if I have to visit Turkmenistan? My grandparents were born in Singapore and they died without visiting China even once. My parents have not visited China yet and haven't expressed the slightest interest in going there. I've been to Sichuan for relief efforts during the earthquake and Mandarin is perfectly intelligible to the natives. I haven't found a need to learn Teochew even though 3/4 of my grandparents were Teochew. My paternal grandfather insisted that my father spoke only English and insisted that I did the same. My parents became lawyers who ran their own firm. I don't think any of my grandparents regret that their children only spoke English.
Traditions have meaning because you give them meaning. The parts of your traditions that continue to be useful wouldn't be called ""traditions."" They would just be something you do because it is still the best way to solve a problem. It is only that which is no longer very useful that we call tradition. The hammer was invented in the Paleolithic Age (30,000 BCE) we don't call using hammers ""traditional."" We still use the compass so we don't call it traditional. Lanterns, on the other hand, are just about as useless as an ashtray on a motorbike. They are often a symbol of Chinese tradition. If tradition is a word that describes ""things that have ceased to be useful for humanity"" then why are you trying to find utility in tradition? 
You don't always have to get your kids to learn what has already been made obsolete in your own lifetime, leave alone theirs. I wouldn't ask my kids to learn COBOL even though that's what I learned 15 years ago at Caltech. It is still somewhat useful but it would be very irresponsible for me to make them do it. This is pretty much what traditions are—one set of people making another set of people do things that might not even be relevant for them now, least of all in the future. All this talk that you build a sense of identity by being immersed in your culture certainly doesn't sound like good resilience training. You don't waste time going through life trying to find a sense of identity especially when there are people counting on you to put food on the table.
If you want a comfortable life, being pragmatic is one of the more reliable ways of achieving it. Some people yearn intangibles and more power to them. More importantly live and let live.
My words of exhortation to certain people is please do not expect other people to embrace YOUR traditions. I doubt that among the billion Chinese people there haven't been at least a million people who believed that certain practices are hogwash. That million is part of the canon of Chinese culture as well. Arrogance is in thinking that the majority culture IS the entire culture. If this is what you think, you have inherited something far more nefarious that happens to also be an indelible part of Chinese culture—oppression.

60871,107695,"This is my series of misadventures I went back to school today to complete some errands but it was raining very heavily. Once I got off the bus, I tried to ran across the traffic light to SDE as I didn’t bring an umbrella, but I accidentally stomped into a puddle of water and my new airforce shoes and socks were all drenched. 
I was very hesitant whether to take off my shoes and socks as I did not bring an extra pair of slippers and I would have to walk barefoot around for the whole day, but eventually I just went ahead to remove my shoes and socks as it was getting increasingly uncomfortable for my feet as I was walking around school. But that was the worst mistake I have ever made. I had to leave my shoes at a random corner as I did not want to carry it around while I was going around, but I did not see it was near a slope that had soil water dripping down so when I came back, my white shoes were completely destroyed. But that wasn’t the worst, as I was walking around, people were all staring at me and someone accidentally stepped on my toes without even apologising, as a guy I was really very humiliated. 
As I was about to leave school, I went to the toilet as I was having a bad stomachache, but the scene at the male toilet really made me wanna cry, the floors were wet and dirty from people’s shoeprints from the rain and some of the cubicles had shit on the floor. I wanted to leave but I couldn’t hold much longer so I just went ahead, but when I wanted to sit down, I felt something underneath my foot and when I looked I actually stepped on what looks like a pile of mud or shit barefooted, I was so disgusted but there were no place for me to wash them so I had to finish my business and walk out of the toilet to wash my feet in the rain.
At this point, I was so done at the series of bad luck I could have within a few hours just because of the rain and my bad decision of going barefooted. My feet were so dirty and it was hurting so much from all the small rocks I accidentally stepped on. I just went to take my destroyed shoes and socks and just booked a grab to go home. What a miserable day and I just needed to get this off my chest.

60874,107698,"I’ve always felt like I’m disappointing my family. 
Firstly, I’m gay and I knew that since I was 10. I did tell my mom about it eventually because I couldn’t keep it in anymore. I’ve never lied to my parents because I’ve always felt so guilty lying about something so big my whole life. One day it got the better of me and I told my parents on new years. That was the first time we had a heart to heart conversation.
A little surprisingly, my mother was “okay” with me being gay but hoped I wasn’t. I thought it would was all fine and stuff. Despite it all I would never be able to talk to her about stuff because I get all nervous and anxious about it. And when I do, she would shut me up telling me not to talk about it. 
A year later, I was outed by my mom to my cousins, brother, god knows who knows now. And I can’t look at my family the same way I could in the past. I love my mother and I can’t bear to “hate” her for what she did. I’m so heartbroken for what happened and this was last year. All events happened a few years ago.
Last year, I met a guy who “caught feelings” for me. At first I was really surprised and didn’t want to start a relationship because I could never accept myself. When I wasn’t out, I believed that it wasn’t real. But slowly I decided to give it a try because I thought he was genuinely a nice guy. Turns out all along he was just experimenting with me and playing with my heart. I finally opened myself to try something and I was left heart broken in a matter of weeks. Currently, I have “PTSD” of even dating anyone. I’ve had a few people asking me out and I can’t bear the thought of saying yes. Till this day, I still think that everything is my fault. 
I don’t dare to tell my parents these feelings I have because I don’t want to burden them with more issues. I was a problematic baby when I was born, a problematic teen for being gay and now I feel so anxious all the time fearing I might disappoint someone again. This year, my body couldn’t handle it anymore and I just started breaking down out of no where and this is still going on till this day. I’ve secretly went to counselling from school but I just can’t get what I want to say out. I’ve said some things but never really all of it. My last session with her, I left smiling pretending everything was  fine. I haven’t seen her in a month. I’ve been making justifications and I think she also stopped texting me after asking for my dates thrice. I feel so bad I can’t even bear to text back.
I would really appreciate help on what to do because I’m so scared of getting help outside and I can’t bear to burden anyone with this issue.
