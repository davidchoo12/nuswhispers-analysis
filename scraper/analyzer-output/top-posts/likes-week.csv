61207,108390,"My wish is to be laid off by my tech company. Dog shit pay for the amount and quality of work, literally shipping software 100 times faster than their average employees and going through all the red tape bullshit. 
Example of bullshit that typically happens, team of 100+ will take a few years to bring a fork of some open source software to production. And then in the team, there will be 30+ useless CS fresh grads who cannot code to meet foreign worker quota. And all they do in the company is really obtaining those useless AWS certifications so they can hopefully land an interview with Jane Street or hop to the next higher paying job. And then 30+ useless product managers who are more useless than my hamster. And then probably another 20+ usless senior managers who still don't know shit after staying in the industry for so long and end up as senior manager due to how long they have stayed. And then the remaining 20+ cleaning up the mess of these people.
But my boss is great and don't want to ditch her by resigning. Keep telling her that her pay is shit and our team should just leave. Hope she quits soon.

61209,108396,"I'm in a dilemma. I have a friend who is nice, amiable, friendly and generally a good-natured person that people are okay with. He is also very brother to me, and trusts me too. The only problem that has started to really bother me is that he physically cheats on his gf almost every other week. He goes to lupsup KTVs, the hostesses there often throw themselves at him (he's conventionally attractive), and he always reciprocates, some nights even sending them back home - only God knows what he really does there. 
I don't personally know his gf, that's why I never really felt it was my place to say anything. Once, I casually inquired if they were doing okay, and he always says they're doing fine and that she's super stable, not toxic, doesn't pick fights with him etc. This then made me pity his gf more, because I thought maybe if he was at least really upset with his gf, it'd make his behaviour a little more excusable (as his close friend ok). In fact, their relationship is not rocky at all, they are very stable, had BTO-ed, and he posts her very often on his Instagram etc.
At first, I didn't think they were going to last long because he always spoke about her as if she was a very convenient ""place-holder"" kind of gf, loves him more than he does, not his usual type, she chased him first, kind of way. So these were factors that made me believe I should mind my own business and let things naturally fall apart when they should. After all, he's my good friend right? I ain't no snitch. BUT, I started feeling uncomfortable when he told us he had proposed to her, WHILE we were at the KTV, with a hostess in his arms LOL. I just really really pity the gf so much, because she's so so clueless about what he does during nights he's without her. 
I started wondering why the hell does she not go through his phone like usual gfs do, or check his grab/gojek history once in awhile, or get location-tracking apps together etc. It would at least deter him from thinking she's way too easy to cheat on ma, right? Lesser tendency to want to cheat, knowing he would have to take extra steps etc. It's just a very sad situation... she seems like a very nice introverted yet bubbly girl too. She is unknowingly going to marry someone that does not even truly love her. And is probably giving her STD/STIs. I hope she gets herself checked one day.
I'm sure he does like her for him to stay with her for this long, and thinks she's wifey-material etc, but let's all agree he's definitely not in love with her. Hahahaha. What would you guys do? Would yall snitch on your bro or just let the poor girl (who you don't personally know) live her life out naturally in (fake) bliss?

61205,108384,"Goodbye my love. We have officially ceased to exist as a couple since it felt like a long period of break. In my absence, you have gotten to know and love someone from your cell group. I don’t know how to feel about it when I know the news from you. It felt comforting to know someone is there to look after you for the next phase of your life. However, it is also regretful that it is not me. Just like that, more than 10 years of our lives zoomed past since I held your hands.
I will not say that I have been a good partner but I am going to try to be a better person from 2024 onwards. I don’t think I can bring myself to congratulate you on your big day - I hope you will be happy with your decision.

61214,108410,"Hi Admin, deeply appreciate if you can post my story up. I'm in my late 20s & graduated from uni recently. My dad has always been borrowing money (from part time jobs I've saved) from me even while I was in uni working. He'd never paid for my uni fees. I paid on my own. Those money loan from me were never returned as he promised he would. I lost trust towards him since then.
Now as I graduated, he said he's old and wants me to take over his car mortgage payment which I have 0% ownership in. He doesn't wants to pay anymore but expect me to pay $3,200 monthly. I told him to sell, but he refuses as he wants to portray he has the ""ability"" infront of his friends.
I know, fillial piety is indeed a must as I'm grateful he brought me up. But I am barely surviving with my current salary and I don't have much savings. I'm ok to give him expenses but not ok to pay for his liability which he assured he would pay for it. He's being so irresponsible now. 
When I didn't nod my head to lend him money, he told his friends his child is so calculative now need help also don't want to help him out.
I'm pretty torn apart mentally. I'd love to help if I have tons of millions of dollars but I have my own future marriage, home, and own liabilities as well. 
Could any kind soul please advise me on this? Thank you.

However, as time goes by, I find some habits/thoughts really strange. Not sure if I should be more accepting to my partner and not judge. So I'm posting here to get genuine feedback. Along the years, I experience reoccurring things that has bothered me:
1. Often say to me: My mother do this for me, why can't you? 
2. Usually do not bathe before going to work. Reason being everytime, bathing would take at least 1 hour. May choose to only wash hair and nothing else for several days, with no soap applied to the body. 
3. Fear to get disease just from sharing food or saliva from friends/strangers.
4. Extremely dependent and sometimes I am required to spoonfeed information that can be easily found on Google without trying first.
5. Family has history of mental illness, but has not share what exactly to me yet.
6. Have fear of red droplets or red stains as they may be blood and think that it can spread incurable disease by going near it.

61208,108394,"Thought I could share this funny pickup attempt I encountered last week…
Was walking through the HDB blocks on my way to the MRT station, and this guy stopped me and said with an exaggerated enthusiasm “Hey! You are the cutest girl I’ve seen since I left house today! Do you live around here?”
I politely lied and said no, and that I was just running an errand nearby. 
He pointed to the direction he came from and said “Oh I live in the block behind… Maybe we can meet up someday for a meal?”
It was 9.30am in the morning… there wasn’t many ppl walking around other than some old aunties on the way to the wet market. So I wonder who he actually compared with when he said the first line, but okay thanks…

When should I contemplate leaving my current company, given that my manager struggles with accepting criticism and responds defensively when I express concerns about initiatives he's launched? 
I'm new to the team, while my manager has been here for nearly a decade, seemingly not contributing significantly but excelling in delegation and possessing strong people skills that likely earned him the role of regional lead. Is this a potential red flag for the company, or should I overlook it as long as promotions are on the horizon?
Im a fresh grad and I don't know how to handle this...

61211,108399,"Intrusive thoughts and how to cope with them
I am and have been coping with very intrusive thoughts for a very long time now and I'm hoping to find a solution before things escalate out of hands. Unfortunately, therapy is out of question due to reasons I will point out in this post.
I am in my late 20s and come from a rather privileged background - I have been working for my father in an investment firm. While my job is quite stressful, I have several sources of resources that make my life quite manageable. Unfortunately, I was raised in an environment where money, status, and, image matters above everything. To some extent, this upbringing has moulded me to be who I am today - I am not faulting my upbringing completely but it is not entirely faultless.
I live in my own apartment that was paid for by my family when I suggested that living together in the family house was getting to suppressing and I needed my own space. I have a PA that does most of the leg work and procurement of things I need, things I do, and places I go to. I take good care of my health and don't drink or smoke - much to the chagrin of my pals. I am attached with a girlfriend but she doesn't seem to bring much joy or purpose in my life, we meet twice a week and do regular couple stuff. She is a little upset that I don't ask her to move in with me but I have laid the ground rules very early on in our relationship that my private sanctum is absolutely crucial to me. Our sex life is nothing to write home about, I usually go through the motions as I find it void of passion and it doesn't terribly bring excitement.
What brings excitement and joy to me are my intrusive thoughts and some of which i regularly give in to and act upon. I find extreme pleasure in dominance and deliverance of pain, and I exercise this in the form of paid escorts. There are services that I can do with next to no need of holding back and I can, to put in crudely, do anything I want to these women and men. I am able to slap, choke, and basically deliver pain with consent and my orgasms are extremely gratifying. I am never able to feel such pleasures with my girlfriend and this was my personal brand of heroin for some time.
After a while, it started to wane as I somehow realised that it was staged to some extent and I'm just lying to myself that I am in control. Not long after, I found a new addiction - drawing blood from strangers. I was invited to play football and basketball by an acquaintance of mine - I would normally never partake in such activities as it involved getting physical with commoners( I apologise for this - I was brought up not fraternise with the common folks). However, I need a specific watch which I am unable to purchase and this wankstain guy has it - I needed to entertain him to get him to sell it to me. It was then when I realised I could essentially 'accidentally' elbow a guy right in his nose drawing blood! I would simply offer to pay his medical bills which was usually a mere couple of hundreds - bloody amazing!
I had to rotate between different groups of different sports to not draw attention but I am pretty good at it I believe. After doing so, I would meet my girlfriend or an escort and it would be a heavenly sexual experience. It has been my addiction for a while now.
I have other intrusive thoughts such as wondering how would the 'cocky finance bros who laughably think their Rolexes and Beemers elevate their standing' would feel if I were to bend them over and brutally destroy them from behind, making them feel like they are being broken in half. At times, I get annoyed by the geriatric employees who seem to be extremely backward in their thinking and traditional beliefs. I have intrusive thoughts that make me wonder if they would expire if I am able to deliver a punch to their sternum.
I am worried that these intrusive thoughts take over me and get me into depths of hell that I will never be able to get out of.
I acknowledge I am addicted to pain and suffering but I know, on some levels, this is not right. How do I address this? If knowledge of visiting a therapist in make known to my family or social circle, my life is essentially over.

At NUS, one of the RCs that encourage Community Engagement.
It is irony that the acad staff in charge of the programme always behave in a way that doesn't engage community, especially internally to staff/students - aloof, ignore others, over demanding, self centered.
Just ranting only because nothing can be done as the person holds power.
