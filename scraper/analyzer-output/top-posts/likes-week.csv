60674,107342,"I just wanna rant. I hate TikTok because it ruins relationships especially within a family. Ever since my mom got addicted to TikTok she stopped doing normal daily tasks like turning on the light at night. When I come home from work around 7+pm she will be sitting on the sofa in the dark watching TikTok. She doesn't want to cook even though she's the most free, because she needs to keep up with TikTok. Sometimes she even skips meals because she can't be bothered to find food.
Even during dinners she watches TikTok. My dad once told her off because dinner times are usually our only bonding time because we work in the day.
Not only that, why do people who watch TikTok have to blast it at max volume and replay the same video over and over and over again? I can hear it from across the house and it gets so annoying.
Put down the phone and communicate with the family. TikTok is like some drug and I hate it.

60675,107412,"I have been in a company for more than 5 years. This company is known for its extremely slow progression so I had not been promoted even once, but the reason I stayed so long was because the colleagues are generally nice. There is also no OT pay for staying back late.
Due to poor management, our turnover rate have been very high, with an average of 6 people resigning per year. Because of this, my workload had increased significantly compared to when i first joined, on top of taking a bit of side projects. Therefore, I'm thinking of requesting for a promotion.
However, here come the problem, I also have a couple of hard-core colleagues who not only took on high workload, but is willing to take on more side projects by staying back late almost everyday even without OT pay or bringing work home sometimes. I only stayed back late once in a blue moon to complete really urgent stuff as I believe in work-life balance.
Now my question is, generally for promotion, is it dependent solely on my contribution over the years or does promotion works like a bell curve, which is relative to how I compare against my colleagues? If it's the latter, does this mean I have no right to bring up promotion?
