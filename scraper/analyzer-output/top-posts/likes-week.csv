60971,107931,"So I am an ugly guy. People have said I am a 0 or even a -100 to my face and yes, this includes both gender. I am kind of low in terms of intellect. I barely scrape through things by putting my life and soul into studying my entire life. Most people can absorb things way faster than me. I somehow managed to graduate. 
I was bullied a lot in school because of how I looked and how stupid I was. 
Due to this, I talk very little, almost only if neccessary, and I have no friends till this day. I basically stay invisible where ever I go. I am actually quite scared of people, especially if they are really good looking or smart because they say the most hurtful things.
I have to work at least 3x harder than my colleagues to do the same thing at work. I am slower than everyonem People talk behind my back and I have accidentally seen their whatsapp messages about me. They dont outright bully me so at least I am happy about that. 
I met a colleague who was nice to me whenever we talked. She was kind so I really liked her. I helped her when she got stuck as she was new. She was really beautiful too. I thought maybe something good was going to happen, like maybe I get something good in my life after all the suffering. In the end, I found out that she got into a relationship with a handsome and rich guy. I felt I was pranked by heaven and so stupid to think that a beautiful girl would even like me. 
I tried dating apps and even some dating events. My requirement is basically anyone who can accept me. I dont care if the person is ugly, not smart or poor. I do wish the person is a little kind and doesnt hurt me. I got insulted and even gotten disgusted looks on events. Also, no swipes on apps unless it is a bot. 
I dont drink alcohol, gamble or participate in any vice activities. Contrary to what everyone thinks, I dont play computer games or even watch porn. I like painting - like on canvas, scultpures and other stuff. My painting skills suck but I like doing it because I feel at peace stroking the brush and there is no one there to hurt me.
I do get jealous when I see people my age having gf, wives, hanging out with friends or even just enjoying simple things like drinking together. 
I keep reading that everyone has a purpose on this earth. I really cannot think of anything for me. I am pretty much horrible at everything. I just wish I knew why I was even created.

60980,107953,"I have graduated from NUS for a number of years now. Most of my friends/peers are now married. I cannot help but fall into this toxic mentality when I look at their social media. Going on long holidays in faraway places, driving out for dates to fancy places, in their tiny long wallet and beautiful trendy get up, 3 bedroom condo as matrimonial house. And here I am eating cup noodles and vegetable rice with my boyfriend, bringing an umbrella in my bag wherever we go because we either walk or cycle to date places. I am envious, I want to dress up and look pretty and go to fancy places too. This makes me wonder what did I do wrong to not have that kind of cushy lifestyle? I am reasonably smart and beautiful. I am earning a decent salary now and can afford my own car and rental. Back in university days there were guys interested in me and I have been in relationships before. I know I shouldnt compare but I really can't help it. Am I expecting too much?

60975,107939,"Having good looks is a curse.
I know, npnt. 
I'm being told that I'm pretty all my life. I'm blessed with height and am also slim built with an ample bosom. Tbh, I don't see what others see in the mirror. I'm just me. I'm an introvert so I don't open up easily unless I've spent time knowing a person. I don't socialise a lot too. I always try to blend in but shit always seem to happen.
In pri and sec school I was bullied so much by other girls. When I reached the age when boys started to notice me, it got worse. I get prank calls from boys asking me to be their gf and their current gf would gang up with others to confront me and make my life hell. Once they even threw my school bag into the boys toilet, vandalized my desk, drew on my uniform. I was so afraid of going to school and couldn't focus in class. I dreaded being approached by anyone especially boys who wanted to get to know me. It's very uncomfortable when people keep staring at your chest instead of looking you in the eye when talking. I feel like a piece of meat. I mostly wear baggy clothes from then on.
When I thought those days were over, jc and uni aren't better. I thought I made some friends only to overhear them telling others they just wanted to know what's the fuss about me. Said I'm just some stupid flower pot plus other very mean and hurtful things about me. So basically they weren't really my friends. I started to keep to myself even more.
I finally entered the workforce and unknowingly dated a married man for a few months. I ended the relationship when I found out. He didn't wear a wedding ring so I assumed he's single. How stupid of me. I've also dated a guy who actually have a gf and I only discovered it much later. I was so broken after that. Whenever someone tried to ask me out again I just said no. I thought of trying dating apps but I fear it's worse.
All that talk about looks. Sometimes it's a curse for some people you know? You wonder if the person is really interested in getting to know you or is just desire or lust. 
I had a crush a guy recently and I think he noticed, he told me he finds me intimidating to be with. What does that even mean? How much of myself should I change to have a guy who is willing to look past my physical appearance and treat me like a normal person? I also want an authentic love with an authentic guy. 
From a heart broken girl.

60977,107944,"I became acquainted with FM over a decade ago while we were both students. Our close friendship blossomed due to the nature of our program, leading us to spend a significant amount of time together. We shared our hobbies, discussed life plans, perspectives on the world, and much more. Meeting for meals and spending weekends together became routine, often just the two of us, with little or no interaction and knowledge of others around us.
I held a postive feeling for her, yet our relationship never crossed into romantic territory, and there was no trace of ambiguity. Could it be that we were simply pure friends with no romantic chemistry? Was it because of our differing backgrounds and varying aspirations and expectations for life partners? I never had the opportunity to directly ask her if she felt the same. However, I vividly remember a humorous incident where I played the role of an advisor to help her get closer to a boy she liked.
Graduation eventually arrived, causing our lives to drift apart gradually. We pursued our separate careers, got married, and started families. With each milestone, our distance grew wider. Before I knew it, years had passed since we last communicated.
Recently, I received the shocking news of her passing. I was left in a state of stunned disbelief, unsure of how to react.
The loss of someone who used to be so close to me left me deeply saddened, yet I found myself unable to shed tears. I regret not staying in touch with her as much as I could have, and now, there's no chance to amend that.
I was taken aback by the fragility of life and how everything that seemed perfect could be abruptly taken away by nature, often with little warning. However, I realize there's nothing I can do to change this reality.
These emotions have become a heavy burden on my chest, and I'm unable to express them. Perhaps sharing anonymously is the only way.
I implore you to cherish those around you while you still can. For those who are on your mind but not by your side, reach out to them now and maintain contact as much as possible. For those you hold grudges against, try to let go and forgive.
Life is fleeting, and if you're fortunate, you may reach your 80s. There's not much time to wait for someone else to pick up the phone, to hesitate about making the first move, or to guess instead of asking for answers.

60974,107938,"Ignore the last aspect to this : say if I dress up as a police officer and walk around the streets and let's say a robbery happened right in front of me, and people around told me to act on it, I'll just tell them ""Oh I'm not a real police. Just dressing up like one"". 
Ignoring the law aspect on this : If I dress up as a McDonald's worker and go to McDonald, customers there may assume I'm a worker and asked for help, or workers there may assume I'm new there, but I'll just tell them ""Oh I don't work here. Just dress up like one"".
So same goes for if you dress up like a wh*re, then people will look at you and probably treat you like a wh*re , regardless if you're actually a wh*re or not. 
My point is, people actually do judge the book by its cover. People will automatically look at you a certain way, and treat you a certain way, if you dress a certain way. 
So stop with the whole ""Just because dress/look like X doesn't mean I am Y"" kind of argument. Just accept the reality of life. 
The faster you learn and accept this, the better your life is. There's nothing you can do. Just accept it. It'll save your life.

60970,107929,"AITA? Do I really deserve this treatment?
I hope you all can help me understand. It's a long one, but I appreciate it if you read till the end.  Will do my best to keep it as short as I can. 
I used to be close to this person (I'll call her Manda for reference) and she was one of my close friend for years. Not sure if it's important, but, I'm a guy. And no, Manda is not my crush, or gf, or more. Just a very close friend, pure platonic.
In 2016, Manda excitingly told me a great news about her studying in the UK. Thing is, I was excited, but, at that time when she told me, lots of bad things happened to me. My university struggles, my toxic family problems, financial issues, and my pet nearly passed away and I struggled to find the money to bring my pet to the vet, etc. So my response towards her news isn't exactly the best, but, I didn't react that bad. All I said was ""That's really great"". She tried to keep the excitement, to which I responded ""That's good"". I then told her ""Listen, I'm happy for you, I really am, but, I need some time alone for a bit. So much bad things going on with me now.. I'm sorry. I hope you understand..I am happy for you, but, I'll get back to you about this as soon as I can"". She didn't reply after that. 
Days, turned to weeks, everytime I texted her about her day, or anything to do with her studies, she gave me the cold shoulder. She responded harshly and sarcastically. Mind you that I don't understand social cues as fast as anyone. But when I noticed the passive-aggressive response, I asked her, ""Did I do anything wrong?"" to which she said ""Oh. Refer back to the text when I told you the great news of me going to the UK"". So I did and... I still don't see anything wrong really. 
She then said ""I was so excited to tell you the news, you were the first one I told,  and yet, that's your response? You were being rude and you hurt me a lot."" I'm still...confused. I then asked her ""Just because of that? I mean...why didn't you tell me before? It's a small thing, we could've talk...I did told you bad things were happening to me, but, I didn't say I wasn't happy for you though"". She then generally just lash out on me. Saying I'm not a good friend, saying that I'm a horrible person.
I begged her to meet up, or at least talk to me about this, but she refused. There's still many bad things happening to me that time and I don't understand why she wants to add more...she doesn't even bother asking me what I was going through...yet, I apologized to her, I said its my fault, I was begging so hard, but she decided to ignore me all the way. She decided to cut me off. Months passed, and she still ignores me. 
The day comes when she's gonna fly to the UK, and I found out one of her bestfriend couldn't make it, which made Manda sad. I contacted her bestfriend and planned on something crazy, to which her bestfriend agreed. That day, in the morning, I drove all the way to Melaka, Malaysia, picked Manda's bestfriend up, and drove all the way back to Singapore. At the airport, I was scared to see Manda cause of the tension we had. Right before her flight, everyone gathered (but not me, I was a lil hidden while keeping distance), and Manda was so surprised to see her bestfriend present that day. Her bestfriend said ""Oh, it's all thanks to him (me). He drove all the way to pick me up so I could see you"". Manda...didn't say a word about it. She saw me, but she didn't bother saying hello or...anything...not even a smile. She was just with everyone else. Hours later, she flew to the UK. I didn't get to say goodbye... I then send Manda's bestfriend back to Melaka, and drove all the way back to Singapore.
Days later, Manda blocked me everywhere, and I found out she had been bad mouthing me to everyone. No one believed her description about how bad I am to her, but still...why would she do that...I cried and cried for months, wondering what exactly did I do so bad...
7 years passed, her bestfriend got married recently, and invited me. I went in the wedding hall, and...I saw Manda. She saw me, rolled her eyes, and walked to a different direction. I immediately just leave a gift for her bestfriend, took one photo, and walked away from the hall. I didn't eat anything there. As I reached home, I cried till my heart feels like stopping. 
What exactly do I do wrong...please be honest with me...do I deserve to be punished this way...I have apologized, I even tried to make it up to Manda by driving all the way to pick her bestfriend up to see her on her day to fly to the UK...is that effort not enough? In the past, Manda can hurt me so much, but I always forgive her and give her the chance to talk...why is it when I do it one time, I'm the bad guy? 
If you read all the way, thank you for your time. Please do tell me if I'm the one who messed up..please let me learn..

Either way, I only want to be in one where I feel valued and proud to claim my rightful place.
He asserts being with his gf makes him feel like a 10/10, while I make him feel like a 2/10 (Btw I only know about him in a rs midway into knowing him). Imo, it is not my job to make him a 10/10 or a 2/10, because a person's intrinsic value is what makes the number. 
I can be with a man who is a 2/10 or a man who is a 10/10, but no matter what value people label him, I chose him because he is a 10/10 in my eye, and even if he is not, I know that I can make up for the rest of it.

But most of all, even if the event doesn't happened, some of it are simply general traits of an event.
