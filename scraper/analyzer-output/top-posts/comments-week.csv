61235,108751,"Imagine if you are hiring manager at a certain private enterprise, will you recognise a candidate's experience if you see that he/ she was a public or civil servant or uniformed personnel at his/ her previous job?
For example, if you are a hiring manager at an aviation MRO company, will you recognise the experience of an applicant who served as an engineer in the Air Force or with the likes of DSTA in his/ her previous job?
Or conversely will an experience in the public or civil service or uniformed service be a demerit point to hire that candidate, knowing that his/ her experience are not exactly ""real world"" profit making experience.

61234,108722,"Hi! I am currently working as a research assistant at NUS and I am considering my options for the future. I have been working at NUS for 3 years but would like to pivot to a career in data analytics/science instead. I have been offered a Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics at NUS, but I am also considering applying for the Online Master's in Analytics at Georgia Tech. I am seeking advice here as I am unsure whether I should accept the offer from NUS. Please note that the master's programs will be self-funded, with the NUS course costing over 50k and the Georgia Tech course costing over 15k. 
Thank you!
