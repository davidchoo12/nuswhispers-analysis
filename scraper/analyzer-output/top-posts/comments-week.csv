61232,108677,"I am horrified at many critical whispers on the embedded engineering career in the last months.
I have been offered an embedded position that is due to start after my final exams are over. I was told I will be working primarily on firmware with an occasional board layout design if required. The pay is at the median for an EE fresh grad.
Can I have an candid assessment on the prospects of this line of work? 
I hope people who have actual industry experience in embedded or engineering line can contribute their honest feedback.
