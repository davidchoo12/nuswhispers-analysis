61222,108480,"Hi Prof Ben, is it ok to be a CS student and not be keen in Machine Learning or Data Science?
Everyone around me seems to be gunning for related modules and seniors are all applying for jobs in those. 
My interests are closer to networking and computer graphics. But everyone tells me those areas have poor prospects. Both Infrastructure and Game Dev jobs don't pay well with long hours.
Should I just follow the crowd?
