60382,106674,"I am in the 3rd year of a relationship with a girl from architecture.
Since the beginning of the relationship, we have gone dutch on most of our dates except special occasions, which she insisted on paying for everything.
But in the past few months, she has insisted to pay for every date we go on. this makes me rather uncomfortable as i feel as a man, i should be paying.
However, she said she has no problem paying, and even offered me a monthly pocket money to spend on myself.
I am not sure if we are in a healthy relationship as i feel she is wearing the pants and i am of a lesser man.
Thinking about this, I am crying while typing this, should I end the relationship?

60384,106677,"As an exchange student from an Asian country, I am finding certain things absolutely intolerable over here.
First, I cannot comprehend why there are so many traffic lights installed on the roads. I can find one littered literally every 100 m, especially near neighbourhood areas.
Does this really help in the reduction of accident rates? What is worse is that not many people uses them, hence it is kinda inefficient for people who are in a rush.
Secondly, it is extremely difficult to find a rubbish bin over here, especially near MRT stations and I do not understand WHY??? After drinking, I have to look around like a clown for a disposal bin to chuck my used beverage. Even those disposal bins are located at non-sheltered areas. What do you expect me to do when it rains? Throw it over like a basketball?
These are the 2 things that are seriously annoying. Other than that, SG people tend to be friendly, quite contented and tolerant, which is surprising.

60378,106669,"Is life really better in the 80s/ early 90s in sg?
I saw many old pics of sg during that period but couldn't tell how life was life was back then as an average singaporean. Most of what I heard were from my parents and older relatives.
Cost of living was lower but so were salaries. Many in the workforce did not even have a diploma. Stuff like vacations and domestic helpers were luxuries. Mcdonalds and KFC meals were special treats.
Most flats were smaller and some families had 6-7 ppl cramping in a 2/3 room flat.
Taking photos were a big thing and videos were almost non-existent. Even so, most families dont own a camera. Unlike now where you can take hundreds of photos and videos on a single outing.
No netflix and youtube so you had to accept wtv was fed to you on tv.
No internet and mobile phones. School projects meant days and weeks of digging books in the library. No google and online reviews so finding a product or service was based on hearsay and referrals. No whatsapp and video calls so if you had someone who lived overseas, that once a week phone call was the only way of connecting with him. Buying stuff overseas was next to impossible unless you or someone flies there.
But they did say life was simpler, less stressful and everyone was much friendlier despite not having much.

60390,106695,"Hi everyone, I am an NUS year 1 student, and also an NS GF. I am facing some issues as an NS GF and would like to get some advice from the public, especially from people of NUSWhispers since I have seen several NS stories on this platform. During the past 1 year, my BF has barely initiated calling me while he was in the army and I had eventually grown tired of always initiating it. His reasons were always that he was tired, busy, or whatever it could be, but I could catch him sometimes online on gaming platforms. I understand that calling everyday could be very uneventful or dreading for him as I feel that he has nothing to talk to me about, but I hope that he’d at least try to call me once a week if he wasn’t so tired. I asked some of my NS GF gals in one of my module and they told me that they often have conversations at night with their boyfriend, event if it was just for 5 minutes. My BF would also share his army stories with me when he books out and occasionally tells me stories through text if it was interesting enough for him to rush to share the story. However, despite appreciating that he is willing to share his stories with me, he always utilise army slangs despite me having already told him probably more than 10 times that I hoped he could use simpler terms because I am not familiar with the slangs that he was using with me. As a result, I find myself constantly searching online for the slangs and even asking my guy friends in class about the meaning behind those slangs that he was using as he does not try to explain to me what the slang means. For a real life example, the slang “turn out”, when questioned, would be explained by him as “basically like just turning out lo”… I really hope people of this page could give me advice on what I should do with this situation and how I can better improve this tragic barrier between us. Thank you in advance everyone.

60388,106691,"My boyfriend wants more guy friends. Got his permission to share this so here goes. Basically he’s been in the arts stream throughout sec-JC and is currently in FASS. His past CCA was choir (he was the only guy in JC choir where we met) and his hobby is baking(the interest groups he’s joined in uni only had girls). In NS, he made only one close male friend. Apparently the rest of the section were the kind to go siamdiu/KTV every bookout so he and his buddy steered clear of that.
He’s the kind of person that’s quiet at the start but rly funny and playful when u know him. Due to most of the people around him being female throughout most of his life, he never got the chance to have that close group of brothers which I know he really wants. He’s in his final semester of uni and feeling a bit scared that he won’t have the chance to make more close male friends when he gets busy with work. Any advice on activities or groups he can join to make friends with other dudes?

Firstly it’s so hard to meet new people. My social circle is mostly attached people so they don’t have friends that they can introduce to me. (I’ve reached out and tried)
Second, ghosting is so common nowadays. I’ve never been ghosted until late last year and the feeling really sucks. Especially after you meet the person in real life. And it’s not really a stranger cos you have been texting for 2 months before meeting.
Third, I’m too picky. I have a specific type and that’s people who wear spectacles who are cute. That narrows my options significantly. I’m constantly trying to broaden my search but I’m afraid I won’t be as into them as they are to me.
Lastly, I’ve never been in a rs despite being mid-20s. Have been busy life and didn’t think about getting attached. And the only person that says I’m handsome is my mum, my sis said I was ugly. But I already knew that bro

I just grad from nus cs, but gpa is really bad, 3.4/5, and searching for jobs now. A few of the applications asked for gpa, which I feel that it is no pt applying to them since my gpa will automatically filter me out.
Should I still apply or just give up every application that asks for gpa, really demoralising for me. I do have a relevant internship, but it's just 1, and although it is an MNC, not those top companies like Google, Amazon etc. The skills required fits my profile, but I feel sad that my application will most likely be thrown away cos of my gpa, without a chance for interviews. There are so many applicants and alot of them must be fch right, how to compete.
What shld I do? Shld I just try to apply and give myself a false chance at hope?
Thanks so much. I'm feeling kind of down atm.

Throwback to two years ago, 23 years old, I never had a boyfriend. I am that kind of girl with pimples and oily skin. I deemed myself to be single.
Throwback to one year ago, 24 years old, I had my first boyfriend. A boyfriend who loves you for who you are, when he tells you you look better without makeup. A boyfriend who accompanies you ups and downs. However, as a ladies man, he was talking to other girls too. I was unable to accept it and the relationship fell apart.
Currently, I am in a loving relationship with my fiance. He is everything I wanted, smart, caring, generous and kind. Most importantly, treats you well, protects you and encourages you. What I want to say is don't lose hope. A failed relationship does not mean that you are doomed. Be at your very best, be yourself and you will attract the right one. No mind games, no forced convo, and everything just flows.

I never said I needed a partner to be my therapist. I said I was waiting for someone to understand me and accept me. I didn’t find any. And that was my learning.
I never said I’m still waiting. The point I was trying to get at is that we shouldn’t wait for ppl to bring us happiness, and should do other things to bring ourselves happiness. Learn to read the positivity in a message, will you? Also pls understand that different ppl have different priorities in life and just because ppl are different from you, it doesn’t mean they need fixing.
But freedom of speech ma. You can speak so I can also speak. You think I need therapy. Sure. I think you need some education too.
I looked you up. Seems like you are one of those mediocre who think you’re superior because you had less misery in your life, while in fact it’s the comfort you’ve always had that made you lazy. Good for you I guess.

60386,106683,"Hi Prof @Loy and Prof @Ben, I am reaching out to get some advice on how to ask professors for grad school recommendation letters. Please help me, as I genuinely have nobody reliable to ask and I don't dare to ask you in person... Maybe there are others out there who are struggling with this too and your response will also guide them??
1. Based on your understanding of the professors in your faculty, is there a way of asking for recommendation letters that increases the chances of them saying yes to me? Google tells me that I should send personal details like what I have done under them, my CV, even statements of purpose, etc, in the first email where I ask them if they would be comfortable writing me a strong recommendation letter. But that sounds like I am bombarding them info - am I wrong to think so? Would it be okay to send a short, 1st email to ask about their willingness and then another exchange a few months later to give them personal details when I have updated my CV with achievements that are currently upcoming but will become official by then, like conference presentations and journal publications?
2. Are there different yardsticks for what goes in the recommendation letter, when one applies to Masters programs vs PhD programs? Would I look bad if I tell my professors I would like to apply for both Masters and PhD, in case my PhD applications don't go through? How many schools/programs can I trouble a professor to send their letter to without them feeling like I am just shooting applications at admissions committees blindly? Is 8 or 10 too many, Masters and PhD programs combined?
Thank you profs very much!!!

60375,106665,"What is deal with this particular ex-classmate of mine? He is a compsci graduate and he did really poorly in NUS. That’s fine, you know, not everything in life is about studies, and you don’t need a good GPA to succeed in life, sure ok.
The thing is, he was always bitter about his time at NUS. He complains about the professors, the “toxicity” of his classmates, his exes etc. He remarked several times that NUS should burn to the ground, each time with a look of pure disgust. That’s very interesting that he said that, because that’s exactly the sort of remark I’d expect from a toxic person.
Bro, you can’t blame everyone and their dog for your failures ok. I do know for a fact that he was (and prob still is) an avid dota player back when we were still studying, something that he never fails to boast about. His amazing apm. That’s a really good use of your university time I guess.
I just don’t get how he doesn’t realise how he comes across to literally any listener. Like, are you listening to yourself speak? Do your understand how society judges someone who complains about everything in the world and finds no fault in oneself?
He is like that guy who played Hearthstone all the time in lectures and contributed nothing in projects (and also didn’t do very well) but at least this guy didn’t complain about everything, he accepted that he was a slob and he failed cos he didn’t put in the hours to improve himself. He had some self-awareness, so he can begin to do something about it if he wants to. To continue to play Hearthstone and get poor grades and pursue your other activities are totally ok, because it is his informed choice really. What’s not ok is the expectation that you should get a higher GPA/ better job without putting in the hours.
