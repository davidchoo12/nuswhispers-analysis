61233,108694,"I am in a rather tricky situation, and would appreciate useful advice
I have just started work (3 months ago) at this Company. During the interview, I told my interviewer (who is the head of my department), that I am taking a part-time course, lessons are twice a week after work hours. My office is located at a far end of the island, and it takes about two hours to travel to this IHL.
During the first semester, he did not have any problems in letting me go off slightly earlier so as to be on time for class. However, during this current semester, when I emailed to inform him, he replied with a question how I plan to compensate the company back for my earlier release, which totalled, only 2.5 hours / week. 
Abit of a background, my current company is the extremely stingy-type. Not only do they not spend any money on staff training, they do not even provide us with a laptop to work at the construction site. While at site, often, we need a laptop to be able to sync with the server. My head of department, who is disrespectful, dismissive, condescending, and antagonistic, said we need to write in with justifications as to why we need a laptop as already, the company provides a desktop for each of us. The only person who has a laptop in our department is the head of the department, and he is the one who does not need a laptop as he does not travel out to site. So, two of my colleagues spoilt the market by using their own laptop for work, instead of writing in to justify for a laptop (I suppose it is because they know the likely outcome). By using their own laptops for work at site, they run the risk of damage or loss through theft. A construction site is a very dusty environment, which can affect a laptop very negatively.
As it is, I am paying out of my own pocket for my night classes, which is related to my work nature. I do not plan to stay on long in this type of company which has little prospects, and with this type of boss. 
The thing I wish to ask for your advice, is how to deal with the compensation for earlier release.

61234,108722,"Hi! I am currently working as a research assistant at NUS and I am considering my options for the future. I have been working at NUS for 3 years but would like to pivot to a career in data analytics/science instead. I have been offered a Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics at NUS, but I am also considering applying for the Online Master's in Analytics at Georgia Tech. I am seeking advice here as I am unsure whether I should accept the offer from NUS. Please note that the master's programs will be self-funded, with the NUS course costing over 50k and the Georgia Tech course costing over 15k. 
Thank you!
