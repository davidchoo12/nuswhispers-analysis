After 6 months of dating, realizing that his height is actually 162cm instead of 172cm due to the insoles that he never failed to wear on every date, and now the both of you around same height, with you being 1-2cm taller.
Or, after 6 months of dating, realizing that her B cup is actually just somehow padded really well, and now even your chest muscles have more volume than her airport runway chest.

60815,107606,"I am in a rather new relationship , just a couple of months in , but we are often get into arguments almost every week. I think the issue is that i’m a more laid back person and my partner is super sensitive.
Our arguments always stem from my partner being angry at me for doing something wrong. Examples include like not saying goodnight, lack of emojis in our texts, all in all things that i have never thought would be a big deal. Worst thing is that when my partner gets angry , my partner would go silent on me for a couple of days without resolving the problem , and those few days are very agonizing for me.
I feel like i often refrain from expressing myself freely in hopes to not accidentally offend my partner , my friends and family mentioned that my partner might be on the more childish side, but my partner is older than me.
We are currently in the midst of an argument now and the silence from my partner is making me suffer.
What should i do ?

60797,107569,"TLDR: My gf hates my family and says and does mean things to them secretly, but I love her. What should I do?
My gf and I have been together for almost 4 years now. We are staying together in my family’s home. We grew up in completely different backgrounds so naturally we would have different upbringing. Before we got together, I had brought 2 very important points to her and that is my family is very important to me and if she can get along with them, it would mean the world to me. And if she can’t, I would really appreciate her being courteous towards them. I feel like my parents have been treating her so nicely and doesn’t disrespect her in any way because she is who I chose. But it has been almost 4 years and she hasn’t shown any basic respect at all (eg: greeting my parents when she sees them when we/she return home). And honestly to me, this is a huge disrespect. I had sat her down and talked about this so many times, but it just doesn’t seem to be working.
Recently she also confessed me out of guilt that she contaminates my parent’s food / drinks with my dog’s urine and that is freaking unhygienic and disgusting. I was too stunned to speak when she confessed. I didn’t know what to do or say at all… It has been a week and we haven’t talked yet. She keeps saying she’s very apologetic but I really do not know if I am able to get pass this. I honestly fear for my family’s safety if this continues because I don’t know what will happen in the future if she gets annoyed at them again… And as a cherry on top, she is living here rent free and does not help out in any chores at all.
I love her a lot and really wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, but after hearing her confession I really don’t know what to do or feel now.

60795,107567,"I feel kind of lost.
I am happy in my life in most aspect except dating.
Everytime I go after a girl in my life, I keep getting rejected.
The most recent made really question myself.
This girl was a 10/10 in my opinion. She was pretty, kind and had a nice personality.
However, within a few interactions, I realised that she had no interest in me. I mean I would ask about her and try to get to know her but she never really asked much about me and she seemed quite uninterested during our conversations.
I still maintained as friends with her. Slowly, we got closer and even she started to make jokes and seemed interested in talking with me. She also opened up to me more with her personal stuff more.
I was going through a rough patch with some family problems when she needed some help. I went out of my way to help her but I requested that she helped me with something else which she agreed to do so.
She never returned the favour and I felt hurt by it. I told her that I felt hurt and she said sorry but never actually returned the favour. Instead, she came back to me asking for more help. She also said that the time spent where explained that I felt hurt was a waste of time and she didnt even bother to try to understand why I felt hurt which made me feel sick.
She was spending time with her other friends going outing and stuff which made me feel really small and unworthy, as if I am a tissue paper.
I attribute the whole experience to a single point of failure. She wasn't attracted to me. To put it more bluntly, I wasn't attractive at all.
I really dont want to go through this at all again.
If I like a girl, I want to at least have a fighting chance at it, not be completely ignored like this. At least, she should want to date me to find out if we are compatible.
I want to be attractive.
The problem is I don't know what I am lacking or how to approach this.
I have things like studies figured out. For example, for Math, I just need to practice questions and for English, I just need to read a lot.
However, I dont know what I need to do for this.
If there is a method to do this, I would like to know. Are there any requirements to be attractive?
I want to be a 10/10 guy, nothing less than that.
Please help me and thank you from the bottom of my heart if you did.

60805,107585,"Is it a sampling issue or are people from not-so-wealthy families more spendthrift, tend to engage in a lot more hedonistic activities, and are much more arrogant than people from generationally wealthy families?
I have dated a total of 4 guys.
One was from a ultra-high net worth family. He was my first. I dated him the longest. His parents own one of the most famous food product companies in Southeast Asia. I met him at a friend's wedding. He had just come back from the US, graduated from Penn, in-line to take over the business as the oldest child. Due to differences in goals (he doesn't want kids period), we felt it was better if we parted ways. Apart from the kid issue, I would have married him.
He was an intense individual, very ambitious, very energetic, very calculating, very forward-looking, very pragmatic. He was also modest and thrifty. He loves eating at hawker centres (no air-con), he always wears his old PE shorts from high school, carries an old iPhone with a cracked screen, borrows suits to wear to weddings, buys cakes from Four Leaves to celebrate his parents' birthdays, never travels for leisure (only for work), takes the bus and MRT whenever he can etc. The only luxury he'd splurge on is air travel (he only flies SQ but economy). At 30 he already received all of his dad's holdings because they wanted to avoid the inheritance process to save on inconvenience. His parents are the same as he is—believed strongly in a world-class education, for which they were willing to spend an arm and a leg. Otherwise, their whole family pretty much lived by a similar philosophy.
The other three were pretty similar. Middle-class white-collar families. They themselves had white-collar office jobs—two were lawyers and one was a Morgan Stanley banker. They were partygoers. Traveled frequently for leisure. Ate at expensive restaurants. Went to concerts, even paying $1200 on one occasion for two tickets. Bought the latest phones, laptops, gadgets. The banker bought a BMW 3 series 2 years into his job. He also drank expensive spirits and wine. Once, one of them found out that I dated someone from a crazy rich family and he claimed that he was self-made and didn't have to live off daddy's money. All of whom were very eager to present themselves as upper-class, which was completely contrary to what I personally experienced being close to a centimillionaire family. I broke up with all three of them for similar reasons, I didn't enjoy what they did for fun and they kept putting pressure on me to do what they did. The common reason was ""[I] will not be young forever."" I concur, but I much prefer to focus on my work as I am saving up to buy rental properties to retire.
I have taken a break from dating because it is really frustrating that young people who refuse to participate in ""enjoying life"" are somehow treated like there's something wrong with us, when I am almost sure that it wasn't the case one or two generations ago. I'm still trying to make rent, I don't feel like I have enough money in my savings account for if I get laid off, I have student loans etc. I make good money (high 4-figure monthly) as an auditor. I don't think I'm comfortable enough financially to start traveling. But people expect me to. It makes me wonder if society in general think a certain lifestyle is how the ultra-rich tend to live without actually knowing how most of them actually live. Or is it the truth that the wealthy does spend their time in high-living and I just met a guy who was from an unconventional rich family?

60818,107609,"Dear Admin, please post this, as I really need an advice urgently.
Hi all, I have a big question regarding my decision to file it to the executive director or HR of my company, hence I need some suggestions from you guys. I’m a biomedical science researcher and have completed a BSc, a MSc, and a PhD in a local autonomous uni, and had 2 years of work experience. I had very little issues with my previous bosses, and I was even offered a new contract, which I rejected due to my pursuit of my PhD.
Never have I ever expect myself to fail a job probation, ever! Unfortunately, a few days ago my boss told me that I couldn’t meet his expectations, and hence he won’t let me pass my probation. Honestly speaking, as a scientist, I’ve done whatever he asked, and in fact I actually did more than what he expected, like trying out new solutions, thinking of new projects, troubleshooting, etc. I’ve also never once failed to update him whenever he asked for results. Hence, I honestly think this is an extremely unfair treatment to me, and I would like to file a complaint to the HR or executive director of my company.
The way I record my experimental results was one of his reasons to not pass my probation Since the day I joined, I have been doing all data recording based on my own format using powerpoint, excel, and word, which my previous bosses had no problem with at all. However, I was in a big shock when he only told me that my format doesn’t meet his preference at all after 4 freaking months, and demanded me to redo all my data recording according to his ridiculously strict formatting, which certainly takes plenty of time to do, considering the large amount of data accumulated over the past 4 months. I did try my best to do, but bear in mind that his format is ridiculously specific, and it’s not even meant for publication, presentation, conferences, seminars, these results are merely just to show him what I’ve done. Since then, every week he would approach me to complain about very minor issues here and there, and I did tell him that I’m trying my best, and on top of that, I still have to fulfull other duties at work. Imagine having to organize my data in all powerpoint, word, and excel files that I’ve accumulated for 4 months, it really wasn’t easy to do all within a short period of time. If he wasn’t satisfied with the way I record my data, shouldn’t he have told me from the start, instead of telling me after 4 freaking months?
Second was his bad science. I believe the reason why he hired me is due to my experience and expertise in this particular research field, but he refused to take my suggestions/advice positively. I have friends working in big pharma who are experts in this field and I’ve actually consulted them to discuss my ideas before I suggested them to my boss, but my boss always thinks he is right, and doesn’t give me the chance to suggest or execute my ideas as a scientist. To me, as a phd level scientist, I strongly think I should be given the freedom to come out with my own ideas and discuss with him, and be less micromanaged, but his style is totally opposite, where he plans everything on his own without discussing with me, and I can only do as he asked, which really makes me feel as if I’m just a research assistant rather than a postdoc/research fellow.
There was also once where something in our project plan actually went wrong, and he put the blame on me, though it was 100% his fault. All these while I have been trying my best to get the results out as soon as possible, but he asked me to do something else rather than focusing on my experiments, so when the results weren’t out on time, he blamed me for not being to deliver my results as scheduled.
There were also a few things that he asked me to do, and I did as he said, but during the confrontation with him, he said he asked me to do these stuff but I didn’t deliver. I then listed out the tasks that I actually did as he told, and he just brushed it off by saying “it’s okay, I’ve already made my decision anyway”.
What stunt me the most is that I soon found out that he is actually running out of funding as his grant application has failed, and the lab funding was worsened after the institute decided to cut funding, so in order to keep the lab going, he has to cut cost by laying off staff. Since I’m still on probation, he can actually leverage my probation to kick me out, just by simply saying that I can’t meet his expectations, which is actually not true.
What should I do? Should I just let him terminate me? Should I resign? Or should I file a complain to the company’s HR or director?
Thanks.

I have a crush on her from the start but i guess she didn’t catch it. Now we are both working adults, our texting context is usually her ranting to me about her work and some part and bits of her personal life. Did ask her out a few times but it only happen once or twice and was brush away with reasons like her working schedule changed or she got last min plan. Lately we still texts but her reply has been getting slower and slower to like one text a day. Did i missed the chance? Should i be thicked skin and give another shot?

60806,107587,"i often read stories abt couples breaking up for their BTO/EC, and lose up to 200k for EC.
i think it is stupid not to proceed with marriage. at MOP, EC typically earns 300-500K.
good location BTO as well also earn 300-500k. you buy at 600k, you sell at 1 million for BTO.
although BTO the penalty is much lesser - just abt 50k penalty after signing agreement for lease.
So If you already sign Agreement For Lease or BTO, or alr exercised the option for EC, then just go ahead with marriage, especially if you are young.
who knows if it might work.
if it doesnt work, in 7 years time you stand to get 300-500k in total. or each person 200k on average.
it is good to have multiple marriages also, it benefits and create employment for family lawyers.

60819,107611,"Ref #96185
I chanced upon your confession from 21 March 2021 regarding the pick-up culture of girls in Singapore. This surprised me. I did not know someone had asked this online before.
I hope you read this, despite being 2 years late.
You wrote: ""How is it still possible for guys who have lost faith in online dating to stand a chance to meet interesting girls that they randomly come across on the street? Or is it really a social stigma in Sg that random guy approaching a girl on the MRT is deemed a creep? Are there any effective solutions to this?""
You have met someone, mid-20s, who has done a good degree of all of that for 2 years now. Working at it for the past 2 years (since 2021) until today, and still pressing on.
My personal story cut very short is that I was persistently rejected by girls during compulsory education years, and short-changed of genuine interactions when signing up for Events. Problem with Events is that you cannot pick / choose who you pair with. Certain people there can socially judge you negatively for being some despo (and hungry) who just want to pick/date girls.
They make you feel bad for something you were genuinely shortchanged and then benchmark u as a social creep. These are toxic, socially over-privileged who don't know what's like to not have natural social advantage.
In other cases, signing for events/dating-events/CCAs do not guarantee your gender-balance and you end up wasting precious time trying to fit-into group decorum to which you never really signed up for.
I personally felt I was running out of years to get valuable practice and bucket list feelings/desires of just flirting and being playful around the opposite-gender in general.
You would have side-tangent your main purpose - which is to practice approaching girls of your desire, try to get them feeling comfortable around you and see if they're willing to stay in contact thereafter.
I decided to take things into my own hands and cut-away all of that unnecessary social-off-tangent. Those social settings dont work for me. Perhaps its coz I have my own line of thinking. I wanted for myself, a free space to test and explore my own thinking and what I really wanted to experience during my general interactions with girls.
I also wanted to stress-test what I could achieve, express and adjust when I interacted with girls. And find how exactly, I can reduce the likelihood of creeping them out over the course of my Work. And to also spend time reflecting on what kind of girls I need to let go - despite me trying and failing at hitting on them.
I never regretted. I had full autonomy on the exact type and looks of girls I caught-eye and wanted to hit on. This basic feeling should not be taken for granted.
The past 2 years consisted of me falling back on dormant legacy personality traits from young. For me, I had this thing about words and writing. Hence, I wrote cards of general message/encouragement and use it as a leverage to give it to a girl of my choice. You could append your number behind, or just a handle if you weren't keen enough to be so open. You can take creative direction and just adjust what you wanna say based on the season or place you are going to visit. Possibilities are endless and you feel real good just expressing yourself.
I tried many things. From just merely giving and not talking. To the more recent years of relying less on my card and really just speaking to test water. When my confidence grew, I allocated greater emotional strategy to Exit away from girls who replied to me in a very ignorant manner. Coz - abundance mindset.
For the good girls I experienced and successfully gave my card. You ofc hope they get back to you. However, whether a conversation does hold thru - still mirrors what you recounted. yourself.
From that point on, I opened my own exploring on what works, what doesn't work and most importantly - what lasts as a good impression.
This act on girls and cards also tested me regarding all various ways, permutation and setting I can best approach them. At times, making mistakes, feeling nervous and consequently creeping them out were inevitable. Nevertheless, thru the bad emotions I felt, I pressed on somehow to just find another way to do it - to also let go and self-talk against past emotional baggage that remind me that ""I'm creepy/despo to do all this.""
I encourage you to go out and try pick up girls in your best self in public places. You have to start somewhere and see which parts of your own personality are best tapped on when you vibe off to a girl you eye candied. You also get this priceless benefit to explore all these bucket-list excitements, emotions and flirt-desires before you really get too old to regret not doing them.
Its good to have your fill of these very impulsive stuff instead of answering society norm to ""feel to clean and decent in front of all girls in the Universe - that approaching/pursuing girls you don't know is condemned upon"".
The micro-thrills of some girl you hit on through your own effort - replying to your number, Tele or IG DM or beaming at your flirts/thoughtfulness etc - is priceless to experience. An important bucket list to experience enough of before you get too old to look appropriate for the Acts.
Find ""yourself"" whilst you look around outside. You have your own type and age range of girls. Take ownership and don't feel bad for having such a preference. So long as you stay respectful and genuine. Have nothing to hide.
I am personally still kicking my bucket list to talk up school girls/students as much as I can - if such suitable opportunities arise. It feels good to be young again.
The self-discovery journey is not guaranteed to be easy. I had my very testing and emotional moments in earlier periods of missing girls, lacking confidence, getting affected by social reminders and at worse cases, creeping girls out because they could already sense I'm present even before I do anything.
Advice for you - creeping girls out will be inevitable. Keep telling yourself that no guy is socially pitch-perfect to creep 0 girls in his entire life. Don't listen to any white-knighted guy who socially reminds you about (sexual) harassment and fear of accusation, and then links back to how ""you need to be a decent guy.""
These are people who gaslight what you truly want in your social energy and its your right to explore as much of it. Just know when to let go of some girl if she just looks at you so revoltingly.
Think statistically on ""Creep Rate"". You can't impress everyone. What you can best do is to work on confidence and timing such that you can REDUCE the likelihood of creepiness by making approaches as seamless, natural and clean (minimal hesitation) as possible. It will take time. You will not master it overnight. Neither does it stay consistent from girl to girl because you also may be sensitive and conscious about her unspoken vibe.
Once you have enough experience of picking-up girls. You will come to feel good that you have your own reserve and abundance of experiences to look back on. You will come to realise how some girls were just plain bs to hit on. Perhaps it was just looks and shallowness (and prob some lust) you approached them.
On the contrary - you may feel surprised to reflect on the other set of girls who left a good, sweet, gracious and decent impression on you - even if you didn't eventually get to date them and have since fallen out of conversation. It will guide you better on what exactly you are looking for in your ideal girl.
For me, I sort of had my rough image of that girl. My experiences have been slowly helping me confirm most of such vibes and features as what really counts. Very recently, I had personal encounters with (6-7)/10 girls (on looks) but proud of myself to have advanced on them because of their (8-9)/10 personality.
Sometimes also due to age gap, these girls are still maturing in look - but personality 100. I believe that they have potential to become even prettier in later years.
There is also a risk that some girl's boyfriend will reply you/confront you online regarding ""picking-up"" their girlfriend in the public place. You will need to know how to deal with it.
(1) pick your battles. You do not need to reply every boyfriend who messages you back. Some of these boyfriends may just be insecure pussy who just dont trust their girlfriend enough that she will be easily swayed to you.
(2) If you choose to reply that boyfriend, just tell them what you are doing and looking for. You got nothing to hide. But no need to be too nice. You dont owe them an apology. You hit on a girl (back then) to which you got no reason to believe she is attached. All you only did is just talk her up and give her your card. At most - just say sorry if the gf felt creeped out.
Different strokes work for different timings/environments. Not every setting you can afford talking a girl up. Sometimes, its just better to approach, say your small piece, give her your card and then walk away. Other times, it is better to spend time small talking her up or at least, just confessing your feelings and outright asking for her number.
You own your adjustments and flexibility. Versatility is all on you. There is so much more experience I could share with you but - it would be very lengthy.
For now, please just know that you got someone here supporting you in finding your true happiness, albeit it being socially deviant. Throw those peer pressure advice out the window! Listen to yourself.
Don't regret not doing enough when you are older and when your age is really way above that your own conscience cannot take it.
All the best!

In our field, some patients are (partly) naked due to their limited capacities/illnesses/procedures and the nurses have to physically handle them in their various degrees of undress. If they were regular old patients I wouldn't really care, but once in a while they have to go check or even adjust some young, fit guy's d*ck and it makes me feel weird and kinda jealous. Once I heard her talking with another nurse about if they needed to some procedure on a guy's genitals and I was so disturbed I just pretended I didn't hear them and quickly walked away. I mean I know it's just part of the job - and maybe even hypocritical of me to say as someone in healthcare myself - but I can't help but feel like nakedness is something sacred to be treasured and shared with a partner exclusively, but that some kind of innocence is lost here..

All my friends know this girl has a huge crush on me.and she has been trying to get my attention for ages. Actually I have no interest in her so I just tried to be polite whenever she talk to me. No flirting whatsoever. Just that the longer I see her, the more I thought why not just talk to her because we are in the same course and I find it hard to avoid her. She has never confessed so I just acted like I didn't know. But it was very obvious and our friends often teased her about it.
I never thought much about it as I wasn't seeing anyone at that time. Once a few of us organized a gathering and I had a few drinks. She came right up to me and tried to talk to me alone. Eventually she confessed that she liked me, I didn't know what reaction she wanted from me so I told her I only saw her as a friend. I was very sure of what I said but she just threw herself at me all of a sudden. I think the drinks took over and we kissed for a while.
Over the next few days she kept texting me, trying to make me officiate our relationship. I thought over it and apolgized to her. I really don't have those kind of feelings for her.
Actually I like someone else but that person has a bf but I don't think its anyone's business so I never told anyone.
Anyway back to this girl. Now she is accusing me of leading her on and taking advantage of her. I don't know what she told her friends but they all kept glaring at me like I'm some big sinner. My friends tell me to just ignore her. They all said I should have pushed her away but guys tend to lose out in these kind of situations so no point arguing with her. They joked that she took advantage of me instead.

Not because I'm upset but because I have no idea if my own mother is interested in me. I don't want to keep talking if she is not interested. It's fine. I can share those stories with my friends, even though she is my mum and I want her to know something about me. She knows nothing about me beyond 7 years old.
I don't blame her. Personally I feel having three kids is too much for her to handle. She is occupied with my older sister and my younger sis who are more accomplished. She simply doesn't have any spare attention or energy for me. Not that she doesn't want to.
Sigh. Not interested in me? Fine. But it's annoying when she starts saying things about me that are not true. For instance, telling her friends that I don't eat a certain food. Fuck bitch. I have been eating that in front of you my whole life. You just haven't been paying attention.
Sometimes i think that maybe I would be happier without my family. The lack of connection breaks my heart more than anything.
Anyone in a similar situation? How to make things better? As time goes by, my family becomes the last perosn I tell anything to. It's sad. I cannot express how lonely I feel. I know my family loves me but there is no understanding and no connection. No one knows anything about me at home. They remember nothing even if I told them. Being busy is one thing but if you don't ask and don't remember shit then that is just messed up. Also, I am always the last perosn to know things at home. They discuss with each other at their own time and one notices that I'm not being told. I don't think it's intentional. It's prolly just that there are too many people (?) . I'm married with kids. I told my husband that if we want kids, it must be even number.
How?

I only found a guy friend in year 1 and I thought that I can just stick to him and blend in to the crowd. The problem is he is extremely self absorbed. He thinks that he is very irresistible and all the girls are flocking towards him. there is only one super desperate girl expressing interest in him. The rest are just friends and most of the time, he is the one trying to attract attention.
The other day in the library I overheard him bragging to his friend about the number of girls he managed to attract in year 1. To my horror, he mentioned that I am one of those nutty girls going crazy over him. I felt so disgusted because I do not have any romantic feelings towards him and I am just trying to survive in school. I want to distance myself from him when semester starts but I will become a loner and it just sucks…
I wish I have a normal friend… Just one will do…

I'm looking at taking either the Graduate Certificate in Computing Foundations program or Master of Computing - General Track.
What is the difference between the 2 programs? The Mcomp program is so much more expensive and takes longer, would it be more cost efficient and quicker for me to just take the Grad Cert program so I can enter the IT industry faster.
Or should I just go for Bootcamps instead?

60800,107576,"At a certain age, you all need to grow up.
I posted this elsewhere before, but I'll post this here.
By the age of 25, you all should start thinking about what to do with your future. All those immature attitudes you have since school time should be gone by then. All those drama you purposely got yourself into cause you're so pathetically bored with your life, you should leave all of it at once by then.
25 is a great time to start thinking about what matters in life. To be responsible, discipline, mature, and of course, a grown adult.
I don't care enough if you achieve certain things late, like graduating, marriage, first car, first house, first child, like say by the age of 35+. But 25 is where everyone needs to start take their life seriously. No more childish behaviour. No more drama. No more irresponsible behaviour.
If by the time you reach 60 but your mentality is the same as when you were 20, then all you did was grow old, and didn't grow up.
Stop being such an inconvenience to everyone else with that childish, dumb, irresponsible attitude of yours, especially when you're a grown adult.
Grow up.

Just, stop pretending to know everything, coming from irrelevant sources. Just say you don't know. Seriously it's extremely pathetic seeing how much y'all crave attention from the public. Even dumber when the ones listening to your nonsense simply and blindly believes you.

60817,107608,"I graduated from CS many years back.
There is even a term for people like me, the dumping ground batch it seems based on the confessions I have read. I find that extremely derogatory as although I did not have perfect A-Level grades, I did decently and could have my choice of other courses. I had a strong passion for computers and programming since my younger days and so CS was my natural first choice.
I decided to post here for the first time after interacting with several junior SWEs both fresh grads from CS and mid-career transitioners. Most if not all chose this field because of the high pay.
When I ask if they have any side projects, most don't have any. In fact, most of their time was spent on Leetcode and brushing up their interview skills on the hunt for their next job hop and pay increment. Some even have the cheek to insinuate I'm old and outdated as I don't know and have no interest in the latest Data Science, AI, machine learning stuff which they learned in school and I did not. As if DS AI MR are the only fields of CS...
In my time, the people who chose CS came from either of 2 camps, you could not make it to other courses or you have very strong passion for this field. Camp 1 nothing to say. But for those in Camp 2 like me, we were really different. We were motivated by the love of our passion and hobbies, money while important was never our top consideration.
CS now seems like a a money making opportunity. Where is the passion now it seems?

When I close my eyes I can still smell his breath and feel his hands groping. He boasted of his many conquests, some of whom were VERY MUCH underaged (14 and 15 year olds.) while I heard stories from others, nobody ever dared to publicly name and shame.

60808,107594,"经历了人生一段刻骨铭心的爱情，我意识了几个观点想与大家分享：
1。 不要对自己过于的苛刻- 失败的恋情并不代表你是否值得人去珍惜，爱护。最重要的是你必须爱护好自己因为只有自己会与自己过完人生的最后一秒。绝对不要对不起自己。
2。不要太轻易的相信别人，就算那是你看好觉得你可以放开心房相信的人，这世界是没有绝对的事- 毕竟可能你想要传递的是自己的真心以及想法，但你信任的那个人可能会质疑你的目的并且觉得你是个很偏激的人。
3。每段失败的恋情都会有所失所得的收获- 失去的要拿得起放得下。这也会是你的所得。尽量不要往坏处想，多想想在这过程里，你是否更多的了解自己？自己的好与不好，让后在想你该做出什么样的改变所以事情不会从道负责。
4。 不要放弃- 人的一生，我们都不停的在学习，经历考验。把这失败重重的经历过程，都当做是在磨练自己成为更好的自己。 总有一天，你会遇到那个你不许多传达言语的那个人，也能理解，相信并且支持你。
这总结了我的收获。希望那些处在一样经历的人也能鼓励自己，有所领悟。
我也想对那个让我经历这样的经历的人说： 感谢你曾经来过，你教会了我许多。这段日子，我想开了，也会放开。对于你认为我会做出对你声誉有损的事，请你放心我绝对没有。感到可笑的事，我认为你会有这样的想法是因为你不断的在我背后抹黑我的名誉。算了我也不想与你计较。我也不会去打扰你现在平静的生活。希望你也能做到。这个空间我留给你发会，享受。我决定离开了，希望你在你众多的wife materials当中找到你理想，心意的。
保重。
