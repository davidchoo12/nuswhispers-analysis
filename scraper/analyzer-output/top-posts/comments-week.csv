60515,106933,"My advice to guys thinking of settling down and getting married - don't! You will regret it.
I too once thought I found the love of my life. That we will live happily ever after. I was so in love all the advice I've heard before fell on deaf ears. Don't repeat my mistakes!
Someone once told me that the biggest reason marriages fail is because women think that men will change after marriages but they don't. Men think that women wouldn't change, but they do.
And boy do they change... Within a few years, I can barely remember the woman I loved. And I'm not just talking appearance - it's the personality changes that scare me. Even her family commented that she is so different.
The once caring, gentle girl who was the light of my life is now my nightmare. Everything I do or don't do is wrong. Everything I say or don't say is wrong. Every wrong step she will dig up things from ages ago and stack them up.
Other than the 3 kids we have and love dearly, we are worse than roommates. Every time I thought we made progress, something trivial will trigger her and it's worse than ever.
So think twice, thrice, and 100 times before you jump the gun.

60512,106939,"What does it mean when he says he's ok if I date someone else, but he will feel a bit sian?
We've been dating for 6 months plus, our interactions and dates have been very fun and enjoyable. We always manage to talk through our disagreements in a cordial, calm, level-headed manner.
Bedroom play is fantastic and out-of-this-world too. We have a lot of chemistry in that area.
But he says he's unsure and also worried that he will hurt me. And he says he don't want to be possessive too. Someone told me that if the guy really loves you, he wouldn't want you to date another person.
What are your thoughts and perspectives? Should I move on and focus my energy and time on another potential?

60508,106928,"Should I bring up with my boyfriend because he homophobic?
I have a few closeted lgbtq+ friends and am also consider myself to an ally of the community. However, my boyfriend of two years isn't and he thinks it's unnatural. So much so that he sends me shorts with anti-Lgbtq rethoric. I feel really conflicted when he sends me things like that.
After talking with him to understand where he comes from, it just came down to that we have different viewpoints. I guess Im just seeking advice as to is it really worth sticking it out. I sort of rationalize it by telling myself that a lot of people in Sg are still pretty conservative.
I haven't told any of my other friends about his viewpoints. And honestly apart from this, I am really happy with him. And it only comes up occasionally. I guess I'm really just seeking advice, as to is this really something that one breaks up over? Can it change in the future?

60516,106931,"I saw this guy at the golf course twice. The second time when he came, I dropped a note on his car telling him he’s cute. After that day, I have not seen him anymore till date.
To you- this probably will lead to nowhere but I have been thinking about you. The way you smile and how you played golf the beginner way but still full of smiles. I don’t even know if you are seeing anymore or even married but I am just attracted to how you carry yourself. I hope to talk to you in person the next time I see you at the golf course.

60510,106932,"Feeling down at the moment, unsure of what to do
Feeling like an idiot, ppl around me are like career change, leetcoding, gg into tech for the good pay and future, spamming internships, while there is someone like me, looking to jump out and dk what to do even w a cs degree. Nobody I know thinks like me tbh, all came in liking tech and hv big dreams of contributing to the tech industry, seems like I'm the oddball
got into IT, anyhow chose the poly course, then went to NUS CS cos it sounds good??
then now, while ppl are getting good job offers, I was unemployed for a few mths and recently got a job as sch helpdesk, 3k plus. I'm fine w the pay, can survive can alrdy. I cannot do another whiteboard interview, really cannot. I literally cried and stayed in bed after my first coding interview, ik it's damn dramatic but I was really really stressed.
my only hobby throughout my life is art, but hey I hv bills to pay, and I'm not good enough atm to sell my art. Really enjoyed the unemployed days drawing but hv to wake up to reality, hobbies are hobbies, can't stay jobless forever right.
But idk how long I can fake interest in tech and work without thinking of ending my life and cry everyday. Should I just stay in tech for the future or idk...... numb myself and just pick up coding again for the money idk
Anyone here like me? Or I'm the only weirdo

60509,106930,"Never trust a fucking baldy who says that he’s trustable (no offense to bald people). But this A-grade asshole really deserves a special shitmeal because he is simply full of shit. I mean, the guy literally has the alphabets DICK in his name. Now for getting rid of snakes:
Snakes are a part of the world, and as such it is impossible to be completely rid of them unless you fortify yourself inside a solid bubble. The best you can do is keep your snake interactions at a minimum and keep any snakes as exposed as possible. Taking away the animal’s sense of security is part of the battle.
Next, how to trap snakes with a glue trap. Traps should be placed at vantage positions around the snake’s territory. Lure the snake inside through a specially designed opening. Once inside, the glue holds it firmly in place. What you do after is up to your own ethics. The downside is that you risk getting bitten.
So what would you do: avoid, expose or trap?
