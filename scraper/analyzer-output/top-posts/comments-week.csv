He asked me not to chat with him for the time being until he finishes all his exams and assignments, which is totally fine for me because I know those are more priority. However, on the day of his finals, his female colleague (married and pregnant) went for pregnancy check up and complained of stomachache, which caused her to be remained in the hospital for further checkup. She said she was stressed and crying, so my boyfriend put down his finals and went to accompany her. I got mad because in my mind, he was putting her as priority above his exams and me. I tried to explain to him why I am mad (her husband is on the way coming to see her, it's not really his responsibility about whatever happened to the colleague), but in turn, I was getting mad at and he said he was disappointed in me because I did not support him to be a good person who comforts other people in stressed up condition. I need some help here, as now I don't know anymore what is right or wrong.

I am a doctor working for the past 15 years at both the hospital and now GP clinic. After I graduated, as much as I want to uphold the oath in serving the sick, I find myself feeling despair for the general public as time goes by. Call me irresponsible but you do not know the effort I put into serving the community selflessly as long as I could. Every encounter with idiots and stupid people slowly chips away the drive and passion I once had to helping people out of their medical problems. Unfortunately they are not rare or uncommon. 30% is the rough estimate percentage of idiots I see daily. The most common type of idiots I see are liars. Other types include self-entitled, demanding, abusive, stubborn and etc. It made me come to a conclusion that this profession is meaningless. I do not see the reason in helping out idiots, I do not think they deserve it. They waste my time that I could have meaningfully spend on genuine patients. Simply search for any hospital or clinics in Google Maps, read the reviews and you will understand the public's attitude. I'm confident that I would not be the only one with this mentality. I give up. Good luck to humanity.

The guy who earns less than 4k a month.
I don't know you. But I've met men like you. I totally get why you made such sweeping statements about women. No one likes to be rejected. I can tell you one thing. Even men who make less than 4k a month can get women. But would you reject the women who want you? You probably won't even give these kind of women a second look as you deem them as not good enough for you. It's like you're a 5/10, wanting an 8/10 and looking down at any woman who is 4 to 6.
Everyone wants the best for themselves but what do you have that the 'best' must accept you?
I'm guessing from your post, not only you do not have money, you also don't have the looks, personality or intelligence to nab the type of women you're after. So what does that leave you? Focus on what you can work on. Calling women gold diggers because you are rejected just shows you haven't learnt much about women.
If a man have enough good points but don't make enough money, some women will be willing to stay around and work together with you. Trust me, you wouldn't want a woman who will be with you just because you can earn 20k a month. Just like all people who want to have a relationship, we want someone who is willing to be with us through thick and thin.
The only advantage you have is that men have almost no expiry date compared to women. You can be 40 and still date women from 20s to 40s while a woman of the same age have to settle for a smaller pool.
But above all, I still have faith that men like you would be able to find someone one day. She may not be your first choice, she may not be a perfect 10, but I can assure you, as long as you play your part as a decent person, lover, boyfriend or husband in this partnership and help each other blossom, she can become a perfect 10 in your eyes.

60554,107004,"Am I the Asshole for requesting the teaching team stick to the original rubrics causing a regrade and everyone else to score even lower?
Hi everyone,
I'm a student in a course that recently had an assessment graded. It soon became apparent that there were inconsistencies in the grading, with some students receiving higher scores than they should have based on the rubrics.
I raised my concerns with the teaching team and requested that they stick to the original rubrics for grading, even if it meant that some students would have to be regraded and potentially receive lower scores. I felt that it was important to maintain the integrity of the grading process and ensure that everyone was being assessed fairly.
The teaching team agreed with my request and implemented a regrade. Unfortunately, this will result in some students receiving even lower scores than before, which has caused some tension and upset within the cohort.
While I understand that this situation is not ideal, I still believe that it was the right thing to do. In my opinion, it's important to adhere to the rubrics and maintain consistency in the grading process. I would hate to see students receive grades that do not accurately reflect their performance simply because the grading was not done fairly.
Here's a snippet of the reasoning and context behind the regrade:
As we all know, the one rule intimated to us well before the PE1 exam was even announced was that ""If the submitted classes or any of the new files you have added cannot be compiled, 0 marks will be given. Make sure your program compiles by running 'javac -Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:rawtypes *.java' before submission."" The exam paper also stated the rule, as above. Consequently, one of the biggest challenges and achievement, in fact, for exam candidates was to just get their code to compile.
I hope this post is read in its spirit, not just by the instructors, and compiled scripts' students, but also by those who had uncompiled scripts, so they can understand the fundamental issue at play here.
I, as a student myself, understand and sympathize that this rule was a tough one and a scary one, but I brought myself to terms with it, and understood the rationale that as computing professionals, compiled code should the minimum prerequisite in a Practical Exam. In the mock PE, practice PEs, even in the real PE at the 80-minute mark, we are intimated to ""make our code compile"". Every CS2030S student knows that debugging and making your code compile, is in fact, the most challenging and time-consuming task. As tough and scary and strict this ""0 marks for uncompiled code"" rule was, it was a rule nevertheless, and one that influenced our very approach towards PE1. It was not a test to write well designed code that cannot compile, it was a test to write compiled code that is well designed. I feel very strongly that the grading for PE1 has been inconsistent, and frankly unfair to everyone who spent a large proportion of their time debugging and making sure that their code compiles when the clock hits 90 minutes.
I will get a lot of hate for this, and naturally, this is an anonymous post. I'd just like to reiterate what I said earlier, a tough rule is a rule nevertheless. All of us were intimated of the rule from Day 1, and we all know that going into the PE1, our core goal was to get it to compile at least. Those of us who decided to take the risk, ignoring and defying the IMPORTANT rule given in the question paper were rewarded, while others who stuck to the hard limits and gave it our all to produce compiled code, adhering to the given rule, were in a way penalized, albeit relatively. Just as an example, a student over conscious of the compilation rule (as all students should have been) would have spent 65 minutes getting to a point in his question where he has compilation errors, and would have spent the next 25 minutes debugging, and possibly also removing or reversing some of his changes (changes that were OOP and Design principled) just to produce compiled code. On the other hand, a more risk-taking student would have 65 minutes getting to the same point, and upon encountering compilation errors would have just carried on implementing the other tasks, thinking he can debug and compile in the last 5 minutes, which in fact he/she was unable to do. Assuming both students have the same content understanding and coding skills, based on the inconsistent and unfair grading practiced, the first student would receive a far lower grade than the second one in PE1. This is not a made-up example; this is a real and a common occurrence among my peers.
Why I feel this grading is unfair and inconsistent is because the most important rule of the PE1 was conveniently made flexible to sympathize with students who couldn't compile their code.
Firstly, the single biggest rule that formed the very base of our approach, our fear, and ultimately our marks was disregarded entirely, maybe based on the score statistics (a high number of students receiving 0). I'd like to reiterate that no adjustments to the grades for the uncompiled scripts were made, not even a penalty, the only differentiating factor in grading between an uncompiled and compiled script was ability to pass test cases, which we all know, can be just a "","" ""."", ""-"" away for a compiled script, meanwhile completely out of reach for an uncompiled script.
Secondly and a more minor argument, other strict rules which had a even higher impact on the grades of compiled scripts were not even stated clearly in the question paper or intimated to us before the exam. I am referring to the following rules:
- getting the 2 marks of encapsulation right to be able to get 6 other marks, making the portion worth effectively 8 marks. A compiled script student may have left the existing code for 1-2 tasks simply because he spent time debugging and compiling his code for the other tasks.
- deleting unused code, functions and private fields, boilerplate code which would have no impact on your running was also penalized. A compiled script student may have left some helper and debugging functions and not dared to change anything at the last moment given the time constraint and the compile rule.
My point about inconsistency is highlighted in the 2nd point above in that the examiners' rationale for awarding uncompiled scripts equal marks is going to be something along the lines of ""We understand it's extremely stressful to have your code error free in 90 minutes, and this class is about design principles, and we awarded marks on that basis"". On the other hand, students who had their code compiled may have made the choice to not mess up their code in the final minutes owing to the same time constraint and stressful environment but were penalized for it. The same 90-minute stressful environment induces different decisions for different students but the students who choose to follow the rules, stay conscious of the single biggest requirement of the exam are inadvertently penalized, once through the sheer awarding of marks to uncompiled script, and secondly through these other ""Strict"" rules that are only realistically enforceable for compiled scripts. I mean if the instructors somehow understand and sympathize so heavily that 90 minutes is not enough to produce compiled code, so much so, that they change the single biggest fundamental rule of the PE, they should also understand and sympathize that 90 minutes is not enough to remove boilerplate code and unused methods/fields from one's compiled code.
In the end of this post, I'd like to quote a few sentences from an earlier thread in the hope that they further illustrate and back this post.
""Now they (uncompiled script) are only being penalized on correctness which means that they could potentially get 15/20 which is well above the upper quartile.""
""Moreover, some students even deleted parts, that would have otherwise been awarded marks under design, to ensure their code compiled.""
""I feel that it really violates the principles of academic integrity as the question paper/TA/profs/invigilators straight up lied to us about the consequences of not being able to compile our code.""
""Next, as mentioned above, the 2 marks of encapsulation include removing all the Array<Integer> etc from the skeleton code given. Just not removing those fields caused some students to lose 9 marks as correctness and style were not even considered if encapsulation was not ""correct"". I personally faced this issue and my code did not use any of the Array<Integer> etc declared.""
""It is greatly disappointing that one of the most emphasised 'warnings' for the PE is also the greatest pitfall for many students who heeded it, yet were punished for not taking risk.""
""One of the reasons for the ""can't compile, 0 marks"" policy mentioned by the instructors was that as computer science students, the benchmark would be that we should be able to compile our code. Although I do suppose perhaps out of kindness or to even out the bellcurve, the teaching department has decided to still mark the work of students who weren't able to compile their code. However, I do hope that it is also clear that there are tradeoffs in every decision, including disparaging the care that students took in following instructions.""
The question is not if the ""cannot compile, 0 marks"" rule is fair or adequate, the question here is whether disregarding it entirely, and not considering the efforts of those who spent considerable time adhering to it, so much so as to go back and reverse/delete what could have been ""perfectly designed"" code, the question is if disregarding their efforts, and compliance to rules is fair.
One counter that I hear from my peers is they probably did this to reduce stress. My point here is that if they really wanted to reduce stress, they should have done it before the PE itself, changing a rule deemed tough for several years before the exam would have been fair to everyone and successfully met the goal of reducing emotional stress. Changing it according to performance of students and announcing it a month later does no good in reducing stress for someone who was already aware and had accepted his 0 marks. All it does is take the focus away from rules, and make students question and regret their choices, even when they'd religiously followed the rules.
This grading pattern sets a terrible precedent for PE2, where if just enough students get a 0, they'll not all get a 0. A given student would have no idea what rules to follow, what not to follow, how the grading will take place, what specific convenient frame of reasoning will be followed for the next PE. If they did
However, some of my classmates are now upset with me for requesting the regrade and causing their scores to be lowered. They feel that I should have just accepted the initial grades and not caused any trouble.
So, I'm turning to you, to ask: AITA for requesting the teaching team stick to the original rubrics causing a regrade and everyone else to score even lower? Was I wrong to prioritize fairness and consistency over my classmates' grades? I'm genuinely interested in hearing your opinions.

I relate with how you feel because my boyfriend is also similar.. We hang out once a week on sat & he eats at home on other days with his mom, which I don’t really mind because we can call and text.
BUT sometimes on sat he will at times ditch me 30 minutes before our scheduled time because his mom wants to have lunch together. His mom accompanies him to EVERY doctor & dental appointment. Guess what? It’s always on sat (I don’t know whether it’s coincidental or what). I don’t even know what time I’m meeting him and he always have his meals with her so I’m always eating alone =(
i felt uncomfortable deep down but I try very hard to be understanding … I mean, logically speaking, we are just his girlfriend (not his wife right?) and as compared to his mom who has brought him up for so long we should learn how to respect and give in. Also I don’t want to make things difficult for my bf.
Not too sure about your case though, my advice is that you need to think through , is he the only son? Is his mom a single mom? Etc. in my case I don’t know why his mom is so clingy because he has 4 other siblings (3 guy 1 girl) and he’s the 3rd in line. I wonder if his mom treats the rest the same as well? Or maybe because I’m from a single family (no mom) so I don’t understand that feeling? Haha
For the time being, I am trying to adopt a positive mindset. I feel that instead of being angry that your bf does this, why not be filial to his mother together? (Unless his mom really hates you la..then can’t be helped) if you are going to marry him in the long run then you have to try to get used to his family culture. From there, I think (hope) that he will appreciate your actions, and from there you can try to talk to him about how you actually feel and work things out together, instead of just telling him that “please accommodate to my needs”. Sometimes we really need to see from both sides of the story.
Nothing wrong with being a mommy boy and loving you at the same time :)
All the best to you!

For those who have ego and pride and use anger to hide their embarrassment for being rejected. Come on. You can choose people, then people cannot choose you? Love is not a charity event. Turn the tables around, would you give a person that you deem low quality a chance if you have absolutely no feelings for him/her?
If you have sufficient quality and assets, of course you will not blindly start a relationship with the first moving object that shows interest in you. Of course you would like to be with someone that you are equally attracted to. But do you attract that said person or you're not as great as you think you are?
Its very easy to blame others when something goes wrong in your life. But you learn nothing if you walk away without self reflection.

I know I'm fortunate to have positive influences in my life so I have learnt a lot from them. There's actually no secret formula to start a relationship but are you willing to face the truth about what you really are? Only when you truly know what you bring to the table then you can be realistic about what kind of a partner you can possibly find.
Why would you want to be with someone who wants out? Why would you want a shallow man or woman to be your special someone? You have to ask yourself why are you demanding love from someone who isn't interested? If you think long and hard enough, it's not about love but there's a chance that you think you deserve this person like a trophy and sometimes people can see your intents better than you.

It is no secret that some people step on others to get ahead. They make friends but only make use of them. I have heard stories, from different people, of one such person from his days in polytechnic to national service and finally university. Some of which, I witnessed it as well.
He failed to be valedictorian in polytechnic aerospace diploma and ranted about it while pretending to be nice. He was salty about how someone who is clearly smarter than him, got to be valedictorian. During poly as well, this person had a lot of co-curricular activities but only participated when the higher-ups were around or when there was an event, just to show his face and take pictures.
He also tried to snatch someone's girlfriend or crush and would blame his group members when other groups were doing better. This fake late bloomer claimed credits for everything, even when he had little to do with it.
During his national service, he got down PES due to knee surgery but kept playing badminton.
In university, he became a scholar for engineering but leech on people's help. I heard a hearsay that he didn't have money for condoms for intimacy and played the girl's feelings.
To top it off, he always volunteered for events and would take photos with MP during MP's walkaround, while his teammates were doing the actual work and not credited in the news article.

Don't get me wrong, I was never poor. my family gave me the very best they could and I was never hungry, just never had as extensive opportunities as those ""friends"" and I would be lying if I said I wasn't jealous. I'm also not saying that the govt's way of setting their criteria is foolproof, but I do think it is a decently accurate indicator, especially for some younger folks.
We were younger then, but looking back, I realised how tone-deaf they were and I won't be surprised if they are still as tone-deaf. Privilege is very real and I am ashamed that they don't recognise it and based on what we studied, frankly find it ironic. The amount given to us by the govt seems like an additional bonus, but to those really needy, it could be a month or two worth of groceries and utilities etc. Needless to say we aren't really friends anymore.

60546,106991,"I've noticed that some comments unfairly criticize one gender over another. I developed a bot that would use natural language processing NLP to analyze the sentiments expressed in the posts and repost it with the only gender swapped, to observe how the commenters would react. Also, it will screenshot the comments with the commenter's name to see whether they would post the same comments on both posts. After all, being equal is what equality is all about, right?
