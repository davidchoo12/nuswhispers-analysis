60840,107643,"Hi, I'm looking for some advice. I'm going on my first staycation with my new boyfriend this weekend. We've been together for about 2 months and this is the first time we will be intimate. All throughout my life, I've worn highly padded bras. I'm in between an A and B, but I've been doing this so long that I know how to make my boobs look like a large C or even D. I know my boyfriend likes it because he's complimented me a couple of times. This weekend, however, I'm afraid that my boyfriend will be disappointed when our clothes finally come off. I really like this guy and don't want to upset or lose him. What should I do?

60835,107637,"My best friend recently got a boyfriend and she keeps prioritising her boyfriend over me. I haven’t seen her in like 3 months and she rarely texts back now. Her work is busy so I can already hardly see her, but yet she always has time for her dates.
There are some activities I want to try with her but I am afraid to even ask her as I know she will take the idea and do it with her boyfriend instead (I did that and true enough, she keeps asking me for the place now so that she can go with her boyfriend).
Am I overreacting? What can I do? I feel like a second option now and it sucks.

60837,107639,"So I’ve been with my boyfriend(22m) for about half a year now and I want to introduce him to my family. The issue is my parents are very close minded and traditional. My boyfriend is not our race and has visible tattoos. On many occasions, they have made it clear on their opinions of tattoos, and even going as far as to say I will be disowned for having tattoos. I have tattoos of my own, but they’re not visible. However I actually do see a future with him and I’m certain that he’s the one I want to marry. Any advice for this ?

60838,107640,"Can anyone tell me how AITA in this situation?
Basically, in a whatsapp group, one of my friend sent a photo of his backyard, and it's at night. All he said was ""guys, I can't believe that thing is there"", implying that there's a supernatural being in the photo.
Then everyone in the group was like ""Omg that's so scary"", or ""That's insane knowing the ghost is right there"". Thing is.... There's absolutely nothing :/ I asked where, and everyone gave me a different answer, then all proceeded to go like ""Oh there's actually more than one that's scary"".
So what I did was, I took the photo, put it in Lightroom and just a touch of Photoshop to brighten up the photo enough. And there's still.... Nothing :/ I sent to them and they say I need to look carefully. I even changed different filter to make it clearer, and still nothing. I asked them where are the ghosts at all?
And they kicked me out of the group :/
I showed the photo to my family and other friends, all of them say they can see it and when I showed the brighten up photo edit, all of them hates me for pointing out there's nothing.
I learned that people just want to have the attention of ""Oooh look at meeeee I can see supernatural stuff ooooooh I'm cool you're not ooooh"" :/
So how AITA for calling it out? :/
Look, I believe supernatural being exist. Just, stop pretending to see it when there's obviously nothing. This is real life. Not some anime weeb shit where you have special powers to save the universe.
Please, grow up already sheeeeeeesssshhhh.

May I know the reasons you behind saying that? How can a Grad Cert or Master program be necessarily less rigorous than a Bachelors?
Based on my perusal of the module outlines, those grad programs seem similar to that of a CS Bachelors without some of the useless stuff like Science and General modules.

60833,107635,"I read a post here about a 10/10 girl or something and the comments were mostly not useful or just mostly trolls.
I am in a similar situation to the OP where I want a girl who is (8-10)/10 but I am probably much lower. I also have friends (both gender) who are in similar situations.
If you are someone that believes that someone's rating (not a good word but for discussion sake, pls let it through) should be static, then this post is not for you, move on pls.
The premise for this post is that you can improve your rating and possibly even become a 10/10 from a 0/10.
I think there are two main benefits of this thought -
Firstly, it is basically self-improvement, pretty sure it makes someone feel more confident, feel good and probably has results in a better life.
Secondly, you can get your 10/10 girl or your dream crush or whatever.
By the way, this 10/10 is not just physically attractiveness, it could mean other aspects such as personality or whatever.
I am a CS student so I think of things logically and step by step so there are here are questions:
Assuming I am starting out as a 0/10 person,
1) What are the main aspects I should work on to reach 10/10 (not limited physical attractiveness, can include others as well)?
2) How should I approach this problem?
3) What are resources that I can refer to, if any?
I hope this helps other people as well and is a positive thread.
There are quite a number of guys and girls in similar situations.

A little bit of drizzle and me listening to the sound of it hitting the ground while drinking a cup of tea made in a kettle put on a log of firewood and eating food, I have grown myself. This is my daily dream and it gives me chills. Not in a creepy way but in a way that shows me how much I want to run away from this life of mine and live a peaceful, pleasant life, far away, spending time and effort on only the things that really matter. Is this possible in Singapore? I have no idea but it is possible at my place and I am still not able to take the risk.

60845,107648,"I'm an attached guy similar age range to OP in #107611.
Unlike OP, I managed to land a successful match on a dating app and have since gone steady.
However, I was single like him once and I respect his bravery to keep at his own game. I was there in that former pain. I can relate and empathise.
Some of the comments are plain unrealistic and socially unreasonable in their expectations to OP.
The OP brought up a few good points regarding white-knighted and self-virtuous behaviour. It reeks so toxically online. Speaks volumes on how socially inhumane people are.
OP has already stated his stagnating experiences in social events, school activities and the like. People are shaped by their experiences. Who are you to question?
Most of you can't seem to relate that he felt pushed over the edge with no other option or space to interact with the opposite gender. Many of you are so easy to dismiss him for being dangerous and creepy by seeking to try approaching / talking up girls in public places. I guess society has dismissed you badly in your real-lives and make you miserable?
Hypocritically, if the OP wrote a salty rant on how no ladies have ever liked him, why he's single, and some misogyny, all of you would instead be slamming him for not putting himself out there and being a whiny spoilsport.
OP has never expressed he is sore on his fate. Yet you all still slam him for trying. And even calling him out for being sore. Don't get personal if you can't get your facts right.
For those who mentioned Pickup Artist wannabe, the lame comparison reflects on yourself. Out of touch from Dating Apps? Dating Apps and writing Intros is also some form of ""Pick-Up"" behaviour. Albeit online, not in real life.
The Internet also doesn't owe you a duty of care for tailor-worthy content. Some (not all) of you launched very personal attack towards the OP on this. If you have an annoying issue regarding OP's long confession, no TL;DR or that punctuation is misused. That's your own darn problem. Stop projecting your own illiteracy that onto the OP. You chose to read the confession, at your own will.
To those who mocked him for spending too much time over-formulating and asking OP to get his ass off to go outside. Don't forget that OP already spent his past 2 years outside, away from keyboard, working on himself. Only spend I presume 1-2 hours to write his confession? Whilst for you yourself, I also see your name pop up so frequently on the comments section in NUSWhispers? Who should be the one getting his ass off the keyboard and stop being the justice warrior?
As a former single myself, I can totally relate to why many other guys continue to remain Single. Other than the usual issues people mention, what people DO NOT MENTION is peer pressure by society to be socially perfect in decorum. Upon having a track record that you creep girls out, you get socially condemned.
You got to learn that the problem isn't necessarily on you and creep isn't a total reflective indicator of your failures.
I wouldn't be surprised if this is why so many guys give up and accept their fate to be single. And for the mental health rating to be so badly affected. A fear of judgment if they tried their own way to practice and work on it.
Single guys, if you have male friends who are stumping your social growth, overly supervising your image towards girls and being unreasonably critical on how you express yourself towards women, I beg you to reconsider your toxic ""friendship"" aka ""brotherhood"".
It may be better to stand strong alone in your own struggle. A healthy balance of dating apps whilst finding confidence in your own way might work just fine.

60843,107646,"To #107608, I'm a one such recent CS grad and take offence at your claim that we are in CS only for the money and not passion. I wonder where are your logic skills when you paint entire batches from your small sample size of a couple of junior SWEs.
While I do not dismiss your accusation that many in my batch chose CS because of the high starting pay, I have met many who are in CS because of similar passions in computing. They have sizable side projects and have formidable programming skills even before entering NUS. I dare say many did not need a CS college education at all if not for that piece of paper that HR and some jobs require.
On the issue of pay, what is wrong with going for courses that pay more? With times of high inflation, rising cost of living and housing prices, it's natural for us to go for degrees with higher ROI. It's economics 101 of demand and supply.
If road sweepers were to be paid the same as CS grads, tons of people will line up to be one. However, I'm certain you won't complain about the lack of passion of road sweepers.
Being in a MANGA company for a year and several internships in SMEs before I graduated, I have worked with many seniors. While some are good, I noticed a distinct and noticeable gulf between the average of those who graduated more than 5 to 8 years back and the newer batches. I recall Prof Ben commenting somewhere about seniors who were really quite weak so this is not an isolated observation.
Nobody said DS, AI and ML are the only fields in CS. However those skills are the current baseline for a CS grad and the tech industry. If you don't believe me, even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says those without AI expertise will be left behind. When you show no interest in them, you are only betraying yourself in not even having an minimum industry skillset. I honestly worry for your future in tech with this kind of stagnant mindset.
If your attitude is representative of your batch, you all deserve to be left behind in the dumping ground.

60844,107647,"Response to #107611
I took time to read through everything. I feel so enraged.
By the way people have put you down online.
Applaud your courage to have tried relentlessly over the past 2 years despite lack of results.
Who r the rest to negatively judge you for your actions? No one is perfect. At least you are actively trying instead of sitting around and sulking why you are single.
Seeing most of the 25+ comments on this confession, most of these comments are coming from socially-entitled and self-virtuous individuals who cannot be pleased and expect perfect decorum on social behaviour even when it means trying something that others don't dare to try.
Hypocritical that we keep advocating on a more socially inclusive and open-minded society/space. Society to also keep obliging that guys should put in effort to try work on their interaction and social skills towards girls and dating etc.
Yet when someone actually shares his candid experiences, its only met with white-knighted criticism and scrutiny. Have more social backbone and stop latching into other guys social failures to amplify your own moral high ground.
OP, word of advice for u. This kind of thing, better to share offline. People don't appreciate, so be it. Don't be too affected by what other ppl say. However, continue to work on your confidence so that girls feel less creep out. Learn to live life and let go.
Those ppl are the real coward to hide behind keyboard and attack you, whilst you have spent 2 years outside actively trying and getting actual work done. Some of their names appear very frequently on this platform unlike your confession. Online double standards are real.
