60903,107786,"How much should I give an unsupportive family?
27yo here who's about to start a first ft job. My pay is already well under median (4500) for a fresh grad from my course, and my parents expects me to give them an allowance of $1000 a month, approx 30% of my salary before CPF, inspired by my brother who's 23 and never has to pay for anything in his life including his uni and various hobbies unlike me, but he gives 100% of his internship allowance to them knowing they will happily take care of him.
My family is decently well to do, so money's not an issue for my parents. I'm obviously not the favorite child and am trying to save up quickly to move out, knowing that my parents will never be satisfied no matter how much I give them. I haven't even started work, and it's already ""Pay us allowance of $1000/month, or get out from the house and go rent a room for $1800 a month"". They know the housing market is messed up, and keep bemoaning that my room would be of better use ""rented out"". They're already chasing me to get out on a near daily basis, and it's clear they quickly want to burn bridges with me.
Here's why: My parents see me as an unfilial freeloader as I don't give them money at all -- I hustle and manage my money strictly, saving and investing (and reinvesting) nearly 80% of all the money I get from a few part time gigs into a few decently performing side businesses instead of giving them 100% of it like my brother. I haven't taken allowance from them since JC, I don't owe them anything, and quit clubbing when I was 18 to hustle and start my business, and have paid nearly 80% of my school loan off already working as a part time worker during my degree. I know that I can never rely on my parents to support me in any way, so I've got only myself to rely on, and I do not want to drag my girlfriend into this. Therefore I don't want to give them any money honestly, given that they've been less than supportive in my life.
To get advice for my situation, I'd like to ask here:
How should I deal with this impasse? When's the average age of moving out of the house? How much do fresh grads give their parents every month? And how does one remind their parents that it's their child, not a CPF (Child Paying for Family) retirement policy? 
Would appreciate some advice beyond ""suck thumb bruh, life's like that"" please! Thanks everyone.

60904,107787,"Am I too selfish to ask for the bare minumum in a relationship?
I’m in a relationship with this guy (not sure if I should still call it one) for 3 months. Of course at first it’s all sweet and everything and he definitely will put in a lot of effort but once he got the girl, the effort to keep the relationship going declines. He would start to go missing for hours without telling me where he went. And when I asked, he would avoid the question. I even double texted or triple texted everytime (after a few hours of him not responding to my texts). I understand that he may be busy with work but using 3 seconds to reply wouldn’t bite a skin off? I’m not someone who is irrational who expects 24/7 replies but at least to let me know that he’s safe. 
That’s not only the root of the problem. He’s a conflict avoidant. Everytime when we quarreled, he will try to avoid whenever I try to talk things out. I just want to solve the problem, not to make things worse. When things had cooled down, I tried to discuss again but he would pretend that nothing had happened when I said I’m already OK from the situation and nothing is to be discussed about.
I was the only one initiating texts and outings every time. He would do that last time but now he doesn’t do it anymore until I initiated. To him, once weekly meet up is enough but to me, quality time is important. I’m tired of being the initiator and I no longer feel the importance of my presence in his life.
As someone (him) who has been in a few relationships, I expected him to be more mature and able to handle these situations better but unfortunately, he’s not. Recently, he asked to take a step back because he’s not ready for these problems and when I asked what does that mean, he never replied. I really wanted to make this work but at the same time, I don’t know whether I should hold on or break up.

Or should I wait till I get a job before using dating apps in case nobody wants to date a jobless guy?

60905,107789,"I am currently married, with 2 young kids. Going to hit 40 soon. 
Born in SG, studied and worked here. By all accounts I have a comfortable life e.g. 5Cs all got. But there is a nagging feeling of doom around the corner; like you know everything is too good to be true so there must be something bad coming. 
I've had friends say just live in the moment don't overthink things but then I feel if I don't make plans for the future then I wont be prepared for it. If I try making plans I feel the need to manage every contingency that it becomes super stressful. I then end up trying to processify everything and making it a repeatable task that requires minimal input and tweaking. 
For example I hate monitoring investments, but believe in the value of saving. So will spend a few months studying the market and landscape, investigate the options, choose some investments, make it monthly deducting and then just let it go on by itself with sporadic checks. If it goes up or down I don't feel anything as to me its a long-term investment so let it be. 
I then force myself to try and be contented with life i.e. stay in same house don't upgrade, deny some luxuries, don't change car very often. After a few months I will be like why am I not pushing myself to achieve and strive for higher things. But then when I start doing the math of deciding to take larger investments e.g. car, house I will be worrying about economic and job uncertainty and if sensible to make such large financial decisions in such volatile times. 
I feel I was more hardworking when I was younger and extremely driven in career and money making, then watching my bosses and colleagues I felt continuing to do so would be detrimental to having a happy family so switched track and tried to be more family focused. I love spending time with my kids and spouse, organizing family get togethers and stuff. But after that feel super drained and wonder if I actually made a difference e.g. won't the kids have had the same level of happiness if I just sent them to some play area with other kids? 
I just want to know if there are other people who feel the same way? Always double guessing yourself and wondering if you are doing the right thing. How do other people deal with it? Am I some neurotic case that needs help or normal?
P.S. None of this is said to make anyone feel bad, or judge others who do things differently.

60908,107795,"One of my best friends in my uni group claims to be serial thief - what should I do?
I've known her for just over a year - the kind of girl who is attractive, draws stares from guys and very fashionable. On top of that, she is a very good friend - the kind who will stay up and chat with you when you're feeling down, or makes you little trinkets and just someone who is always there for you.
During one of our HTHT sessions...she was rather high and suddenly she began talking and rambling about how she is a serial thief and honestly we were all shocked. Based on her family background, she is very well to do and honestly hearing this was like a bomb being dropped on us. 
She proceeds to tell us in detail how she commits all these and how it's impossible for her to get caught...and till now the stuff she stole is over 50k - multiple small thefts that added up over time. The way she described her MO was simply unbelievable...yet at the same, if you ever saw her, just because she is the last person you think to commit theft makes it all the more believable.
Our group fell silent after that and didn't know how to approach the topic with her after sending her home (yes she passed out afterwards). She never talked with us about that after the session and some of the girls speculated that she got that idea and imagined herself as the thief after watching something.
As for what I think...the vivid way she described it seems a little bit too real. I really want to help her but I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place. I really don't want to lose her friendship, simply put...she could easily go to jail for this if its true. What should I do?
