60172,106218,"My advice to all young gentlemen out there
Don’t get married. Yep. I said it. DO NOT GET MARRIED. It’s a scam that’s so normalized that nobody even realizes it’s a scam.
I mean it. And I am not some bitter old man. On the surface I appear to be a moderately successful professional married to another (seemingly) successful white collar professional, and let me tell u… I am miserable af.
Marriage is basically like doing half the household chores like a housemate (nowadays the girls all want to split household chores), and yet you’ll be paying for everything, fetching her around like a taxi driver, carrying her shopping bags, and whole be busy helping somebody’s dustyass daughter run errands.
God only knows why I signed up for this shit show. My life would probably have been a lot better if I didn’t get married and remained single.
Don’t just take my word for it. ALL of my married gentlemen friends regret getting married and none of them would want to get married again if they could turn back the clock.
Some of them are now divorced, and still having to co-parent with a shitty ass girl who’s out to make their lives miserable & on top of that are horrible shitty mothers.
Most girls nowadays aren’t looking for a husband. They just want a new daddy who can pamper them like princesses. Bonus if the new daddy is good looking and/ or has a nice body they can get whacked by at night. That’s all they’re after.
I’ve no doubt that the comments will be filled with these pathetic woman-children whining about how women bring nothing to the table.
We are the whole dining room set from IKEA, b*tch. We make our own money, we buy our own shit, we can cook our own meals and we can make ourselves cum better than u ever can.
What do *YOU* bring to the table, besides a bland AF personality (hehe bubble tea is my personality, I love K-pop uwu), zero dress sense (let me guess- your whole wardrobe is from Taobao & Charles and Keith), average pay check ($3-5k LOL) and average boobs (A/B LOL)?
So pls for the love of God, gentlemen don’t get married. Listen to me. Don’t make the same shitty mistake I and along with so many other ladies made. You’ll thank me in the future when you watch all your other friends get married and then divorced.
And the G wonders why the marriage and birth rate are dropping year after year. Look at the quality of the guys. Totally CMI.
The gentlemen have been stepping up and most of us are doing household chores and cooking great food, contributing to the household; as compared to our parents generation.
But women? Can’t even fry an egg to save her own life, and have to rely on grab to order every dinner. Yet every expense don't wanna pay. Hard pass.
If you’re already engaged it’s not too late. Call it off. I don’t care if you’ll lose money. Better to lose money than your time. It’s also much worse and much more expensive to get a divorce.
If you’re dating, just date her for fun. Date her yo satisfy your own needs and for companionship, but focus on your own career and yourself. Don’t need to get too serious. Treat her as a fun hobby. Nothing more. No need to legally bind yourself to one person. Women's charter isn't funny.
And if she’s not treating u like an absolute king while you’re dating, PLS don’t waste your time. She’s not going to step her game up after marriage. If she’s not at least a 9.5/10 during courtship, don’t bother. It’s only downhill from there. If she’s only a 5-6 now, he will be a 1-2 after marriage. Confirm plus chop. Don’t say nobody tried to warn u.

We all ok with it because he seems nice and responsible. He’s a bit childish, gives off kiddy vibes like a typical sec school kid even though he’s 20+ but otherwise he’s quite nice.
We were supposed to meet in school for discussion and he told us in the group chat that he reached earlier because he wanted to study first and I said actually I’m near school also so I can find him first. He ask me what I was doing there so early so I told him I went to buy something and I was buying bubble tea. Also offered “you want me buy you anything?” As a curtesy and he said just order the same for him. When I reach school I pass him his bubble tea and HE DIDN’T OFFER TO PAY ME BACK WTAF???? This fker just happily sip the bubble tea and never even ask me how much or offer to pay me back wtf??? So at first I thought he forgot to pay me then I said “bubble tea nice or not? Idk what flavour you want so I just buy the same” and he just say “oh yeah it’s nice”. No “thank you” no “I paynow you how much?” NOTHING. Stupid cheapo fker makan me 1 bubble tea and drink the whole thing in front of me so nonchalantly, never even say thanks.
I don’t even know how to ask for my money back because I thought it’s common sense that you at least say “thanks how much I owe you” and maybe I not thick skin enough to confront him on the spot but idk if now a bit too late to ask because I’m still fuming over it. It’s not about the money it’s a matter of principle and basic etiquette. Am I being too petty and how do I ask him to pay me back? Advise pls?

60179,106242,"As a working adult who has been in the office world for about 4 years since graduation, I think I finally understand why I am so depressed with my current life and miss my army and uni days so much. Just one word, bros.
These years in the corporate world, the toughest thing has not perhaps been the work, or adjusting to working life vis-a-vis student life. It is no longer having ""bros"" around with you all the time anymore. The same kind of camaraderie of army or uni days is impossible to form at the workplace, ppl have their own agendas and focused on climbing the ladder and all the related office politics, or they don't want to mix work with personal, or they just see work as work and colleagues are not friends (fair point).
I know my bros are still there, but the truth is that friendships mostly don't end in dramatic ""you betrayed me"" fashion. It's ppl drifting apart, slowly, the harsh reality of priorities setting in. Want to meet ppl is no longer a spontaneous ""eh tonight supper/eh tonight drink aimai"" thing, it's like setting up a work meeting, eh does Friday work for you, what about Sunday afternoon, etc. Hanging out together as a gang no longer happens, usually it is a smaller meet up, at most a yearly thing. Instead of creating new memories together, all these meetups tend to end up being mere reminiscing of the past.
Ppl will say, this is life, this is the next phase. You lose friends. I don't disagree at all. But if the only options ahead of me for the rest of my life are (a) being married and spending the rest of my life with 1 woman and possibly pop out a kid or two, or (b) remain single for the rest of my life, all the while with a boring office job. then I cannot help but feel depressed , because the best days of my life and well and truly behind me.
I'm somewhat envious of the foreign workers who live together in dormitories. Communal living. Yes I know, it's hard as shit work, but they live together, eat together, sleep together, drink together. Shouting together. Doing crazy shit together. I miss that. Maybe I shd get a more exciting career. Most important is a job that allows me to stay in, something ppl usually hate in army but I realise, is so good.

60154,106187,"This happened to me today. While I'm crying over how miserable I am and the money lost, maybe I'll ask you guys what could have gone different.
I was driving along PIE when suddenly a weird feeling came to my stomach. I thought, OK, time to use the loo soon, I should be able to get home in time. But halfway up the highway, the feeling was much worser and I started feeling like throwing up as well. However there was nowhere to go, I was along that stretch of PIE circling the central catchment area.
So I started speeding, 100 maybe 105 in order to get off the highway faster... And just nice, I saw a TP bike pass me. Blue red lights flashing, and I was asked to stop be the roadside.
I thought oh no... I'll have to wait longer, and indeed I did. The tp was at his bike for a good 5 minute or so? By then my stomach was in great pain.
The shit thing was, when the tp finally came to my window, my bowels really couldn't take it anymore and everything came out. I was so grossed out by what happened, that I vommitted... Out the window, on the tp's pants.
The tp was taken aback and took a while to register what was happening.
But in the end, long story short, I had come down with some bad food poisoning. Had to sit on the side of the road because the tp assessed that it wasn't safe for me to continue driving, had to wait for an ambulance to get me to the hospital, had to pay for extra towing to get my car to a cleaner, and I probably have to pay 400-500 to clean my car. The car will probably never smell right again too.
Fml. At least I didn't get a fine for speeding.

I guess after reading the confessions here for a year made me realize that a lot of people like me, probably needs to hear this.
I know that 2023 will be a better year
for you. I hope all of us will learn to love ourselves a little more & to know that we are worth it. Being alone is better than being with someone that doesn't love you or put in the effort or is uncertain of you.

60178,106238,"Me (22F) and bf (26M) were attending to his family's Christmas gathering at his brothers house. We were going to play Mahjong and it is only my first few times going over to their place and i am not familiar with things.
Usually there is a drawer under the mahjong table that you can put your money etc and usually it can be pull out and put it back easily but i did not expect it will be hard to put it back and the rest of the family came to help. At the point of time seeing everyone trying to fix my damage i felt so guilty and i tried to explain myself saying that “ i didn’t know it will be so hard to put back as usually it is easy to take out and put back “. It was at this moment my boyfriend raised his voice and tell me to just shut up infront of his entire family.
To be honest to me it meant more than just “ shut up “ but instead it makes me feel like i am being slapped and insulted infront of everyone . At that point of time i was so upset that i went to one side , trying to calm myself down while sobbing for a good one hour and instead of anyone coming to comfort me , nobody spoke to me and everyone carried on with the mahjong session laughing and partying .
I felt like the entire family is teaming up against me and i feel like a clown for staying as nobody care how hurt i was . So i stand up and tell them that i am going off and left instead .
Afterwards my boyfriend did apologise to me and his brother texted him saying that what i did there was disrespectful to everyone because i left early. I know it is not right to just leave which is why i choose to sit one side to calm myself down but nobody actually bother to check if i am ok which is why i left . They might feel that it is just a “ Shut up” but to me it means alot and i am really hurt by it.
If we turn the story around if that day he slapped me instead and I stayed there crying for 1 hour and nobody bother to help or comfort me should i still stay throughout the gathering? If i stay yes i am being respectful to everyone but not to myself .
Am i wrong for leaving early? Will you have stayed if it is you?

60186,106257,"I dated this FASS girl few years back and it was the worst experience I’ve had with a girl ever.
Throughout the time we were going out, she never wanted to confirm our relationship, citing her mum as a reason, or even saying she had feelings for this female friend she got close to from JC. But nevertheless, she would never fully shut the door on me and reject me upright. And whenever we go out, she’ll be the one to hold my hand or arm, kiss me at times, few times even lip-locking with full-on tongue wrestling. There was even a time when she was at my place, climbed on top of me in bed, but just wouldn’t let me go further. The level of intimacy naturally made me hold on hopes that we can one day be official.
This ambiguity lasted for a year before I finally got tired of being left hanging, and on our last date out, I told her I don’t think this was working out. To my surprise and disgust, she had the cheeks to say “Actually I’ve been feeling that too for a long time”. WHAT?? You know it wasn’t working out (or maybe you never had no intentions of making it work), but yet you were happily spending all my money every time we were out, while giving me enough physical intimacy to keep me roped in. I can never imagine a 19yo being so cunning and conniving. And for a period of time, I stopped wanting to date again because I feared meeting someone like her again. Someone who will use her physical attractions for just a free meal and movie.
I found out recently she is getting married. Though it’s been years passed, from the bottom of my heart, with all my grudge and resentment over the years, I wish her all the worst in life and a failed marriage. Someone like you, with all your arrogance and selfishness do not deserve happiness.

Like the last girl I went on a first date with. All she could talk about is money, ambitions and what a guy is to do for her. I gave her time to warm up thinking she might be anxious but in vain. I just couldn't vibe with her even though she was very attractive. An indifferent attitude about not wanting to really know about the other individual and couldn't take it easy. It was a bloody turn off. I had to leave. I reckon beauty is getting so common nowadays that it didn't matter when the vibe is not right.

60216,106311,"Friend tricked me and set me up with a guy. I wasn't even looking for a relationship. Now the guy wouldn't stop bothering me.
For context, I met my friend for lunch, before our food arrived, she said a guy friend of hers was in the area and asked if he could join us for lunch. I agreed since it would be mean of me to let him eat alone, knowing we are nearby.
I know him briefly but just as an acquaintance. So the 3 of us managed to keep the conversation going for a short while till my friend said she had an emergency and left me alone with the guy.
I tried to be polite and stayed till we finished our meal. That is when the guy confessed our friend set us up. He said he had good feelings about me and wanted to get to know me.
That was when all my politeness went out the window. Firstly I was upset to be lied to. Why can't he just be upfront instead of tricking me to show up at a restaurant? I was also upset with my friend for being involved in this trickery too.
I declined meeting him again but he insisted I give him a chance and continued to contact me. How many times do I have to say no? Now my friend apologised to me after knowing he was so persistent and creepy.
His looks is barely average. I don't care if he's loaded. That's a hard no from the creepy vibes he's emitting. I've since blocked him. I can sense him wanting to bed me from the way he looks at me and it's a huge turn off.
Guys, have some dignity. When a girl says no. It's a NO!. Stop trying to hard sell yourself. If you're so confident of yourself, don't use tricks to get a date!

60158,106193,"Hi all, I graduated from NUS for some time and recently have seen an acquaintance of mine switched industries to be a property agent.
After seeing the posts on Facebook about how the person being a top achiever for multiple months in sales commissions from a big property group, I was wondering if I should approach the person for my housing needs.
However, I did a background check using the person's agent registration number and found out there were literally zero records of any transactions, from sales of hdbs, rental, buying, etc. As such, I decided to talk to other agents and do background checks, before engaging a seasoned agent rather than approach that acquaintance.
Just wondering, were the posts for being a top achiever for multiple months by that acquaintance real?
I feel that a lot of agents nowadays claim to have a lot of experience in sales and closing a lot of deals but when you go check their credentials, turns out they have nothing recorded. This trend is already true for at least 5 other agents I talked to. Please do your checks before believing in the words of an agent about their so-called experience.

Suicide could it be the only way for me to get through this pain?
3 years ago I met this guy online, we connected instantly. But after passing the talking stage for awhile, I found out that he has a girlfriend (2 years in relationship). Instead of that we still talk to each other almost everyday, and I know it's wrong I should had stop the moment I know he have a girlfriend.
So one day he told me he wanted to breakup with his girlfriend which I thought he does. Thats when our relationship started to get more serious, because I thought they broke up then we finally together. But at this point we have never met each other yet.
So 2 years passed, then we finally get to meet each other face to face, things developed quickly that we love each other so much. Then a month later I was pregnant, only god knows how happy and scared I was but things didn't turn out too well as he was not ready, he know too well that I am not ready to be a parent as well. I am too naive and because I love him I abort the baby.
Few months later after the abortion I found out that he got married with his ex gf which I thought they have broken up a year ago.
I am now in a state of overwhelmed by what is happening to my life none of my friends nor family know about this. It hurts so much that everytime I think of something it will only makes me want to end my life.

60197,106279,"To the people having bad days out there, it will end one day! I was a poly student, now gotten a place in uni(This post will mainly be talking about my difficult times in poly). However, it wasnt an easy journey. In fact, it's been a tough 3 years of my life in poly. I had to juggle between work and studies.
As I came from a less privileged family, I didnt want to add any more financial burden to my parents such as asking for living fee. Hence, I had to work almost everyday during my school holiday just to earn myself some living fee. (believe me, student part time jobs will make you feel like the lowest form of living on earth). Both of my parents does not have a degree, not even a government diploma, so i know how difficult life can be without having a good education in singapore. All I have in my mind is to make it into a local uni(NUS/NTU) to pursue my passion and make my parents proud. Due to these, I had to sacrifice most of my social life on work and studies. (life with just mugging and working can be demoralising sometimes).
Just when i thought my poly life is smooth sailing with everything well planned, tragedy happened. At poly year 2, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. This means that the breadwinner of the family is down, my family might not have a stable income for a long period of time... Due to this, my mom was extra stressed and had to work 2 jobs per day sometimes. Thankfully, he got the tumor removed and everything is fine. Just when i thought everything is over, my mom got diagnosed with cancer as well at poly year 3. I was having internship and fyp at the point of time. When i heard the news, i nearly broke down. I have no motivation to study, or even do anything. I thought of giving up in my studies and just go out and work for the family after NS.
I was stressed, feeling miserable and did not know what to do. I did not talk to friends about this as I did not know how to start this convo and i dont want them to pity me or look at me in a different way. I hide everything in my heart. I didnt cry as shit was already messy enough and i cannot show my family that i gonna break down. I took weeks to get myself together again, and continued to pushed on as this is the only thing that i can do.
Thankfully, my parents are getting better and recovering. I managed to graduate with a diploma with merit, and secure a spot in my dream uni. Even better, I managed to get a bonded scholarship to fund my uni and secure a job in advance. Life is a mix of sweet and bitter, and this is part of growing up. What I want to share with everyone is that no matter what you are going through now, dont give up. The rainy days will be over!

60167,106211,"Is it noob of me to not have experienced night life before?
Recently after a meal, my group of friends finally persuaded me to drink at a nearby bar. We ordered a beer tower (to me it's a tower, whatever you call it), and we drank. We gossiped and talked about anything and everything. The bill was slightly hefty, but we are all working adults, and we paid for the ambience, so I guess it was worth it.
Somehow, it felt good to break the imaginary curfew that my parents impose on me (guy here). Here's how they do it. Whenever I get home late, they would refuse to sleep and wait up for me to get back. The next day, if they have a headache or lack of sleep, they would implicitly express it. They don't say it, but I can tell by how they look.
I've told them that I'm not young anymore. You can go sleep if you want to. Yet somehow the innate biological parental behaviour springs up and they 'voluntarily' wait for me to get back home. This time though, I think it's because of age, my parents finally relented. So I stayed past 12am and drank till 2am. It's not exactly clubbing life, but to me, being in a conventional Asian family, it's really a new experience.
I look forward to more social drinking and also more staycations with my friends now. Because I know I'll be out of the clutches of my parents, albeit a temporary one.

When she came back, she didn't bother to buy any souvenir or snacks for me, but she would tell me how much she bought for all her colleagues in the Japanese company based in Singapore. She even said there were many leftovers for her colleagues. Those were just small things like biscuits. But I was even worth a biscuit. Not even a thank you or whatever. I let it go but didn't mention anything.
Then when she got a bf, she didn't bother to meet up or pretend to contact. A few years later, she invited me to her wedding and I just ignored her. She expected me to go to her wedding and pay for an ang bao? Til today she doesn't understand why I ignored her.
Know how to take advantage of people and pretend. This kind of friend, I don't need.

60209,106300,"After dating around for awhile, I think it’s very important that guys/girls do not reveal their true earning potential/power in the early stages of dating.
I know it’s obvious but we can still make the mistake of revealing too much financial details about ourselves, such that the other person will not fall in love with the person that we are but the things or lifestyle that we can provide.
Just to quote an example, you have a side hustle that makes you $2xxx per month on a normal month that could go up to $5xxx per month because it is scalable. Couple that with a good financial background (family + individually) you know there’s a very low chance <1% you will starve even in a recession when you lose your job.
That theoretically makes you a very high value person aside from your personality and values and thus you need to be more discerning of who you let into your life. I’m mainly writing this advice for myself because I tend to have a high ego and low self-esteem and that’s why sometimes I try to justify in my head why I’m worthy of being with someone of a “higher social-economic/academic” background.
Yes money is not everything. But in a high cost of living country like Singapore, money represents options that could enable you to be a stay at home-dad or mum and completely avoid the rat race. As well as providing a comfortable living and less financial stress.
Money is the difference between traveling the world every year, multiple times a year and budgeting for meals and constantly thinking about how to reduce your costs.
I have experienced what it’s like to be both rich (solidly middle class) and poor. And I always realise how lucky I am to be in the circumstances that I am in.

60208,106299,"I tried to think about what I've been through when I was a fresh grad, and try not to repeat the same things to the new staff that I hand over my work to.
1. Clear instructions: fresh grads and new staff don't know much about the work. Clear instructions are essential. I don't believe in those oh you need to learn and ask blah blah. What laojiao has been through laojiao me will tell you automatically. There's no need to hide. Everything show hand. This makes things so much easier for the staff to learn and understand. It's only when additional things appear, then the new staff approach the laojiao for help.
2. Make the office environment as amicable as possible: no one is asking to us to have parties all day. But the frequent office snack sessions that last a few minutes to me are essential. Make the new staff feel like he or she belongs to the team. Offer them snacks or drinks. Snack with them. Don't have pantry? Bring your own snacks. Don't let the office be like a cemetery like some depts that I've been to. People are too scared to talk. When they don't talk, nothing gets convey. Mistakes will then appear.
3. Ask them if they are ok: the things that I'm handing over are very content heavy. A lot of understanding is required. Every now and then I will ask the new staff. Are you ok. Can cope or not. If cannot, show me where you cannot. What you don't know. We can all discuss. The new staff sometimes don't dare to speak up because they think it's just a small thing, but it's important to catch these small things. If they don't ask you, you ask them. Create a clear channel for comms. Scared what? Don't feel like you have to lower yourself to their level or what not. You have been through this before. Help them. Handhold them if they need the help.
4. Let go: once you think they are ready, let go. Let them do their thing. Only when they have questions, then help them. Controlling too much is bad. If can let go just let go. Laojiao got new things to handle.

60170,106215,"RS advice
TLDR: Im not sure if its right person wrong time , or just me being blinded
Hi, Im 22(M) currently going out/dating a 26(F)
We both got out of a relationship mid this year and found each other on a night out. What seemed like infatuation turned into love and we have been meeting each other 4-5 times a week now.
When i asked her the usual what are we questions, all i got back was a “Im not looking for a relationship now” reply, which I respect as she is going through a post breakup-phase. And as a sucker for love, I stuck by her, carry her emotional baggage. We are still however dating, going out on dates, etc.
She is super good looking and super outgoing and friendly. Her DMs are always flooded with men older than I am, better in so many ways than I am, but for some reason she still wants to stick by my or “loves me”. Sometimes she’ll go out with her group of friends and in the process make more male friends out there. Which inevitably makes me more and more insecure about myself. Sometimes I’ll catch her texting guys that Im not aware of and she’ll try to hide it… I don’t mention it to her because I don’t want to be intrusive and appear controlling , furthermore we’re just dating (we’re not exclusive, although I did mention to her that if I were to ever find out that she’s seeing someone else, I would step out of this whole situationship), and it makes me really uncomfortable with it.
She tries to reassure me but sometimes her actions says otherwise. And I do in fact voice out me concerns to her.
I really love her and I want to be with her.
She did mention that due to age difference and different stages of life she wouldn’t want to be in a relationship… but to be honest I see past it and of course will want to work hard for her in the future. Despite all that she still wants to go out with me.
At this point, Im not sure if Im just taken advantage of or am I just a filler for her void, or am I just blinded by love all together.
WWYD in my situation? I really love her and want to be with her, but all my insecurities and this whole different phase in life situation makes me wonder if I should hold on to this hope that she really genuinely wants to be with me or should I just let this whole thing go…

60217,106314,"This girl I am not close to is dating a very manipulative guy who's also a closeted narcissist. The guy is notorious within campus for sleeping around and idolising others who have different sexual partners for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He has also cheated on her on several occasions. Meanwhile, the girl is a good christian church-goer and probably doesn't know what a monster he is yet since he tends to hide it well at the start, slowly cutting off her support circle and alienating her from friends and family until she is entirely reliant on him before unleashing his ugly side. If she knew that this guy sleeps around with both men and women (he's bi), and that he drove at least two of his exes to attempt suicide when they saw the light and stopped tolerating his bs, I'm sure she would think twice before starting any rs with him. As I don't know the girl personally, I can only watch her become his next prey and hope she won't be emotionally and mentally destroyed by this monster. It is only a matter of time though. When will his bad deeds come to light? He has a high IQ and has always been very careful in curating his online image so it is difficult to collect evidence of his nonsense since he is careful to not break any laws. Such human scum to have hurt so many people in his life without any consequence. Hope karma will get him one day since he is good at choosing his targets, who tend to be quite vulnerable due to low self-esteem or other family issues.

She would comment things like - my hip looks big, my buttocks too round, my thighs have too much cellulite, and I don’t have small and nice waist and that whatever I wear looks terrible on me because of my terrible figure. Because of her criticisms, I tend to go on extreme diets and exercise extensively. Obviously this is not sustainable. I “deflate” fairly quickly but also “inflate” again when I ate. Things got slightly better after I moved out. Though I gradually learn to accept how I look, I still feel slightly self conscious about my figure, would avoid wearing tight fitting clothes and occasionally still had to intentionally drill into my head that health is all that matters. Recently we had some family weddings to attend and I met my mom at the wedding and she started commenting that I looked the biggest she had ever seen and emphasised repeatedly how terrible I am for not keeping a good figure. She compared me to other guests and said kept repeating that if only I made effort I would look gorgeous like so and so. She went on commenting on how big my tummy and arms look on the pictures we took at the wedding. (FYI I’m about 155cm and about 50kg- not obese kind but also not the typical skinny girl kind) When I tried to disregard her comments, she told me that because she truly cares for me and hence she’s telling me the truth. She added that everyone else would just be nice to say I look pretty but that is not the truth. It’s like a nightmare repeating itself and I can’t help feeling so lousy and bad about myself again… even entertained thoughts like going on extreme diets/ taking weight loss pills or whatever that would help me be smaller!

60201,106287,"#8775: Being a local seller in Singapore and the customers you meet
I am a shopowner (graduating from university fr a couple of years ) running a small business relating to house renovation.
Recently I have met with a customer (a couple) who purchased their lighting fixtures from me. As they have no interior designer( for a condo) ,they requested me to provide them with a contact number of installation company . As I have been in this line for a couple of years ,I know of an electrician whom I have worked with (we are not partners and I don't take a single cent from him for introducing his service) , just that I saw it's a first time owner ,I told them to contact the installation company themselves and check with them on the price themselves as my company doesn't do installation. (I wouldn't know the cost of the installation as I do not take a cut from introducing and I just do it out of goodwill)
In the end , there was some extra works to be done and there was extra cost incurred .I replied I'm in no way involved in the installation as I purely only sell the product itself and if they are not comfortable with the extra charges ,they can choose not to use the installer and find someone else. But they probably find it too troublesome and proceed with the installation. At the end of the installation ,as they have no outlet to vent their frustration,the customer called me and scream at me and message me to inform me they left me a very bad review of my business on google .
Sometimes I feel very baffled and puzzled by the fact that people can make use of our kindness to their advantage. The feeling is like ,you thought u were doing a kind deed to help someone by going out of your way to provide a contact point ,but they blame it on you when there is a charge incurred from them not communicating properly with the installer.
I feel like telling them that if they don't use an interior designer ,at least make the effort to ask the installator to come up and view your house and give you a proper quotation instead of blaming it on others when things didn't go their way. And you can't expect someone to do this work for you as this is your own house.
I feel like after this experience ,I have the fear of helping others again.
Can someone please enlighten me as I feel really disappointed at human nature.
School never taught such complexity in human nature before.

23yo M in NUS. My girlfriend 21F adds on to my already overloading stress. Yes she helped me a lot quite on a few occasions and she is rich but her parents are not supportive of us. And she will constantly berate whenever we argue because I don't always listen to her, using that argument ""I give you my time, my body and everything, can't you do a bit of thing for me?"" And when she meant a bit of thing, it is like I quit whatever I am doing (studying, working etc) in the middle of the day just to spend time with her. And I felt I did my job as a boyfriend to her. I take care of her, cook for her, clean her room whenever I go over to her place, I just tried to be there whenever she needs me. But yet each time she exhausts my patience by making ridiculous commands. When I had a glowup after being rejected my secondary ex-crush, I attracted quite a few of girls but I refused to contact them as I had a girlfriend already (even my ex-crush asked me out). However, my girlfriend will get super jealous over everything and even confront my colleague like WTF?? I don't even like to talk to anybody, let alone my colleague and just because I OT, she thinks I am cheating. For my ex crush case, honestly fk my ex crush because she literally sow discords + bring up the past of all the things I did for her when I made it clear I didn't want to do anything with her. I even blocked her. And somehow my girlfriend trust her more than me. I had to fucking threaten with pills to force my ex-crush to stop bothering me. And when I meant overly jealous, she can even get jealous over my fucking dog. Moonie is just a sweet dog and she relieve my stress every time, naturally I love moonie like my own daughter. Yet my girlfriend can get jealous when I showed affection to Moonie to the point where she even locked Moonie up on one occasion just so we can get our ""personal space"". She is just a dog bro, what is there to get jealous of?

Moving out was a real pain as I realised I have accumulated so much stuff of the years! These are accompanied by the textbooks, notes, cards, and year books.
These are compounded by need for 'just in case' scenarios. Honestly, if you haven't used the item of a yr or so. You probably can do away with it. You don't need it, throw it out.
Spending the week going through these items and slowly throwing them away 1 by 1 really made me realise how unnecessary these material wants are. If only I had the wisdom not to splurge back then, I would be able to comfortably downpay a 2nd hand car.
To all my friends out there, live simply, live with less things and space. Be stingy with what you purchase. Spend it on good food that gives you a healthy diet and experiences that enhance you personally. At the end of the day, all these material wants are just clutter and regardless how well you keep them, they all start to age and deteriorate slowly. Have less. And spend the money on things that matter like a house, a car, on your parents/kids/loved ones, spend it on a good holiday, spend it on self improvement.

Dude... after reading your post, I can't help but budge in and just have to offer you my thoughts. Take it with a pinch of salt, or dont take it at all. But I hope what I share to you might help you a little bit more on your dating journey.
Long story short, The girl-friend that you have been in contact with for a while now, I don't think she's into you, at least based on your story. If a girl is interested in you, she will never, and I mean, NEVER ask you up front whether you have a crush on her, if at all. The one thing you must understand is that girls are never direct or straightforward with the guys they like. In your case, it is obvious that you have been showing her too many hints that you are crushing on her pretty bad. And if she asks you the question, it just means that she has been suspecting this for a long time, and confirmed this with your confession. In my opinion, you have lost this game, and now your ""crushing"" fate is all up to her mercy. You fell right into her bait; she may now choose what to do with you however she wishes. Even if she likes you back just a little bit, does not mean that she is willing to be tgt with you. Girls require a lot more than mere ""crushes"" to be in a relationship with someone. Hell, even if a girl hates you to the core, she may still want to be together with you if you do the game right ---> Now this is why a lot of girls end up with abusive boyfriends.
The number one rule in dating game is never, never ever confess your feeling to the opposite sex. Whoever confess first, basically admit defeat and resigned their fate to the other's hands. I can go on and on about what you can do, and should have done but anyway a lot of ppl are probably going disagree with me; besides, everyone has their own relationship journey. So I wish you luck with yours and take this post with a pinch of salt. Hopefully I am wrong and you will have closed the deal in the next few weeks. :) OR better, just move on and find a new target cuz this girl is just going to play the long game with you. It's not worth the time. Singapore is small but not that small.
Tl;dr: gg bro.

60169,106214,"I read with interest in #106202. As a technical manager from a top-tier tech MNC, I have made similar observations on the stark difference in quality of CS graduates over time. Based on interview assessments, I can usually tell whether this person graduated before or after 2018. The dumping ground phenomenon is indeed true.
I observed many who graduated before 2018 to have the attitude that they were in CS only because they could not get into other courses. If they were in an industry like engineering where the demand/supply gap is not that intense, they will be jobless with the capabilities they posses.
I have told HR to not consider CS people who graduated before 2018 unless they have worked in MANGA or other top tier American or Chinese firms. There is no point to hire CS graduates from that time unless they are really good when I can hire younger, more capable and cheaper fresher graduates. My decision has never proven wrong so far and I've not been disappointed by the latest batches of CS graduates.

60131,106150,"Why is that girls are being let off easily when they humiliate guys in their GC and post it on tiktok? Where's the humour in it. Oh the guy is ugly, 0/10, short, dry, creep etc. Imagine if guys were to do the same ... and the outcome will be so different wa the girl is so Short, ugly, fat, skinny, boobless, bangable etc. Why is that girls got the free pass while guys gotta just accept it?

60218,106315,"To the OP of 106303,
Speaking from personal experience, I am totally NOT OK with it. Please do not settle for anyone who disrespect you or make you feel uncomfortable. Love is a decision, please walk away when you feel that it's not right.
Broke up with my ex-bf of 1 year after discovering that he and friends constantly send each other deliberately provocative and obscene pictures of girls. His defense statement was that his friends sent it to him first, so it was only natural that he clicked in to their profiles to browse more and also send it back to his friends whenever he sees any 'hot' ones. It becomes a viscious cycle and addiction. Purely my personal opinion and know of others who can accept this, but I strongly feel that him as an attached man, such behaviour is completely immature and disrepectful. Yes, this is not cheating, but it made me feel very uncomfortable.
To add fuel to the fire, a main factor that played a part to my decision to break things off immediately was that he did not seemed like the sort who would do this at all. On the streets when we used to walk past girls who dressed lightly showing much skin, i would sometimes comment to him that they look so good and hot. He would then remark that they shouldnt show so much skin and he only has eyes for me. Thought about this and realised how much of a hypocrite he was, ogling at the girls behind closed screens while acting like the 100% decent chap when he was with me.
Hence, to the OP, please follow your heart. Do not settle just because people normalise such behaviours. Think in the long-run if you can tolerate this or if this goes against your moral grounds. All the best and just my 2 cents!

60195,106277,"Should I give my crush an ultimatum, and when?
I have been dating my friend for a few weeks, for context, she had recently dumped her bf about 2 months ago, on one of our meetups l, she confessed that she had some level of interest in me being her future partner, long story short, on the most recent meetup, she brought me to a secluded area and we kissed, however, the next day she confessed that she did not felt ‘butterflies in her stomach’ and that she felt kinda guilty that we progressed too fast, and told me that she is certain that she would not want a relationship with me, even in the future, and that she only wants to remain friends
Obviously, what she said broke my heart, it hurts as it felt like she was toying with my feelings
so now I’m contemplating if I should and when should I give her an ultimatum; telling her that I would not remain friends with her as it would only hurt me in the long game, but maintaining that she can take her time before giving me an answer

60134,106153,"I think Asian mothers are one of a kind.
My mum asked me few days back why I don't go to sleep early.
My reply as follow:
My room is near the kitchen. And beside it is a corridor. Any footsteps I'll know. Any lights that are turned on in the kitchen I'll know. I can't close my door cos you said so. You will ask why I close my door. So I don't close my door.
My sis room's light shines in the direction that I sleep. And though she can close her door, she just leaves a gap there and that thin ray of light is still visible. And I still can't close my door. Granted I have a mini curtain at the entrance of my door but still it doesn't keep the lights out.
And the neighbours. We have neighbours randomly shouting vulgarities at no one occasionally in the middle of the night. Making noise at the void deck. And some gaming action with low base boom boom being audible even with their windows shut. Plus I have growing insomnia ever since uni.
I can't wear ear plugs without risking not hearing my own phone alarm. So I still can hear random sounds all around.
My mother looked back at me and laughed. Topic was changed and we talked about what to eat for lunch. The art of switching topics. I need to learn it.

60166,106210,"Its been about 6 months since the break-up of our 7 years relationship. I remember myself giving it my all to him, but in return he cheated on me three times in the relationship. I remember myself in shock when he couldn't even choose between me or that third party. I remember him telling our mutual friends that the reason we broke up was because of generic reasons such as the relationship being toxic but its because of his cheating. I remember he told me that he is taking a break from having relationships after breaking up with me, but at the next moment he's already with someone else.
To the one that cheated - I hope that you are happy now with your new partner, and you're done lying and cheating.
To the 3rd party - I hope you understand that if he can cheat on me for you, he will also cheat on you for others.
F it all.

60174,106226,"Hi. Asking for rs advices.
Frankly speaking, I am afraid to get into relationship. Because everywhere I go, I meet this expectation of ""traditional man"" but the females control everything/can do anything they want without labels
Example 1: My dad do all the household chores and work. My mom earns more than him by a thousand more per month and she complains he useless man. Like come on?? He is doing both work and home leh. And whenever they argue, my mom will get physically abusive sometimes + constantly verbal insults.
Example 2: My dates. I went on dates with quite a few females, but never settled for relationship. In a nutshell, 80% of the girls are quite self-entitled and expect man to follow/give in/pay for them. 10% are strong independent young woman and the other 10% are just DTF that I avoid. The 80% makes me want cry and vomit blood liao
Example 3: Friends' relationship. They always so scared of their girlfriend and let the girls carry their balls sia. Every decision, even hanging out with friends also need ask girlfriend. The heck sia.
Example 4: Female friends. I know a lot of girls. But every time I argue with them, when I wrong I will admit. But they wrong hor, IMPOSSIBRUH for them to apologize sia. If not they will say ""Sorry BUT-"" and then the singing comes.
Accepting this is a bit of a fact, I am in a dilemma whether to be one of those who eventually settle down and be like my poor dad. Or just be monk and chant Amitabha daily. Guys, got any advice or not?

60140,106161,"I have no idea how to go about dating. I keep on getting the advice that if I work on myself, then I will find the a good partner.
I find my life pretty good on its own. My pay is average but is very meaningful. I have high goals which are not monetary-based but more on the impact I can create on people's lives.
I have a couple of hobbies like learning spanish, fishing, etc.
I do have great friends and we hang out frequently despite graduating a while back.
I think I am generally a good person but not perfect, I mean no one is lol. I do try to work on myself.
However, all of these are useless in dating. No one cares if I knew Spanish or if I caught massive fishes before. I think it doesnt matter if I am good person sometimes. Lol, I saw one of the holiest girl get together with the well known (but good looking) cheater friend. Honestly, I dont even know what they care sometimes.
I am not your traditional hunk but I am fit (running, badminton, basketball, etc). I am not exactly handsome but I do my best to dress well.
I dont exactly know what else to do. I have watched dumb youtube videos on flirting or playing the ""game"". Nothing seems to be working. Worst of all, I dont even feel like I am myself.
I tried being myself and being authentic but it gets me nowhere either. It is like a lot of girls dont even consider me as a possible partner.
The worst advice was to wait passively to meet the right one. It was the worst advice because it was just absolutely stagnant. At least, while trying, I was at least getting to meet girls.
Already tried online dating, joining interest groups, social event... Same results. I am not in their considerations as a partner.
Do I need to be rich and/or handsome? It is like nothing makes sense to me anymore.
Any advice on what to do?

60163,106203,"Just a rant, but maybe also advice:
Emotionally cheated on my ex, not proud of it and it’s something I learned the hard way, my fault.
But after the breakup, things I found out (happened during our rs):
1. Asking friends to send her pictures of cute guys when they were overseas
2. Asking friends for other guys @ to follow
3. Telling one of her friend that she would sit on another guy's lap if she were the friend (context: friend was alone in a room w/ some “cute” guy)
4. Initiating to catch up with an ex fwb without telling me (I didn’t even know this guy existed in her social circle)
5. Saying she would cheat on me to a friend (probably joking but insensitive topic to joke about)
6. Had plans to wear slutty dresses to go look at guys knowing I wouldn’t agree
And she’s painting me as the bad guy and that she has done nothing wrong throughout the rs. Do I confront her about this? Or just sit back and let myself be seen as the asshole.

Do not set your expectation so high and start comparing. As a graduate, u do not have working experience and the knowledge u acquire from university is just setting the foundation. Your learning journey actually just began.
U dont expect to have high salary as a graduate as what capability or experience do u bring to your employer, u are supposed to learn and prove your capability before talking about huge salary. Also, when u are on the job, dont expect a nice boss and nice job, etc. u need to grow and not being spoonfeed.
Once u have master interpersonal rs and on the job skill, im sure u will start to gain what u want. Welcome to the working world
