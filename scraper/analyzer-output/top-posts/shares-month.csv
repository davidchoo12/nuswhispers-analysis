She has weak immune system since birth and has been in and out of the hospital. Recently, she was diagnosed with terminal illness with low survival rate. Suddenly I lost all motivation in life. I don’t even want to go to school. To add this on, Her family is asking me to move on from her but I can’t do it. The reason is because they do not want my marital status to be widowed after their daughter pass on.
Life is so fking unfair. I hope all of you in a relationship will cherish each other and don’t do things that you will regret. Enjoy and spend more time together. Work out any arguments before it is too late.

59530,104917,"I'm currently dating a teacher for about 2 years, who is 3 years into the job (after PGDE). While we really love each other and are serious about one another, I'm a bit uncertain about our future together due to her workload and commitment to work.
Here is a sample of her average day:
Wake up at 540am
Leave house at 630am
Reach school by 710am
Teach classes till 130-2pm
CCA/ remedials/ meetings/ misc things till 530pm, leave school
Dabao, Reach home at 630pm
Eat dinner and chill to 8pm
Marking from 8 to 1130pm
Shower, etc, till 1230pm
Catch up on emails till 1am then sleep
So based on that, she works maybe 14-15 hours every weekday with just 4.5hrs of sleep and a good day every weekend just to catch up on work that couldn't be completed and lesson plans. Based on her salary, it's just ridiculous how much she has to work for that - Retail and F&B workers are better paid hourly than her.
I've been getting into fights with her and telling her that her lifestyle and is unsustainable as it'll lead to big burnouts and her health will suffer. On the flip end, she says that I'm not a teacher and I'd never understand her line of work.
Also, I realised that a lot of her teacher friends (female), are single well into late 30s and 40s - which I guess its due to their teaching lifestyle. On the flip end, most women I know from my line of work (private) are married by their late 30s.
I sincerely hope MOE can do something to lighten teacher's workloads. While that is wishful thinking, I'm wondering if I could get any advice on how to move forward...or move on.
Frankly I although I love her a lot, she had made it clear that her priority is to be a good teacher. So at the back of my mind, there is always this feeling that she loves teaching more than me.
Also, although we both agreed on having children, based on her workload, I don't see how we would be able to manage as I'm afraid she'll leave majority of the child rearing to me while she continues her passion. My job is way less tiring than hers and honestly I'm earning more than double of her - and in order for me to climb more, I need her to do her fair share of child rearing. I've mentioned to her that if we got married, I'd like for her to take a step back from her overloaded schedule and this was utterly shot down and more quarrels ensured.
So now I'm at a crossroads - should I push on and try to make things work, or try to move on to find someone who able to be more family oriented?

59415,104714,"I'm with my girlfriend for 3 years. She's been bugging me to marry her and its really starting to stress me out. I didn't tell her I actually have a 6 figure savings accumulated from my deceased father's will on top of my own assets and let her think I'm a pauper. She even gave me money once when she thought my family finances was tight but I rejected it. A part of me decided she is the one after she did that.
My mother told me to never flaunt our wealth so as not to attract the wrong people so I guess I start to feel funny about money since young. We mostly go to hawkers and only visit restaurants when there is a special occasion like birthdays or Christmas. Our dates are usually very low costs. I like that when the weather permits, we have the habit of alighting earlier from the train or bus and spend more time walking together and talking to reach our destination.
I lied to her that we can't afford a flat yet and she showed hand me her savings and say she can and kept asking me not to waste her time in a joking way. Her family is pretty well to do. Her dad even gifted her a car when she got promoted but she sold it as she's not confident driving.
The problem I have with my gf may be insignificant to some couples. I don't really have any major red flags or issues about her. Even if she's not my gf, I would think of her as a great person to have around. I know other men will find her very eligible given her looks, personality and family background. My mother loves her and already considers her a daughter in law. But I have a but. I'm not ready. We are in our late 20s.
How do you become ready? I'm so in love with her but I just couldn't make myself get down on one knee and ask for her hand in marriage.

59480,104843,"Just wanted to share my experience with my mother-in-law, because I feel like I need to write this out before I finally close this chapter. Super long, but I hope my story entertains someone at least...
Bluntly speaking, I hate my mother-in-law. I've been married 2 years and it's not gotten better. For context, my husband is Chinese Singaporean and I'm not (my exact race is irrelevant). We dated for a few years before he proposed and all those years, not once did she show me any unkindness. After getting married, while waiting for our BTO, we moved in with her first (supposed to be for just 10 months, and we only lasted 2 weeks).
She'd wake me up at 8am for no reason at all, except ""Daughter in law should be awake before parents in law. No need do anything, just be awake."" Meanwhile, my husband would sleep in. She bought me my own hamper because she said ""*my race* needs to be separated from her family -- who are all Chinese"". Whenever I'd eat food, she'd take photo and send my mom, and say ""This isn't a Chinese diet. No wonder she's getting fat"". And many other stories. So, 1 week in, we started quietly looking for a room to rent. When she found out, she said really crude things like... I was stealing her son away / I must've fed him nasi kang kang to brainwash him, etc. Then she texted my parents, ""I regret letting your daughter marry my son.""
That day itself, we moved back with my family instead -- slept on my parents' couch for 2 weeks until we found a place to move in to. My MIL continued sending harassment messages. Like, would tell my husband ""I'll beat her up when you're not at home."" It was too much.
I've kept myself generally low contact. I can't bear to call her, Mom, and after all the insults she's hurled at me - These take the cake:
1. For Guo Da Li and Si Dian Jing, she said I didn't need to receive it because I'm not Chinese anyway. But whenever she asks for things, she said I must give it because I'm marrying Chinese now.
2. I asked her, why she was so kind all the years I was a girlfriend. She said, even if I was his girlfriend for YEARS, it would be okay. But marriage means I must become Chinese. The man must always be followed.
3. She visited us once and I was scrubbing the toilet floor while my husband was wiping the fridge (chores day), then she scolded me for making her poor son clean. WTF.
4. My family paid for the wedding and she got more than half of the tables - she said my family providing for me is the reason I'm so spoiled, and dont know how to spoil her son instead. During the wedding, my parents, my father in law, all went around taking photos and stuff. She refused to greet people because she had no escort -- her wedding or what?? People commented about her, and our wedding photos has pics of her frowning, looking sleepy, playing phone games... and she says we never give her face??
5. But finally... last night, my grandfather (who was visiting us) had a seizure. My husband updated his parents, and instead of sympathy she told me to ""throw"" my grandparents back to my mom instead. I told her she had no sympathy, and she said ""So what?"". I've decided to cut her off. I blocked her on social media and messaging apps.
She's been calling my husband non-stop and insulting me, my upbringing, and is telling him, she regrets giving birth to him, and if he doesn't go back to her soon, she will jump off their HDB flat.
There's so many more things but I can't type them all. I'm tired. Is it wrong if I just genuinely dont care? I dont know how much disrespect I have to take.

59428,104740,"AITA for asking a NS man to stand in the MRT?
ok, so I posted this on AITA a while back but got ripped apart, prob cus of culture differences, so I’m posting here to have a more understanding viewpoint, please be kind and give your honest but fair opinions. :)
I’m from Singapore. In Singapore, all men aged 18-20, with some exceptions/delays, must do their duty and serve national service for 2 years.
A majority of these men live out on some of the islands surrounding Singapore, in camps, where they do jobs to aid in the defence or functions of our country.
These men used to live out there for the full 2 years, with some breaks in between, but now because ppl were complaining they come back into the city every weekend.
These men often use the public transport on Fridays and Sundays, as they book out of their camps on Friday nights, or evenings and return on Sundays.
I have bfs who’ve served NS, respectfully and dutifully, and my father did it too, when it was much harder, and he never complained.
A “tradition” or unspoken rule is that NS men do not sit down on public transport. First reason for this is that they are bearing the coats of arms of our country, second reason is that they’re meant to be serving our country and a lot of people believe they shouldn’t even be out and about in the first place.
The last reason is that they’re men in their physical prime, meaning they can easily be able to stand for a while.
In more recent times these men have been forgetting themselves, and have began to say they deserve to sit because they actually stand for this country. I think that is bullshit because they’re meant to be serving our country, not sitting on their lazy asses.
So I saw a man sitting on friday, full on decked out in army uniform, on his phone while many women and children and elderly were standing. I walked up to him and tapped him on his knee.
At first I was polite, trying to say there were people who needed his seat more, but he was being a baby saying his legs were sore and “dead”. I reasoned with him some more but eventually just demanded that he get up, citing all the reasons above.
People started staring and pulling out their phones, and I pointed out that he had his name on his chest, so he got up and just walked out of the train.
I told my friends about this, and most agreed that I did the right thing and he should’ve stood, but some of my male friends are refusing to talk to me now.
AITA?

However, I have seen her demolish an entire spring chicken alone in her room.
One time, when another girl screamed at a cockroach in her room, she marched in like Ghengis Khan and whacked at it with her broom while letting out a manly roar. A few days later when it was her turn with a cockroach, and a guy happened to be around, she let out the most high-pitched shriek ever and clutched the back of the guy's shirt like a little girl while begging him coquettishly to help her.
I thought she might have split personality disorder, but she also seems to suffer from Parkinson's disease around guys, as she's forever dropping things and bending over in front of them. Should I encourage her to see a doctor or a psychiatrist?

59496,104865,"TLDR: Found out fiancé and his fam are planning to get me pregnant
Admin pls don’t filter this, I don’t have anyone to turn to, not even my parents. Trying to keep this short, am in my mid 20s, fiancé in his mid 30s. I enjoy being with him alot. We’ve been tgt for long and l made it clear from the start that I only wanted a child at 30, which he agreed to. Why at such a late age is because I wanted to continue studying after Uni. At present, I’ve gotten my masters and am very contented with my job. Not long after I graduated, fiancé proposed and I noticed some changes. The topic of kids started becoming more frequent. From “see how cute xx’s babies are” to “what will u do if u suddenly got pregnant? You won’t abort the baby right?” Whenever his nephew and niece visited, his parents started joking that I should pop out a playmate for them soon.
A few weeks ago, fiancé drove out to get dinner while I stayed in his room to finish a report on his computer. It’s my fault, I opened his desktop WhatsApp out of curiosity, just wanting to see who he was texting. I totally take the blame at this part. Everything seemed fine until I saw my name mentioned by his dad. I clicked the convo, and it was them exchanging links on how to get a woman pregnant inconspicuously. His dad wrote that he’d done something similar with his mom and she never regretted having more kids than she originally intended so “(my name) will be thankful next time”
I tried to minimise interaction with his fam after that, but still kept things usual. They’ve treated me with a lot of love and kindness, even offering to buy a condo for us when we got engaged. When I brought this issue up with my mom, she echoed the same sentiments that I should have a child as early as possible. She didn’t think there was much to it since fiancé and his fam are generous and well to do, so I’d have a comfortable life. When I talked to my dad, he didn’t support their actions but also advised me it was “dangerous to wait too long”. Right now I’m extremely wary when having sex with fiancé, which he has been requesting more of, in case he tries to pull anything funny. Have hinted and reminded him that I’d like another 4/5 years in the corporate world before having a child, but he brushes it off, jokingly saying that he’s more than ready to be a dad and take care of us, and his family also want to help raise our kids.
I’m not sure how to feel about this situation. I’m furious that no one is taking me seriously or respects my wishes. But I’m also scared to appear demanding and overreacting, with how people are downplaying the issue. I definitely don’t want to lose my fiancé because I still love him. This issue aside, I’ve always viewed him as my ideal partner in life, from looks, personality, charm and intelligence. It’s just that because of our age difference, while he has scaled the corporate ladder and feels comfortable settling down, I’m only just starting out. I wish I could go back in time to stop myself from going through his messages. Am I being selfish for wanting more time before having a child?

I did not question him then, but when I researched myself, I found out that these people are like men's rights activists and are quite misogynistic.
I would consider myself a feminist, so I brought up his YouTube history with him, and he says he just watches it ""for fun"". Idk if this is true, or will he abuse me or something in the future. So far, he has never been physical with me and has been quite nice. We do have occasional arguments, but he would apologise later.
But I do notice lately that he has been less gentlemanly compared to when we first started dating. Like previously he would always pay for our dates, and sometimes I would offer to split, but he never would let me pay. But nowadays, often he actually accepts when I offered to pay half. I mean, I know I shouldn't expect him to pay for all our dates, but I just felt disappointed how he treated me so well before, but he changed after getting comfortable with me. I feel like those videos are making him less gentlemanly.

hi guys, i need some advice regarding some work issues im facing. im currently interning in a singapore-based mnc and they continually refuse to process my resignation. what should i do?
context: i have been in this role for a little over a year, and i currently see no point in staying. at the start of the orientation, they promised us that we would have a good, meaningful experience and learn a lot during our time here. however, when orientation about the job actually begun, i saw what a lie that was. the direct superiors of the interns were power-hungry and aimed to take advantage of us, knowing that we were new. they overloaded us with tasks throughout the day and gaslighted us when we made the smallest mistakes, even when they were the ones at fault.
i switched departments and it wasnt any much of a difference. there was constant office politics, with people wanting to outdo each other no matter the cost to get a promotion. my superior even made us come in on saturdays to 'do what we were supposed to do' and meet his kpis. there wasnt any proper handover procedures in place, and we had to learn things from scratch as the employees who were leaving refused to contact the company again. as our department is facing manpower issues, we sometimes have to stay awake throughout the night for a few nights a week as well to do our tasks. to make things worse, the company is facing financial issues and isnt looking to increase our salaries, which is already below market pay. as im not learning much in this role anyway, and this industry doesnt align with my degree prospects, im looking to resign.
however, my superior and managing director of the division constantly refuses to acknowledge my resignation, saying im required to continue my internship 'by law' and 'its only two years'. ive talked to my MP before, but it doesnt help that my MP has connections with the company and was once managing director of another sister company, refusing to help out with my problem.
any advice on what i should do?

During last semester me and my bestie would always hang out at their room. At the start idk why but I just felt a spark, idk maybe he’s just my type, I just feel very happy when I’m with him.
Okay so here is the issue… I actually have a bf that is still in army that I met in poly. The thing with my bf is, he was the one who pursued me, at the start I already told him I don’t really like him, but he kept pursuing so in the end we got together. Actually everything so far with him is ok lah. He is very dependable, very nice actually, its just that sometimes I find him a bit too nice. Its like whenever we get into a fight, and actually it was my fault, but because I’m very stubborn, in the end he will still just come and apologise, even when he did nothing wrong lol. I just find him to be too nice already, until I feel its abit of a turnoff.
But for Z, he is the type of guy that is not scared to tease and talk cock with people (even girls), the type that can joke around one. Plus he is a very good texter, so I would usually text him some stuff about work or even like emotional stuff and he replies well, unlike my bf who is so dry in his replies (idk if this is considered emotional cheating?) But its not like I send anything explicit its just that I feel my bf doesn’t really understand me but Z can really relate. Its like whenever we meet, my bf will just go on a long rant about his army stuff that I have no idea wad he talking. But with Z, the stuff we talk about is like uni related.
But the problem is, at the start, Z told our groupmate that he is interested in my bestie. When I heard that I was damn sad, so I asked my bestie what she thought of Z, she say not her type. That was when I thought maybe got chance. But again the issue is, by right I’m not single, and idk if Z likes me or not.
Recently, I heard Z got quite close to another girl in a different clique, I overheard her name and went to his Instagram to stalk her. Wah, I see they go on walks together with his dog, almost like couple like that. But idk leh, whenever my groupmate tease Z if he got gf, Z will be dodgy about it, (so idk if they are actually together??)
There have been so many times where I wanted to confess to Z, but im so scared ppl will say im a h*e, got bf still look for guys etc. I mean my bf is really a nice guy, but he doesn't give me the thrill that Z gives.
Thinking back, if Z didn’t like my bestie in the first place, I would probably have broken up with my bf long ago. Then now maybe I won’t have this conflict…

Hi everyone, I would appreciate your thoughts on this small matter.
I was with my boyfriend at macs. When he came back to the table with the food, I troubled him to get a curry sauce, and he replied saying the staffs are busy. But still, he went over to the counter.
After close to 10 mins, he wasn’t back so I walked over and saw him waiting with other customers infront of the counter. He then went to the self-order machine, and wanted to order nuggets. I saw and I went forward and asked him why, and he said he wanted to buy to get the curry sauce.
Upon hearing that, I could feel myself boiling so I told him to go back first. There was a staff preparing orders at the counter so I went forward to ask and the staff passed me the curry sauce.
After I went back, we ate and admitted that we were unhappy about this. He felt that the staffs were busy and I still asked him to get the sauce. For me, I felt unhappy because I couldn’t understand why he wanted to buy extra nuggets to join the queue to get the curry sauce. Why couldn’t he just ask the staff at the counter? I know he didn’t want to trouble the staffs as they were busy, but I just felt angry at that moment.
I told him I’ll post here to get some thoughts, so feel free to comment and let me know what do you think of this small matter over a curry sauce, thanks.

59550,104974,"to the OP of #104926
so hey guess who read your post? thats right its your skinny bf. sorry for the fact that im not hunky like other guys put there but as you know i have to juggle between school and work, then there’s you, so there is hardly any time to work out.
i can’t believe that after all the things i did for you, you’d have the audacity to even consider hooking up with one of your hall mates regardless whether you did or didn’t. i work my ass off after school to pay for our dates, buy your designer apparels and bags to the point i only eat two meals a day, which consists of either bread or a simple rice with vegetables, and this is what i get in return.
i scrimp and save just so i can provide you with the things you desire, to the point i can’t help but get a tad bit envious when i walk by Starbucks only to catch a glimpse my friends enjoying their cold brew when all i can afford is a cup of kopi-c. i have never complained or showed you how tired and stressed out i am over this because i really love you and want the best for you, then again, you had thoughts of cheating.
it irks me when i realised im dating someone who i eventually plan to marry develop such obscene thoughts towards other men so i have decided to initiate a break up after leaving this message here. congrats on being free and good luck with those men who are only after your body Agnes L**, tbh you aren’t that good looking yourself lmfao so no idea where u got that self confidence from haha.
cheers.

59511,104887,"I know I'm going to sound shallow and get roasted but I'm going to say it anyway.
Secretly I hate lazy and fat people. If you're lazy and not fat I won't find it as annoying. But I really cannot stand fat people. Those who are so fat that they need a motorized wheelchair to move around. I also hate fat youngsters. You got no excuse to eat till your face swell to double the size and look more pregnant than a woman.
I'm in my 30s and I find it ridiculous that some friends my age cannot control their weight. Please don't give the excuse about body type or medical when you have no health issues. I have friends who managed to look the same or even start to take care of themselves after having kids. So I don't believe its acceptable to look like a balloon after NS. Diet and exercise plays a huge part for sure. Not caring about these 2 elements just shows that you're lazy.
I have a cousin who was fit during his teenage years. NS improved his shape but he got fatter and fatter after that. Always eat junk food and smoke and drink. I was so shocked to see him recently as he haven't been updating his fb posts for years. He has ballooned to triple his size. His fiance is normal built I wonder how does he not crush her to death when they have sex or if he can even make it stand? His face is so swollen I don't even know where to look when I talk to him. He's literally panting and breathing very hard even while he's seated. Not like he's on a treadmill. And he's not even half way through his 20s.
I wouldn't be able to not do anything about it if I looked like him.
Waiting for fat people to slam me. But I'm stating a fact. If you let yourself get to such a stage and do nothing about it, be prepared to hear remarks from people.

59579,105038,"Seen a couple of posts in this page talking about boyfriends having close female friends. But still posting this in attempt to clear my mind and hopefully get some good advice.
My bf of 1 yr+ has a close female friend from uni days, B. My bf said they only meet once every few months and don’t communicate often other than to arrange meetups. He did tell me whenever he meets B, but never asked me to tag along or intro me to her before. At first, I never questioned their relationship and trusted my bf that it’s purely platonic. I thought since B seems happily married for few years already, unlikely anything will happen.
However, recently my gut feeling tells me something’s sus about them. A few things that happened:
- These days, almost every time we meet, I catch my bf texting B. She’ll tell him little things like what she eats, her travel plans, ask for his opinion on house purchase (my bf is not in real estate industry btw) etc. And he replies her immediately even while he is tgt with me eating / watching shows. Whereas he usually takes hours to reply my texts.
- For my bf’s bday this year, B bought him a lavish gift and she even drove over to his house to pass him the gift and bday cake at midnight. Isn’t that too much for a normal guy friend that you got no feelings for?
- My bf is damn lazy to dress up but he will put in effort to look nice for B. Once I went out with him before he met B, and he purposely went home early to change before meeting her. He said it’s because the place they’re dining at has smart casual dress code. He never even brought me to such places before!
- Once I was unwell and alone at home on a Sat night and asked him to come over, but he went ahead to meet B for dinner instead, saying he felt bad to cancel. Before the dinner, we talked on the phone and had a little argument about priorities. He got angry and asked me why must I be so unhappy with him meeting B on a Sat night, when B’s husband is perfectly fine about it? Which is totally out of point. He didn’t even ask me how I’d settle my meal or how I was feeling. In fact he ghosted me from the time they met until late afternoon the next day. I was so upset and hurt.
I want to know if these things my bf and B did are normal, or should I really be worried about these two? Wild thoughts are running in my head right now, thinking what if they used to hook up in the past. Or could he have chased her in the past but got friendzoned, and now both catching feelings again…..
Also need advice on how to communicate my insecurity to my bf without sounding unreasonable and making him turn defensive.

59588,105043,"AITA?
I was earning around 60k to 70k per annum for 10 years before quitting to be a sahm. My husband earns more than me. My husband and I paid half each during the initial payment for the house with a remaining loan of 200k. We have separate and joint accounts. He has taken over paying for almost all the expenses for both of us. Including giving me an allowance which I was able to save from it too. We are thrifty, we don't own a car.
During the course of our marriage, he had asked me twice if we can repay some of the home loan, using both our savings. I've obliged as I wanted to ease his burden. I've not need to spend from my own pocket as he's given me a supplementary card for all expenses and he also paylah whenever I pay for things. From kid to house stuff and even my own personal shopping, insurance and other smaller bills he would paylah me sometimes and will do it when I ask too. Basically he's paying for almost everything and I'm grateful for that. I'm also a simple person. I used to buy Chanels and Pradas but have since adjusted my spending habits since becoming a mom. I can live on 500 or less a month if I want to. I don't scrimp when it comes to food. I can buy things on sale but I also won't deprive my child of a new book or toy on birthdays or xmas when my child asks for it.
We won a decent amount not long ago and we used that to fully repay our condo. We are debt free since. We didn't tell anyone about it.
Recently his family member asked if we can invest an amount in their business. Promising huge returns. All along I'm not on good terms with them and I don't trust them either. They have been changing what they do all along. My husband would like us to contribute to show support. He say I got the spare cash, why not? I have a strong feeling their business will fail again and we won't get back single cent. My relatives said me and my husband are the only ones staying in condo, we should give others a chance to upgrade from hdbs. I think it's rubbish talk.
I don't want my husband to help them either. I have plans to work when my child gets older but whatever I have now, it's my own savings. I feel very annoyed his relatives act like I ought to help them. I'm not a big investor so I prefer to keep most of my money in banks. I do share and invest in the same stocks as my husband so even though my husband don't really know the exact amount that I have, he has a rough idea that I have more than 100k. I know its not a lot. But since I'm not working right now, it's my lifeline.
AITA for refusing to give his relatives a single cent and also stopping my husband from helping them?

My gf has always portrayed herself as someone innocent, those girls you'd imagine who never had s*x (I have never either) and we've never really engaged in dirty talks much because of religion.

Her being someone who keeps secrets would never tell me, but I went further to snoop on her phone (I messed up big time and I take responsibility for my actions).
Upon snooping I found her she has been talking dirty with this girl BFF over a guy she dated back in 2019 and she was saying stuff like ""we study diff stuff. We study on the bed "",""I'm wet downstairs, xxx loves to lick my below"".
It has changed my whole perspective of her and I see her in a different light. I can't help but think - has she actually done anything with these guys all along when she said she haven't? How do I confront her about it? I don't want to be lied to in a rs and had she been upfront about her body count (if any), I would have been fine.

As a result, our family finances are badly affected, e.g. our june family vacation had to be cancelled and the COE on my car will not be renewed. Should I still keep quiet about the mistress or is it time for me to do something about it?
Also, another related question: Whenever the mistress is hospitalised, my father always likes to spend the night at the hospital with her.

THE CORNERS OF HIS HOUSE HAVE A LOT OF SPIDERS AND THEIR WOBWEBS AND I'M AFRAID OF SPIDERS AF. Like deathly afraid - will jump up, shriek, and run. My family has always been helping kill them... and from young till now, I have never managed to kill one myself. The last time I found one in my room and no one was around, I ran out of the house until my brother came back to kill it.
Where he is from and raised, he doesn't care about animals/insects and respects them - only killing them when truly necessary if they are pests (such as cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes). Other insects he will catch and release. He allows spiders to stay in the house as he believes they will keep mosquitoes and flies away by eating them.
So now I'm at a conundrum...he knows I'm afraid of spiders and has been trying to convince me that they are good but I can't...at the same time he won't clear the spiders as he says without them, there were a lot of mosquitoes...
It seems kinda lame but our relationship is now at an impasse cause of...spiders. A bit desperate for some advice!

10am - 1pm - Clinical work
1pm to 2pm - Lunch (if you’re lucky to have time)
2pm to 3pm - Lunch duty (dispensing/processing prescriptions)
3 to 530pm - continuing clinical work. May have 1-2 meeting sometimes
530pm onwards - continue clinical work if didn’t manage to finish.
730pm - Finish clinical work.
730pm to 830pm onwards : Do non-clinical portfolio work such as manage inventory, billing, projects, writing workflow, planning roster. Planning recreational activity for department-.- etc etc
915pm: reached home
930pm: finish dinner
930-10pm: do some chores
10pm - 11pm: continue work that can be finish at home. Such as preparing slides for clinical discussion with students / other faculty members.
11pm: sleep.
Nightshift maybe 2x a year.
Weekends: work either Saturday or Sunday for 6hours.
9am - 3pm: No lunch break. So most of us work with an empty stomach and start to develop chronic gastric issue.
Free time on weekend: continue non-clinical portfolio work. Pray no one contact you on weekend to reprimand on your clinical mistake / ask you clinical questions/ ask to cover duty for someone at work. Most people lives in fear because of above.
*** FYI no extra pay if covering work for ppl.
Hardly any family time. Maybe just 2h per week? At most 4h per week?
Clinical work means but not limited to:
1) medicine reconciliation
2) reviewing of patients to ensure all medications are restarted or stop when necessary.
3) Verify medication orders to ensure Drs order appropriate medication for the condition
4) process Prescription
5) Answer Drug related query by healthcare team
6) etc etc etc
All in all:
1) No work life balance.
2) Super high workload.
3) Super low pay (less than 2K for fresh grad doing training), after 1 year average low - mid 3K (depend on class level ^ 2nd lower and below)
4) super super difficult to have annual leave approved. Even if approve is just a couple of days here and there. So cannot go oversea with friends or family
Not a place for ppl who wants to be rich. Unless you don’t care about money and just want to save life.

59582,105031,"Re: #104917 Some startup advice you might find useful.
1. Coming from someone who did take Softbank's check in a past life: don't feel bad that you missed it. On hindsight, we took them too early and it sounds like you'd have too. At the stage you're at, it's so much more important to diversify your active investor base. I've seen many friends' businesses fail because they brought on a large brand name fund who didn't add any value besides cash.
2. For an early founder, an inactive or non-activist investor might seem great because it will take heat off you. But over time I've come to realize that active investors are better if they can be at the right level of ""active"". One problem with large funds is that they tend to be inactive investors and needlessly occupy up a useful board seat.
3. My last two rounds were oversubscribed over 4x, and we turned down marquee funds like Tiger Global, Sequoia etc. I liken building a round to assembling an MMORPG raid party:
- Get 1-2 lead investors.
- Get 1-2 follow-on anchors that can potentially lead a follow-on round. These are usually larger than the lead of your current round, but are just piggybacking off your lead investor's due diligence.
- Get 1-2 ""utility"" investors, who provide some hands-on like customer referrals, recruiting, or actual business advice. These are often micro-VCs, because you're their most important portfolio company, or because their partners were recent founders themselves. It's nice if this happens to be your lead investor(s) too, because then you have a useful board member.
- Get an investor that validates your business model, e.g. had a highly publicized exit in a similar segment.
- Get 1-2 investors who are target customers and can give product feedback. You might be able to find a good board member from this group too.
- Get 2-3 cheerleaders, who will always vote in your favor. One might be a good board member.
4. One of the best investors in my career had less than $80M AUM, because we mattered more than everything else in their portfolio - and they worked nearly as hard as a full time employee to help us succeed - and in turn we singlehandledy 10x'ed their portfolio. Another investor helped us build our network stack. Another investor had no brand name, but saved us about 1/3 as much in cash as they invested because they had free office space in Menlo Park.
5. I trust you will become a multi-millionaire and realize many of the plans you listed. When it happens, I don't recommend an instant lifestyle creep on how you spend on others (family trip, donation) when you do.
6. This may seem counterintuitive, but the most effective investment of the first $1-10M is to splurge on ways to keep your body nourished that seem like lifestyle excesses. Think of it this way: if your company is burning >$2M of cash per month, a $40k first class flight on your 1 week vacation is often worth it because it will keep your mind that 4% more nourished over the next 2 weeks. To begin, the decisions you'll make cumulatively in those 2 weeks have >25x notional value compared to that flight. But more importantly, a 4% improvement in decisionmaking is a lot - it probably has an effect of 40% notional value.
7. Other examples of things I found useful to spend the first $10M on: custom house with more guest space; multiple fridges and dishwashers; better bedding; extra condos around the areas where I have the highest probability density; spare cars that I leave at a few destination airports; a personal assistant; private chef; biweekly massages; storage space to clear the clutter; landscaping services; multiple identical copies of travel gear; identical copies of gym gear etc. $10M is a small amount, and these things add up fast. But it's hard to make the next $100M unless you spend on these things.
8. Spend a lot on minimizing variance. Been there and done that and a fluctuating sleep schedule is not something to be happy about because of point 6: it means you're making decisions maybe just that 1-4% worse through the week. I used to stay overnight before every exam so pulling all-nighters came naturally to me, but I saw a steep drop-off in my ability to pull an all-nighter after 27. For example, you can achieve lower variance (and better sleep) by flying your personal assistant out to every place a day before you so he/she can arrange everything in the room the way you want it ahead of time.
9. Alternative asset classes (HF, PE, angel group etc.) take up substantial mental energy and opportunity cost. The amount of effort to manage your taxes for 1 angel investment might exceed the amount you're investing. As boring as it sounds, when I got my first big liquidity event, I had so much cash for two years that I was gradually TWAP'ing into one boring index ETF position by the millions.
I hope none of this advice comes across as patronizing. 60+ in 3 years is better than I had managed at my first stint - so you must be killing it! Keep it up and I wish you all the best.
P.S.: I also wrote #104647 and #104658, which you might find helpful.

59469,104820,"I've been dating my gf for a year. Before we got together, she gave me the impression she's a person who loves to exercise, eat well, and takes great care of herself. She doesn't drink or smoke. Doesn't eat junk or processed food too. She moved into my place 4 months ago and I find she doesn't seem to be what she says she is.
She fills the kitchen with chips and chocolates. She orders korean alcoholic drinks in cartons and has more than a can every night. The freezer is full of frozen fried food, sweet drinks, snacks and ice cream. She tells me when it's that time of the month she will have craving for these kind of food. I can accept it but that time of the month can't possibly be everyday? She's snacking and drinking everyday while watching k drama. Then she will have craving to have korean instant noodles as supper at the same time.
She used to be dressier in the beginning and would deck out in colors that suit her but now she wears full on black everyday and it really doesn't sit well on my eyes. It's like she's ready to go to a funeral anytime. I'm a visual person and I also make effort to look good for her. I still go for regular haircuts and I still cycle and lift weights. I brush my teeth before I kiss her but she doesn't. She doesn't bother about her appearance anymore and I've not seen her exercise for months. I find myself getting increasingly frustrated at home while I'm with her.
I still love her but I find that she's very different from when we started to date. Is this how it's like living together? I haven't even talk about chores. There are some chores that she refuses to do and she said it's my place after all, so I'll have to be the one to do it. I think I'm covering 80% chores while she's only keen in doing 20%. She has the habit of leaving washed underwear in the toilet and I would have to be the one to take it out to hang because she would forget and ask me to do it instead. There's many other instances that she would forget to do something and I would be the one finishing the chore. I cannot imagine doing this long term.
When I try to talk about it she would get upset and binge snack and drink. I'm not even arguing with her. It's just talking in a calm tone.

59569,105012,"tldr; AITA when my bf half-cancels on our staycay to attend a friend’s wedding and i’m upset about it?
we booked a staycay in early aug for the last weekend of aug, and this week he just got invited to his friend’s wedding. also, he is unable to bring a +1 as the friend said there are not enough seats. he said that he’ll be going on saturday from 6pm onwards so i’ll be alone all the way until midnight-ish in the room. he said he’ll come back after that and spend the night with me.
Firstly, he accepted the friend’s invite so late minute, and that he did not care about how I’d feel being left alone in the room for half a day when this is supposed to be our staycay. It’s like damn sus for a close friend to send an invitation so last minute. & I don’t think he respects my time and treats me like an option. I’ve turned down my friends’ or family’s invites to go out on that particular weekend because we got our staycay booked. But I don’t think he understands that this is basic respect.
I won’t be upset at all if his friend invited him before we made plans and I won’t stop him from going at all. I just find it very disrespectful for half-canceling on me we agreed to spend the weekend together beforehand. He made it seem like I’m making mountains out of molehills as he’ll be coming back after that.
AITA for being mad about this? Should I be more understanding and cincai to wait in the room for him lol? Please advise. Thank you!

However, she doesn’t really have a attractive body (a little chubby and small breasts) and I find it to be quite a turn off.
Whenever I see other girls with a nice body walk by me, I can’t help but wonder how it is like to have s*x with them. I know it’s wrong of me to think like that but deep down I just feel like I want to find a hotter girl to satisfy my temporary desire….

They started this affair about one month before the wedding banquet but had ROM prior to that. He says his love for me was already draining out before the affair happened. I did my best in this relationship for him and us. In the end this was the result. He says that I’m naggy and annoying. I agree to that but that’s because I care and that’s the way I show my love. Now at this point, I’m actually thinking of a divorce. He says that he will think it through and see who he wanna be with. What do you guys think? At the brink of turning mentally insane.

59427,104738,"My boyfriend and I were together for 2 years before we broke up. The reason for the break up was mainly because he wanted to set up a business on his own and don't have time even for himself. Another reason is that I'm really immature and easily stressed out. He had always been there for me but I didn't because I used to think that my ""stress"" was a lot for me.
Some context when we were still together:
We were a very loving couple and are always together because we just prioritize each other. He loved me a lot as well by pampering me and treating me like a princess. Due to this, I get angry and mad easily. This year, during Valentine's day, we agreed to meet after his lesson for a while. On the day itself, he told me that Oh he couldn't make it because he suddenly remembered that he has to attend some group project and that we had to cancel the meet. I got really furious and I was so mad so he came to me eventually. I know.. I know I'm being very unreasonable and now that I recall about this incident, I just had that I couldnt think for him. So there were many instances like that.
We started arguing a lot when internship started for the both of us and eventually we call it quits.
During this month that we've broken up, I have been reflecting on my wrongdoings.
A few days back we texted and he said I could text him like usual and he would reply whenever possible (as he is busy with his work). We chatted like usual and he opened up to me saying that he couldn't function normally after the breakup and that when we were still together, I was the only able to calm him down and helped his insomnia. He told me he hasn't been sleeping for days and is also having a high fever while he has to deal with his work.
I became very worried and suggested to be there for him (like chit chats and stuffs as he doesn't want me to come over). So I talked to him about my things so at least there is someone there for him and eventually he would open up about his stresses. I lied to him saying that I've moved on because it hurts to see him suffering (due to the break up) and honestly I want him to move on as well. I tried to keep the conversation casual and try to sound cheerful but most of his replies are just. ""Okay"" ""Mmm"" and I understand that he is going through a lot but it just got a little disappointing and draining for me as I don't know if I'm bothering him or if I came off as 'needy'. I started asking him about it and I said it's fine that I can stop talking but he always replied with ""I'll reply when I see"" so I just continued sharing about my day. I don't expect him to reply immediately like he can take a day or so to reply but his reply are so dry and eventually I was so done and I told him I'm going overseas to study because I don't want to stay at the same place as you. We argued, and that's the end of it.
I'm still worried about him and I miss him but I really couldn't take his half hearted replies without feeling that I'm shamelessly texting him..
Any advice please?

Telling her about the incident one fine evening Afew months into our marriage started sowing the seed of jealousy and I never saw it coming. My wife is loving, gentle and relentless in keepin up with “family image”.
I only realised my horror one fine day when we were shopping for a toy for our niece and she suggested Pokémon soft toys. I politely insisted that littles girls loves frozen princess and she went ape shit crazy on how I can’t give up my past and she is just a replacement.
Long story short, I brought a singing frozen princess and gave away the soft toy to some random neighbour in goodhood.sg (doing some good in the process and received some rescued bananas too!)
Now that the toys are given away, she has acted like it never happened. Pls advice if I need to bring her for some therapy as I’m very traumatised by this split personality. Sincerely thank u

59543,104954,"I saw a post on the day of the life of a teacher previously and would like to share mine as an Architect.
A typical day for me:
Wake up: 7.45am
Get ready, take public transport to work
Reach office: 9am
Attend meetings, do drawings, answer email.
Lunch: 1pm
Continue to attend site meetings, do more drawings and 3d modelling till 6.30pm.
Go for dinner near office and return to work: 7.30pm
Being able to actually do work after a whole day of meetings till 9.30pm
Reach home around 10.15pm.
Shower and relax, sleep around 12.30am.
On days of submission we can OT till about 11pm to 1am. This is quite a norm in our industry and as more of my colleagues quit in despair, the workload is passed on to those that remain in the firm. It would take months before a new hire comes in.
I don't really see a future in this as it is clearly unsustainable. Most of the seniors and supervisors in their late 30s to 40s are unmarried and lead the same lifestyle. They are disgruntled but unable /unwilling to pivot to other industries.
On top of the heavy workload, the pay is quite sad too. We spent an extra year getting a masters, yet the pay range is about the same as a normal honours grad and the increment is very much slower than any other industry (looking at 200 to 400 every 2 years). Whats worse is that most firms do not give AWS, and bonuses are scarce (not every year). We have raised this to the firm but they are pretty cash strapped after covid and can't do anything about it.
Having worked for 5 years in the industry, I feel that it is time to throw in the towel. It is kinda sad, thinking back about all the hardwork we put in school and countless OT days in the job. But the hard truth is that the lifestyle and pay is no longer sustainable, despite liking the work I do. ""Passion"" is a word thrown around in this field whenever the firm doesn't want to compensate us fairly. (most of us would roll eye to that). Looking forward, I am scared to become what my seniors have become, lifeless zombies that do not have a life beyond work, or a family and savings.
I feel uncertain about the future, as do my entire batch. We often gather to discuss whats there for us and those who have left all agreed that it was the best decision they ever made. To my juniors, please talk to more people in the industry and learn more skills beyond architecture, just in case you want to make a u-turn. To my seniors, I do hope that you can give some advice and personal experience about staying on in the industry and your thoughts. Thanks.

Just got my first dose of workplace bullying today. It was from someone way older at a better division.
The person intentionally spelt my name into a cursed word that is ominous especially during the 7th month for Chinese and replied super rudely to my emails. She also kept spam calling my extension number until I start doing the stuff she emailed me (everything crucial and necessary was missing too).
This was all just to spite me because I didn’t reply on 9 Aug and was prioritizing the really important/urgent things to be done today. Hers wasn’t urgent.
Is there anyway to handle this? I will probably see her a lot in the future too. I foresee myself staying in my first job for at least 2 years since I get lots of useful experience and exposure.

59570,105013,"My partner is too nice. He is nice to me and also to everyone around him. He is someone that is easily convinced by anyone and easy to be taken advantage of. So at his workplace, coworkers especially female coworkers like to approach him for help and they like to make small requests like helping them to run errands, takeaway breakfast for them, driving them out for lunch when there are eating places at walkable distance and sometimes dropping them home since it is along the way etc.
I don’t want to be the bad person and ask him to stop helping people. As his girlfriend, my concern here is that he can’t say no and his female coworkers are taking advantage of that. Anyone can influence his opinions. I have tried talking through this with him and usually his reply will be like ""I don't see any issue in this"" and says that’s who he is. We will end up in small arguments because of this.
Due to these small arguments, he chose to ""help"" them out ""behind my back"" instead e.g. bringing them out for lunch or fetching them home and this makes me more annoyed because he don't get my point. I know that he is trying to save some petrol money too so we are meeting up lesser so that he can ""save"" up on his petrol money. Yet, he won't hesitate to bring his female coworkers out for lunch when they requested for it or he will drop them off to their houses directly after work dinner. All these requests are happening on a very frequent basis. He mentioned that he don't want to let me know because he wants to avoid these ""stupid"" arguments.
Also, I don't feel like he prioritizes me more than them. Make it clear first that I don't want him to stop being friends with them. I feel like being his girlfriend just being another one of his coworkers/friends because seems like whatever he is doing for his female coworkers are the same as towards me.
So is it wrong for me to feel annoyed? And to all the females, can you accept your partner being such a pushover/people-pleaser and also often putting his females coworkers/friends' needs first?

She been wanting me to proposal to her and getting our marriage but i feel that currently, we're not ready yet. We've also been quarrelling for even small matters, she always think that she's in the right and i've been purposely finding faults to argue with her.
She always get angry for no reasons. That day her mum asked me to help her buy stuffs and since she said she tired from sch, so i picked her up and send her home first. But she get angry that i didn't told her that her mum asked me to help buy items and she felt that buying those stuffs unnecessary. She argue with me said that i don't bother telling her what's happening and then she throw mine items on the floor, take scissors cut the shirts that i owned. While picking those items she thrown on the floor, she been raising her voice until whole building could heard the arguments.
Sometimes she love to play ""cold wars"" with me for no reasons, suddenly block me for hours/days then don't want pick up any calls/messages. She allergies to crabs so when we eating, she insist of eating crabs but i said no. She angry and then walked/dump me there while we're dinning.
She also angry that i don't share salted eggs potato chips with her when i ordered like a bulk of it and she probably ate like 90% of it and i eat probably like half a packet. Saying how "" I don't love her anymore, don't cherish her anymore after we're dating"". She said how in her family, what she wants to eat n etc, ppl will always ask her, share with her and they don't snatch with her snacks to eat.
So one of the days, i requested her to walks the dog as i was busy with presentation and since for the past few days, it was raining so the dog didn't manage to be out of the house. She said i'm treating her like a maid, asking her to follow my order. She never touched dirty things in her life. for example, when the dog shits. i'm always the one picking up the poops. In her family, she ate alr just dump the plate/bowl at the sink/basin, for someone in her family to wash. She also don't tidy up her room, sweep floors and etc, was always me when i go her house to help her housekeeping her room.
She also have a bad habits of wasting money on unnecessary. She always like to go cinema to watch movies , probably like every week. But i'm the one paying for it since she doesn't have any income. She also rant that i am unlike other ppl bf, buy for their gf accessories.

59614,105101,"This is my first ever post on NUSWhispers and I never wanted to post anything here, but I’m really at a lost.
I have a bf for 3 years+ (Friends for 10 years) and I am someone who believes that it’s okay for people to have opposite gender friends. I have my own male friends and he does have his own female friends too. I guess a difference is that he is still friends with his ex but I’m not in contact with mine.
One day, he told me that he will be out eating supper with his dad. I found it weird because he never eats supper with his dad and it was at an area close by but it still not a walkable distance from his house.
It just so happen that his phone spoiled recently and he was using my spare phone which he returned without resetting. So of course, my instincts kicked in and I checked the phone and I found out that he is going off to eat supper with his ex and he has been deleting his past messages (because I can’t see them) and he archived their conversation so it doesn’t show up on the normal messaging feed.
I was so pissed and I confronted him and asked him why did he do it when I never restricted him in the first place and he told me that it was because I might get angry. And of course I am right what do you expect - you lied to me and actively hide the messages from me. So we had a huge fight and the conclusion was to block off all his exes even though I know it’s not their fault but since he no balls to cut people off I might as well cut off for him. It was either he cut off or we break up.
Fast forward a few months later, he calls me and told me his supper ex called him and want eat supper with him (like wtf?) and asked me if he should meet with her face to face and tell her it’ll be the last time he sees her or if he should do it via the phone. I was like wait hold up, I need to process but of course I still blew up because 1) didn’t we agree to cut off, 2) why are you still considering to speak with her and 3) why can she even call you in the first place?… amongst all other things running through my head
Bottom line is he blocked off social media but number he just deleted. he didn’t think of blocking number at that point in time. And also, that day when we agreed to cut off his contacts, he actually went back to unblock her after he left my house to let her know he’s blocking her then reblocked her again. I seriously didn’t know how to process everything in my head cause I felt like there’s so many things going on at the same time. So I went on a rage bursting out loud on the phone telling him that he broke his promise the moment he stepped out of the door that day, bothered to respect his ex but not me (I feel bad for her actuallybut at the same time I no capacity to give a fuck about her feelings because obviously he’s not giving a fuck about mine), and he’s still trying to find praise that he bothered to do the basic act of informing me about this
So now I don’t know what to do. It’s easy to say that I should break up with him but we’re actually engaged and have (or had) plans to get married, a house and everything already. Plus, he said that if he actually liked her he wouldn’t be with me in the first place and everything he did was because he was afraid I will get angry (which funnily enough, brought us to the verge of destruction).
FYI that girl also never asked why he blocked her on that day and decided to casually call him for supper knowing he is blocked. And also call him by pet names even though they broke up years ago. He keeps saying they are friends. Am I the only one finding her sus :’)

59467,104818,"I (24F) feel like I’m a crazy girlfriend.
Context: My bf (26M) and I are busy with work during the weekdays and we meet only during the weekends. But, we do spend some time at night together like watching series on netflix party but not everyday.
Here’s the problem. Whenever we decided to watch drama or movie, he will take his time to bathe, play his phone games, sometimes even nap. Because of that, we can watch maximum 1 episode or a movie and we will head to sleep cause he say tired, next day he needs to work.
But, when it comes to playing computer games with his friend (girl), he can rush to eat, bathe and play until midnight even though there is work the following day.
He is also to a certain inflexible…? For example, there was once I texted him to do a certain activity with me but his friend (girl) texted him 5 mins earlier to play game. It’s not like he replied her then I ask. He saw both our messages at the same time and told me he’ll play with his friend since she asked first. At that point, I just wish he would prioritize me. To be honest, I feel jealous and I feel that I weigh lesser to him. I want to voice it to him about this but I feel that he will view me as a crazy girlfriend because there was once their friend said she is one of the “boys” and she got a bf too - when his friend’s gf voiced out that she is jealous.
Not sure if my feelings are valid or I’m the crazy girlfriend?
Is there any advice on how not to feel this way or how should I open this topic to my bf without him feeling like I’m the crazy girlfriend…

Just wondering what should i do ? and whether is it okay for companies to deduct our salary.
Should i speak to my intern liaison officer about it ?
It sucks to know that all the company cares is about $ and is already paying us slavery salary

59500,104870,"When I was a teenager, I was quite the ugly duckling. Once, a senior told me I “had a fantastic personality… but that’s it”. I’m quite aware some of my guys friends would have hit on me if I was more feminine and just looked prettier. I had this guy friend of mine who was quite the stud and pretty much the best looking guy in school. Once when I stood beside him during JC, I was in such awe of his perfect features that I almost felt like we don’t deserve to occupy the same space because it magnified my flaws 10x.
Now this “stud” was a pretty good friend of mine, we talked a lot about everything including HTHT secrets what’s not and he called me all the time. Over the years we just went to different schools, he went to army and I got busy with uni, so we lost contact and I didn’t have time to talk to him really. Once I let him give me 15 missed calls in a night.
Fast forward to adulthood, upon an absolutely random encounter I discovered he always liked me and now all the things I thought was because we were “buddies”, was NOT in fact a buddy thing. Then we had a fling, nothing much ensued and we fell out because the fling ruined our friendship.
It’s been like many years. I forgot to mention I’ve grown out of the ugly duckling phase and have aged … pretty well. The most surprising thing about turning 30 was discovering that there is a shocking number of 4-8 years younger men who have a serious thing for older women. (What?!) In the meantime, my stud friend has not done that well aging wise. I am more out of his league than he was mine. However, despite me not having seen him in forever, I can’t tell you how many sexually charged dreams I’ve had of this guy and it’s making me very annoyed and frustrated it makes me want to ring him up and just go fuck him. I’ve dreamt of him 5 times a month all about some sort of rendezvous. Sigh I guess that’s the end of my brain dump. If you think this could be you and you’ve not aged nicely, know someone out there is having wet dreams about you every other week. (We are both still single by the way)

59433,104756,"Dear XY,
When we first met, I was looking for your boss and you took the initiative to stand up from your desk and told me he wasn’t around. At that time, I found you cute looking. After that first encounter, you emailed me after you got to know I was your business partner and we started chatting more via email until you asked me out for lunch one day.
Our interactions increased ever since. It all came to end, or so I thought, when I found out from other coworkers you were engaged. It devastated me and I vowed to reduce interactions with you. You were persistent and kept messaging me when you felt I was withdrawing. So I thought no harm having you as a friend. Boy, was I wrong. We met a few times after that. During one of the meet ups, I remembered we went to a live singing bar. It was then we first held hands, hugged and kissed.
I knew it was wrong but I couldn’t pull away. I was praying that you would break your engagement with your partner. I was so naive back then and I totally disregarded the fact that you seldom replied me during weekends. You even said during one of the meetups that if I still looked as youthful in 5 years time, you would marry me. I was elated and thought there was hope. Our physical interactions were still going on but thankfully we didn’t go full base.
The bombshell came when you invited me to your wedding. It was then it all came crashing down on me that I had been letting you lead me on telling me that it wasn’t a bad thing being a secret third party and I did consider. Well, the mist cleared and I was back to my logical self. I told you I did not want a person who was unavailable when I needed him/her the most.
It took a lot of willpower to walk away and I will be the first to admit that I stumbled a few times before I completely cut off contact with you. Now I have a partner who is available for me 24/7 and stayed with me when I needed him/her the most.
Despite all this, I still wish that you would reach out to me now and we can rekindle the spark. No strings attached because I do not wish to jeopardize my current life.
If you are reading this, I hope you remember there was once this youthful looking girl who looked like she was fresh out of school looking for your boss to sign documents.

59470,104832,"To the Regulars of 16th Mono 5SIR, thank you for killing what little patriotism I have for the country. I will always remember booking out seeing the poor soul who couldn't even bend his knee, doing guard duty, or the time the RSM smashed the guard house window to take out his anger. In the 2 years of training, practicing to shoot, etc., they never tell us who our true enemies are, always the down-pes guys or OPFOR, but thank you, especially *ow *hia* *oh and *im *oo* *in for adjusting my aim, I now know who to train my gunsights on.
