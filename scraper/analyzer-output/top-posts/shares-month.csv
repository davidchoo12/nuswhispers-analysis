61012,108012,"I just got married less than a few months ago. I accidentally saw some screenshots of a sexy influencer on my husband’s phone. I confronted him about it, and he apologised saying that it is habitual. I forgave him and reminded him that he is now married with a wife. For context, we’ve been together almost 10 years before we got married. 
Few days passed, and things went back to normal. But my gut feeling says no. I know it’s bad but i snooped his iphone gallery. I know i’m looking for trouble at this point but I just needed confirmation. The photos are no longer in his gallery, but it’s under the Hidden folder. My heart sank when i saw thousands and thousands of not only screenshots of sexy influencers, but also sneaky photos he took of his friends who are girls. Some butt pics, cleavage. Some of these girls, he went out with without my knowledge after I wished him goodnight, after cross checking the dates of these outings with our past messages. There were also photos of absolute strangers at the gym, on the plane which he sneakily took. While these photos were not recent (like within this year), it all happened within the course of our relationship.
I am very disappointed, hurt and disgusted. Now i am in a dilemma. Do i confront him about it even though it’s mainly in the past (except for the recent ones he screenshotted) and risk our marriage? Because I snooped around without his permission. Or do I close one eye and pretend everything is okay, but knowing he could likely do it again? It’s definitely going to cause trust issues between us both for both scenarios - i can’t trust him anymore with his predatory behaviour, and he can’t trust me coz of my snooping. How do i go forward?

61037,108064,"I’m 35 , male, married with 2 kids.
I met my wife in school when I was 22 and she was 20. 
We dated for 7 years before tying the knot.
Throughout our relationship, I have always thought of her as my future partner because she is what society consider to be an ideal girl. She is smart, pretty, loving, kids-loving etc.
2 years ago,  I started to have some feelings about  my colleague. I feel extremely guilty about it but I cannot control it.
While my wife is great in the eyes of others, I’m lacking this excitement in life. Our conversations are very superficial e.g. what the kids eat, how the kids behave. We don’t delve into topics about my emotions and feelings. 
This colleague of mine is a stunner imo (my friends and colleagues think my wife is way prettier though). We can chat for hours and talk about anything and everything. She feels like my soulmate.
I haven’t cheated physically but I feel like I am already cheating emotionally.
I don’t know if I love my wife romantically anymore, or love her as a friend or whether I have even loved her at all.
What should I do?

61062,108107,"My EX-SO owes me a 5-figure debt and is now ghosting me, what can I do to recoup my money?
I am 25M and just broke up with my 20F. We had been together for ~2 years. When we were together, she was still a student, and as a working adult, I was there to support her (dates were mostly paid for by me). 
Now that she had graduated and transitioned to adult life, she found a job in the design industry. Things were difficult as they work on a comms basis and do not have a fixed salary. Dates were mostly paid for by me until recently she started to fork out some of her own share. 
During the first week of work, she needed a laptop, so I bought a MacBook for her (initially was mentioned to be paid on an instalment basis but I guess she took it as a graduation gift and I as a supportive BF left it as it is). 
She also needed a car to meet clients so she used her family car for work, however whenever she needed money to pump petrol/season parking, she would ask money from me, and I would pay for her. When she decided to lead a healthy and fit lifestyle and wanted to sign up for a gym and asked me to help pay for it, to encourage her, I did.
However, the money I am writing today is not about the money that I have paid for during our time together, but the money she had borrowed for her own needs (e.g., paying off outside debts, and fixing her car, etc). 
Recently we had an argument in which I told her that I felt neglected by her since we only met once every few weeks. After that argument, she basically shut off from me and ghosted me for 2 weeks and I had no choice but to initiate the breakup because we were supposed to go on a family trip together (which I had paid for), but things were so dire that I just wanted a clean break. But when I mentioned the money that she owed, she left me on single tick and did not answer my messages at all. 
Now I just want my money back. I do not care for the money we had spent together during our time; I just want those that she legitimately borrowed from me. 
To be honest, all the money that I have spent on her amounts to much more than this (birthday trips, my dinners, luxury gifts), but I just want those that she had borrowed because it is still not a small amount... 
Please help and give any advice, TIA.

61011,108009,"Hello, I've been dating my partner for 6 years and we haven't had any intimacy after a year. So it's almost 5 years now that we don't touch each other anymore. Recently I found out she cheated on me 1 year ago with a ONS which is very ridiculous as she mention she's not a high sex drive person. That's why we haven't had any sex for so long. I confronted her regarding it and she says she's very sorry. She just wanted to confirm that she got no interest in sex anymore. After all these, my trust in her is lost. I've been asking her whereabouts everyday and who is she with etc. I am slowly losing myself, thinking that I am not attractive to her anymore.. I cried myself to sleep every single day. 
She told me she wants to go to the doctor for her sexual thingy so that she can be fair to me and give me what I wanted/needed. But up until now, she keep say shes busy and don't have the time to go to the doctor. After that, she have not been taking my feelings seriously. Everytime when I mention about the ONS thing which are affecting me, she find it no wrong. She's no longer guilty for doing that to me. She treat it like nothing happen. 
After a few months past, she found a new job and have been really busy. She don't have the time to even reply my message anymore. She's always busy. I have to wait hours and hours for her reply. She only call me when she needed help from me but my messages to her was ignored after that. 
Even when she reach home, she claims she's still busy with work... yet she can post insta stories and reply other people. so I am slowly fading away. I am not waiting for her replies anymore. I don't even wanna bother anymore. I am so tired of this shit relationship. So so tired. 
Can you guys advice what to do? Or do you think she's not interested in me anymore? But why she don't want to just break up with me... everytime when I did that, she begs me to stay. 
I am a lesbian and she's a butch by the way...

61032,108058,"I want to share a bit about my story. I’m a Malaysian,when I was 23 years old, I moved into my boyfriend's house in an old 3-room HDB flat and stayed with his parents. The living room was empty, and his younger brother occupied an extra build corner room.
My boyfriend is an incredibly sweet, kind and positive person. He doted me a lot and ensure I never shed a tear. His personality has endeared him to many people. However, there's a darker side to our situation.
His parents have proven to be quite toxic. They've been verbally abusive towards him and treated him poorly like owe them 100mil. They would scold and shout at him whenever they see him and frequently ask for money. Despite being in their healthy 60s, they refuse to work and spend most of their time in the kitchen smoking. everytime i open the kitchen door I thought the house got burned. 
My boyfriend isn't a high earner,and I’m been financially independent and will try my best to cover our expense. He gives 30% of his salary to his parents. He pays for their bills when they are sick and covers all the household expenses. They seem to have money for cigarettes but none for medical care. There was even an incident where his father used my toothbrush, and another time he entered my room and yelled at me for no reason. His father's behavior even extends to walking around in just his underwear.
I've tried to maintain respect and ignore the nonsense they did to us. As our financial situation has become more stable, I'm eager to move out  but we failed to ballot a HDB flat. My boyfriend is hesitant to consider a resale flat as he only has preference for new flat. We've had many quarrels about this and his toxic parents behaviour. I've endured all of this for years because I love my boyfriend deeply.
Now, I'm in my 30s, and I'm eager to start a family, but we are still stuck in this toxic situation.

61056,108096,"Hi all, just wanted some opinions on this: Would it be better to live in our BTO until retirement and save/invest excess salary in etf/reits/stocks, or buy a new smaller condo and potentially one more to rent out as a form of property investment with significantly lower investment in etf/reit/stocks?
For context, my husband and I are in our early 30s with one kid. We don’t plan to have another kid. 
We are fortunate enough to earn a good income as regular office staff despite not being managers or sales related. In terms of salary we are earning 220-230k annually. Take home after taxes and CPF is 180-190k. In terms of salary growth, we expect it to grow about 4% annually with occasional higher bumps due to promotions.
We do not have a helper and have a family car. 
Our yearly expenses works to be about 80k all inclusive, majority of expenses come from our car ~16k and kid’s enrichment and class ~17k ,8k budgeted to annual holidays, 12k to insurance, 4K for regular bills/utilities and 12k to our parents
BTO is fully covered by CPF at around 2.1k per month. Right now it has fulfilled MOP and we could sell it for 800k, with a net gain of 480-490k to our cash/OA after paying off the remaining housing loan of 300k and deducting agent fees
We save quite a lot as well, our liquid cash/stocks/OA combined is at 600k.
Our initial plan was to stay in this 5rm BTO until retirement and build up a big saving egg/portfolio. However, quite a number of friends in similar financial situation to us have been saying that we are wasting this opportunity that we have to own 1 condo with higher capital appreciation and potentially another studio that can be rented out so that effectively it is paying for itself. I tend to take a more pessimistic view that if the studio is not rented out, our cash flow becomes a problem while my husband is more optimistic about it. In terms of timeline wise, we are quite flexible, but if we were to buy an EC, we would need to do it before the second half of 2024 as our monthly salary will cross the threshold of 16k basic per month.
So I am just putting our situation out here to seek some opinions. Thank you :)

He’s a chivalrous man and I really do like him. He even remembers everything that I have mentioned before (i.e. what I like/dislike, what I’d like to do and etc) and plans all the dates accordingly.
He did mention that he kinda likes me and would like to continue going out with me after our 3rd or 4th date, which I agreed.
Fast forward to our most recent date, he said that he really likes me, but he’s not prepared to commit because I’m looking for a serious relationship that hopefully will lead to a marriage eventually. He says that’s he’s also looking for something serious but not until that extent (marriage) yet.

61067,108118,"I don't feel safe telling this to anyone around me irl so this is just going to be my rant dump.
I've always admired people in consistent ""big"" cliques, e.g they all met in school/poly/jc/uni etc, remained close enough to talk about their lives/share inside jokes inside a group chat, introduce their partners to each other, travel overseas tgt, book huge villas tgt, go to beach clubs, open daybeds tgt without worrying about min. spend (bc there's definitely enough people) etc, and generally just knowing everyone's getting older together. I'm sure it must feel nice to have that same group of friends you can always randomly ask out/ have known you long enough etc. I hope they're aware that they're really lucky to have found a tight-knit, consistent, group of friends that all like each other, naturally, in life.
On the other hand, I have always only been close to 2-3 people MAX. Meaning that in every environment I'm in (school/uni/work), I tend to end up close to 2-3 people there. So I'm usually in a trio, or a 4-person clique where it then (also) becomes a trio, and then as we all get older, we gradually just start chatting 1-1 to each other (since not everyone's free at the same time yknow?), so now most of the time I end up going out with my friends 1-1, and I've to (usually) ask if someone mutual (that knows both of us) would like to join. It is never a consistent ""clique"" and most of the time I'm the one introducing my friends to each other. As the only ""bridge"" in my circle, I sometimes even forget who knows who alr, and they'd be like ""rmb you brought her that one time!!"".
Another factor is the fact that as we all got older, everyone around me slowly started getting attached/married = they would only go if their partner's with them. OR, the things we all would enjoy doing are different e.g, diff music tastes, the ""kdrama"" friends, the ""angmor show"" friends, the ""cafe"" friends, the ""bar/club"" friends, etc. They're ALL different. It just so happens the things that I wanna do/talk about are always with different friends so I've never consistently hung out with the same group. This also means different people know different sides of me. NO ONE knows me very well tbh...
I'm starting to get real damn lonely knowing I'm not close enough to anyone to tell/rant shit to because we're just ""hang out once in awhile"" friends see... And it gets depressing that I'll have smth I'm really excited about but I don't know who I can discuss the meme/joke/topic with bc everyone has diff interests/busy with their work/busy with their partners etc. Btw don't get me wrong, I have a partner too but I'd really like to maintain my friendships...After all, partners can also have different hobbies even if we're bfgf whatnot. And I would hate it if my partner was my only/entire social life. That's really pathetic. Plus when I hang with my still-single friends, I refuse to bring my partner bc I don't want them to feel like a light-bulb haha (yes i'm considerate to all you single peeps lol).
Oh and maybe one of the worst feelings is when I'm having relationship issues but I don't have anyone I trust/close enough to really listen to me for the right reasons (meaning they're not just ""kpo"" and getting the ""tea"" for free lol). Because let's be honest lol, some people are ""excited"" to hear when they see relationships cracking yknow. I refuse to let my issues (that are close to my heart) be their fun topic to discuss with their partners at home lolol. And I know everyone's busy, I don't want to dump stuff on people and expect them to rant with me (it's emotionally AND mentally taxing to be an active listener too, I know.)
Ugh I just feel so fkin alone in life most of the time... It just keeps getting worse and worse as I get older. I'm not too sure if anyone else can relate or I'm really just pathetic and not as likeable as those people in consistent ""big"" cliques haha. And sorry if it's hard to read bc I just typed this out on the fly hahaha wanted to get this off my chest

61046,108078,"I think it is extremely weird how people tend to actively campaign that pursuing marriage and family is a good thing even when the divorce rates are rising, and of those who do stay married, a significant proportion regret their decisions.
Speaking as child of divorce, I look back at my childhood as a period filled with shouting, cold wars, angry driving, and passive aggression. Both my parents are doctors. While I’ve never had much by way of financial troubles, it was very rarely peaceful.
You wouldn’t recommend a restaurant with 2.5/5 to a friend or a family member, why is there such a low threshold when it comes to suggesting that marriage ought to be in the lives of everyone? All I hear is personal anecdotes of how family is the happiest thing to happen to who and who but I have heard more anecdotes of how family ruined people’s lives. And I know what the comments are gonna be—more anecdotal arguments.
I take your point. Family CAN be extremely rewarding and meaningful. But opportunity costs exists that people do not like to talk about. There is a substantial chance that a guy will end up having to deal with a girl who wants everything to be paid for, spends a pile of money on useless luxuries, and refuses to find money on her own, for the rest of his life. There is also a substantial chance that a girl will end up with a guy who doesn’t contribute to household chores, doesn’t participate in childcare, is an abuser, alcoholic, smoker, gambler, delinquent or consorts with prostitutes. Vice versa.
I have a great job (5-figure monthly), a side hustle that is quickly beginning to overtake my job income, and a quiet life. There are no family gatherings I have to attend, no festivals I am forced to celebrate, I am allowed to work as much as I want, which is as much as I can. I enjoy my work. I am also at the age where most of my friends already have kids. I have dated 3 times, and I was close to being married twice. I did not enjoy any of them. All of my former girlfriends understood that I was under a lot of stress having to spend time not working and I had three amicable breakups and I am still on texting terms with all three. I don’t believe in horoscopes but I’ve been called an extreme Capricorn. 
The thing is, family life isn’t for everyone. People need to reconcile this idea with the fact that there is just so much to do nowadays that people can find stimulation and purpose in a variety of things. When you’re born in a paddy field and you expect to die in a paddy field, there’s no a lot of explore. But here I am a quantitative researcher by day, a startup developer by night and a Grab driver on the weekends, I don’t have much time for anything. People say I’m bored but I’m not. I actually wish I had more time. People also wonder what’s the point in making so much money and my answer has always been, it’s not about the money I just can’t be still.
So please, general public, understand that the world is simultaneously a lot larger and a lot smaller nowadays. Even though I’m not contributing to national interests, I do believe I’m pulling my weight in other ways. Don’t feel sad for me. I’m doing fine.

However, after spending a couple of decades in the workforce, I've realized that good things come to those who take them, rather than those who wait. If you want it, ask for it, and take it. Most importantly, saying no to most people and standing firm in those decisions is paramount. I've spent my fair share of overnight hours and weekends laboring to build someone else’s castle. I was known for my hardworking and accountable attitude. All my colleagues knew that I wouldn’t give up until the last minute. If someone quit and no one else could pick up their work? People knew I would take it on, ensuring no delays. But I suppose, I won’t be taken advantage of anymore. It’s time to build my own castle instead of others'. If your castle falls because of your poor planning, I ain't going down with you, for I know I can always build my own castle, anywhere, anytime.
And for those just starting out in the workforce, know that your relationship with your job is purely transactional/ give & take. There’s no such thing as you’re blessed by the employer with the job. They need something from you i.e your skills/capabilities thus they give you the role.

61014,108018,"I go lunch with my colleagues. 
Initially, all of them were speaking English. However, after a while, they start talking in their own language. The worst part was that I was the odd one out. 
Well, to be fair, I learned the language when I was really young so I can catch the drift. I am a junior so I dont dare to say anything. They do know that I can understand bits here and there but they still continue. Sometimes, I totally get lost and lose interest to the point, I just scroll my phone.
I know all the 4 main languages in bits and pieces - none of them fully mastered except maybe English. I am better at some while I am really bad at others.
I do speak to some colleagues in my or their mother tongue. However, due to my experience, if there are people who dont understand the language, I would switch to English immediately.
So I had a new colleague come in and he was struggling. I spoke to him in his mother tongue and to be clear, I was dicussing with him 1 on 1. However, my colleague came out of nowhere and hinted to use English. So I thought he realised how I must have felt because at least, I can understand a bit whereas he didn't understand anything in my convo.
However, at the next lunch, he continued to do speak in their mother tongue.
I have experienced or seen other people experiencing similar things since young with every single group except English. It is kind of annoying. When I am part of the majority, I would ask everyone to speak in English. I feel powerless to do the same when I am a minority in the group.
I decided to take up classes to futher my learning in that language that I was weak in. 
However, inside me, I dont feel comfortable trying to learn now. On one hand, yes, it is a skill and will let me converse with my friends better or better understand them or they might feel at ease conversing theirbmother tongue.
However, on the other hand, I feel like that it is just an excuse for them to continue this. I dont see them trying to learn about my culture or language the way I do. If I dont learn, I cannot understand what they are talking and it can affect my work as there are discussions which affects. If they dont learn any of the other languages, no loss to them. 
I dont know if I am doing the right thing.
Not everyone is bad. There are people who are considerate in all groups but there are just very few of them unfortunately.

61024,108037,"Hi, I been feeling quite drained at work since months ago and have almost reached to one year of working at my current workplace. The thought of resigning has been occuring in my mind.
It does affects my mental health in some ways as I am not doing the work that I enjoy, don't really enjoy the whole company culture/environment and not being treated respectable by clients/colleagues as they deemed that I am not meeting their expectation consistently which I do felt uncomfortable of the vibes from them. I do not have much support from my team as well as this is mainly a solo position posted to the client site. 
However the thing is, I would have a bonus (~10k+) at the year end but I would require to stay on for few months, which adds up to around 6 more months to endure (*counting from current month). 
Would you suggest if I should find another job (for the sake of not wasting more time on not doing something not considered as growth in career learning/enjoy in it & mental happiness state) or should I ""force"" myself to endure 6 more months just to entitle for the bonus payout..?
Thank you all.

61025,108041,"I visited NUS uTown for lunch. These bunch of foreginers have total disregard for hygeine, you can guess where. Talking loudly at 'this restaurant' in uTown. Seeing them already irks me. Its lunch time, let the students find a place for meals before lesson. Not come here as tourist and chope the table. Didnt even clear the trays as well. Told them off, and they have the check to ask me to do it since i wanted the seat. Fine, whatever.  Worst is others from the same tour group took the whole bunch of chopsticks and spoons and distributed around. Imagine the number of hands passing around and holding where you mouth and or food is going to be in contact with. Least they could do was to carry the basket holding the utensils and distribute. But no, their unswine culture demands them to hold and touch every single piece of utensils. And putting the extra back to the common pile. I told the staff, which obviously is from the nationality, sided with them and refused to change or wash the utensils. With my food alrdy on my table and me waiting stupidly for the musical chairs of utensils to return back to the ""utensils here"" area i picked out the cleanest looking pair of chopsticks and spoon and ate my meal.
Lo and behold, 2.5hours later the GP diagnosis me with probable unclean food digestion. Wasted no thought, ask for fecal matter lab test, and report the restaurant to NEA. Good luck to those uncultured humans who cant seem to even integrate with society. Yet they are everywhere .

61042,108072,"Hi, just want to seek advice:
My supervisor forces students to work for very long hours and even on weekends/public holidays. Sure he would not leave any evidence like ""you must come on PH/weekends"" in order to prevent student reporting to department, but he always says abusive words like ""your work is useless and you are not in a proper state/manner of research"" without giving any academic advice. He sends messeges at even 3AM as well. In order to MAKE us ""voluntarily"" work for long hours, he has a series of PUA discourse: 1) you dont have a proper attitude of research 2) I dont know how can you push this kinda useless data in your work 3) I want to help you graduate so must do the work I assign to you 4) I'm treating you with the lowest requirement, but if you still cannot get a positive result then I have no way but let you master out.  etc etc. He communicate with us in mandarin for most time. He never holds a group meeting. I cannot learn anything from him. What I learn by myself is useless to him. He somtimes sleeps in his office during office time.
Dont say this is NORMAL for a graduate study, and I have spend almost 3 years in this group. There is no way to change to another group or master out, because I performed quite well in QE. I know I am not the most hard-working student/smart guy, but I really feel low-self esteem after changing 6 projects and being scolded ""useless"", ""bad data"", ""having no proper attitude"" for these years, even though I have several sets of good data.
I am considering reporting this supervisor after graduation, especially to focus on his destroy of student's mental health and self-esteem. 
So sorry that I feel very overwhelmed and annoyed. I should've focus on my project and graduation requirements, but I just feel so destroyed.

Im 25, working at my current workplace for 2 years. I managed to persuade my managers from 3.5 to above 6k in 2 years. Or maybe Im just lucky, teammate on leave, reservice, etc. So I was assigned to replace them for that period of time, and maybe I proved to my managers I can do it, hence the increment?
Anyways, I know above 6 is honestly very high, considering I'm only a diploma holder too. But I'm getting really tired, I don't look forward to work here anymore. I'm sick of my managers and supervisors. 
My issue is I want to quit but I am scared I cannot find companies that is willing to pay so much for someone with only 2 years experience. Also, my current scope is totally not what I've studied, and I honestly and no interest since the start. Can I find a job of my preferred role, and still have same range salary?

61044,108075,"To the OP of #108064, I am in a similar situation as you, except I am the wife of the cheating husband. I came across some msgs from him to a female colleague along the line of “missing you” and “you are pretty” and showered her with some gifts. Basically it is as if he was wooing her. He said they are just good friends and he has not cheated or done anything wrong to the marriage. Who is he kidding? At least you have acknowledged you are cheating emotionally.
You mentioned things were mundane but let’s say if your wife was feeling the same, is it right if she gets close to a handsome colleague, will that be ok to you? There are so many stunners (in your words) out there, are you going to chase after all of them? Think of why you chase after your wife in the first place, why did you marry her? If she has neglected you now, ask yourself why? Is she busy with work? Household chores? Handling the kids? Is what you are doing being fair to her? It takes two to clap. In the first place why are you even comparing who is prettier? Your colleague might be the prettier one, your friends probably said your wife is, because they do not want to encourage you to go that way.
It sucks to be the victim of the cheating spouse. Bad thoughts consume me everyday. Though I chose to take it as it is, there is always wandering thoughts of my husband still cheating on me. I am tormented and everyday is a torture to me. I do not wish your wife to experience the same as me.
So please, stay away from your colleague. Do not do something which your parents or wife, and even children will not be proud of. Don’t wait till it is too late. Like all guys who cheat put it, it is just a “fleeting moment” or “moment of folly” so let it pass. Do not mistaken peace as boredom.

61010,108007,"This is my take on the Hybrid Work. I am also an NUS staff. My unit has prepared for all of us to hotdesk. Asked us to vacate our desks months ago and alot of works were going in to change our office and the way we work. Honestly, we were all so much looking forward to it because we thought finally we are shifting away from the typical office layout and going to have a new and fun way of working. The new office was planned to look modern and colourful just like Google office etc. Now with NUS Circular and directions to return to on-site 4days, all the plans have to be discarded. They are now trying to find everyone a designated seat again just because they have no other choice and have to abide by the rule. It is really very frustrating given that this was being planned for so long and it just has to be thrown out because of a single directive. Many of my colleagues made long term arrangements in-line with the hotdesking policy. Now, they are all anxious. I dont understand why we have to do things just because we have to do things. Why can we embrace new things if they are better? We are already one of the most stressed cities in the world, most expensive and also very congested. Such hybrid work and hotdesking just allows companies and Singapore as a whole to operate more efficiently. Less crowd at canteens, save monthly travel expenses and food expenses and at the end of the day, work is done. People feel less stressed, more happy. Even for those who do to office daily, less crowd, less jam? We still come in to office weekly. We still have productive and interactive meetings. But newer ways of working were just something we looked forward to. Admin please kindly please assist to post this. I hope the senior management considers our pleas.

61057,108098,"I think I started liking my close friend. I nvr think of her in that way. We’re just friends and getting along w each other. Everyone admires her. She is like a standard student, kind and caring. 
Unlike my friendship w other female friends, it was quite diff w her. I feel safe when I’m w her and I can just act like a child ard her. She makes a lot of small jokes n likes to tease me a lot (which i’ve experienced guys acting like this ard me) which a girl normally doesn’t do to another girl. For me, it was just a pure platonic friendship for a whole year until I went for my vacation. I somehow keep thinking abt her n kinda miss her when she is not Ard me. I won’t declare that I’m straight but just out of nowhere I started thinking her differently, getting nervous ard her n keep finding her for no reason just to spend time. Initially I just thought i m not serious cos she is just my best friend and may b I’m just having a mood-swing or smth. But My addiction to her is rlly quite bad. Idk how I start having feeling or why I like her so much but I’ve fallen hard until I can’t focus on my daily work. 
I obviously don’t have courage to tell her that I have feelings for her. But I somehow confessed her in a joking way that I want to be her wife and i will only marry to her. Starting from then, we started addressing each other as wives n I started acting like one. She is probably just playing along w me , thinking that it’s the straight girl jokes. But I’m not !!!!  Everyone ard us also just thinks that we’re just too close and both of us look like straight too.
 
Things are very messed up hahaha. Im scared I will ruin our bond if I confess. Anyway, I dun hv courage to tell her directly that I like her but I want to make her realised that I have feelings for her, not as a friend. How!!

61064,108115,"During my internship earlier this year in June, I was fortunate to work under a talented, ambitious and attractive supervisor in what I had previously assumed to be a boring run-of-the-mill job. Near the end of the internship, her team, including myself, was invited to her 30th birthday party at an upscale restaurant. 
It was there that I had met her husband for the first time, and I'm disappointed with him. I don't think he takes care of himself: he dressed sloppily in a slightly oversized polo, unkempt hair, not engaging in any conversation, and downright not worthy of her. I became secretly rather angry and disheartened that someone like her would be off the market for someone like him. 
Now I'm back in class, unable to study or focus on much, thinking about her deeply for the past weeks. I've been resisting the urge to text or even follow her on social media, but it's demanding so much of my patience. Fate is cruel. Even though she is eight years older than me, I've never had a crush on someone so deeply before.

61060,108104,"I'm in my late 20s, finally walked out from a pretty depressing situation. To summarise, I was left hanging by this guy whom I've met through tinder - 6 months, and reconnected a few years after. We separated as he was only early months into army, he didn't want commitment or let anyone else knew he was attached. Thereafter, we reconnected again and we both said nothing, it was silent but acted as though we were a couple. He puts his career first and likewise, didn't want to commit but enjoying all the benefits, thoughtfulness and sweetness I would bring to him. 
Just like this, I fell into depression after ending a relationship which never started - silenced for one year falling deeper and deeper for him. He knew I had feelings for him but watched me falling in love with him, without telling me to stop. However, as years past it just takes that one brave moment to turn away from him when all red flags were clear and seen. 
It saddens me how the bad people live a good life (he is in the sales industry and earns nearly half a million income) while i'm everyday working 9-5 just to lead a stable life. Life is so unfair, just because he's rich he gets away from the wrongdoings and living a good life than many others who are more deserving and down to earth.

I mean, if it's a huge public issue that everyone needs to be aware of, then that is very understandable. But, if it's like a personal problem with someone, what's the point of spilling everything in social media? And the people reading it will immediately just side on the complaining party just cause they're ""bestfriend"" etc. It makes no sense. 
When I have issues with someone, I talk to that someone. Find the issue, talk about the issue, come up with a good solution for the issues, find common ground, etc. And still the issues will be between us and not the public.
Do people who spill everything online just want attention? Or perhaps they want the validation up justify that their feelings are ""valid""? Or perhaps they are in the wrong, but they want people to have pity on them still? 
Is that why? I don't know. I'm trying to understand this really. So please give me some thoughts.

61065,108116,"Been on 3 dates with this man and there's something very charismatic about him that I can't describe. He reminded me of the pure, sweet first love I had experienced and ended a couple of years ago with my first love amicably. Since then, I haven't been able to move on as I always knew he was the one for me, and I thought we could build an amazing life together but circumstances chose to tear us apart.
Recently I heard from a mutual friend that he is expecting to be a father soon. It's a bittersweet feeling as that could potentially be ""us,"" but I guess life has its way of teasing you, which is inevitable to bring you to the ultimate one. Despite that, I am happy for him from the bottom of my heart. Being single all these years has made me prioritise and be selective with how I spend my time and who I spend it with, as I enjoy alone time and away from the dramas and negativity. 
Going back to him, I felt like he let me see a glimpse of light to the end of the tunnel. You know how when you meet someone for the first time and go, ""oh this person does have a purpose in life and doesn't waste time on things he don't enjoy or sees value in?"" I guess that summarises my encounter with him. I also learned that he's sporty and humorous, yet chill (lives in the moment vibe). He might be the missing piece I need in my life. Perhaps it could help that our family is acquainted, which makes me feel that extra connection in this relationship.
I am already looking forward to the next date, and also, shoutout to the singles out there: don't give up. I am sure someday you will meet someone who makes you feel that special connection tho atm I am not sure where this is heading, but I am getting a good feeling out of this.

61066,108117,"Tell me if what I did is wrong. 
Basically I did a simple experiment to determine if people are attention seeking with their ""mental illness"". 
So a friend of mine has 3 younger siblings, aged 18, 16, and 14. None of them got much exposure from the internet. Strictly only use it for studying. They have social medias but not using it often. All of them are normal and have pretty much a simple life. Sometimes my friend asked me to look after them when he's out, and since I knew them , I just say why not. Sometimes not all 3 are at the house at the same time. So while its just me with one of them, I started my experiment.
So here's what I did : For the 18 year old, I talked to him about a mental disorder called Dissociative identity disorder (DID). It's just a talk, and I told him lots of facts about it and how scary it is if that happens to anyone. I even told him one example from media would be Moon Knight from Marvel. And I showed him various videos of explanation about it.
For the 16 year old, I told her about Tourette Syndrome (TS). I explained to her all the info about it, and showed videos of people with actual TS to her just for her to understand it better. I told her that they couldn't control it, and some people don't tend to understand them, which makes them frustrated. 
For the 14 year old, I told him about Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explained to him how its common for soldiers to have them after the war, and that they have vivid flashback of horrible, shocking, scary events. I showed some videos to make him understand, and explained to him how its tough for them to go through that.
After that, about 2 week later, I visited my friend's place to hangout, and my friend is visibly upset. I asked what happened and he said that his younger siblings is going through some ""phase"". So I checked and talk to them. 
The 18 year old make these dumb overexaggerated movement and facial expression, and became ""someone else"" entirely, and he told everyone he has DID. Note that he has been normal all these time. The 16 year old kept on having tics that sounded really really fake, and told everyone that she has TS. Note that she has been speaking just fine with 0 issues. The 14 year kept on screaming uncontrollably for minutes when he hears a loud sound, claiming that he's ""traumatized"". Note that he often play with loud things like fireworks, drums, etc.
All of them faked their disorders HAHAHAHAHAHA! Now they go around to their friends, and pretended to have these things HAHAHAHAHAHA! AND NOW THEIR FRIENDS SO CALLED HAVE THESE DISORDERS WHEN THEY DON'T HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
Here's the thing, I didn't do anything wrong. All I did was educating them and spread awareness about these disorders. They're the ones attention seeking HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! So I have come to the results that people, especially online, who claimed to have these disorders and tells everyone about it are nothing but attention seeking losers. My experiment proves it!
But what's your thoughts about this? I'm not wrong now right? :D

61071,108128,"So it started with him making statements to insinuate I’m fat & look horrible in makeup. I see those as jokes. 
Then he whacked the head on random days. Whack, not pat. I told him it’s bad behaviour and to stop it. Hitting the head makes peop dumb, not an acceptable behaviour. 
Then we got into arguments. He remained silent and ignored me. That triggered me. I started shoving him. At one point, he got mad and the lethal kicks came. 
2 nights ago, we got into a very very heated argument. Something blew off in him and he slapped me. Not once. Of cos I retaliated and it became a fight. There were slaps and tussling. I fought so hard my ring finger got bruised. Visually blue blacked that night. I slapped him so hard, his spec flew off. 
I told him I gonna divorce him if he hit me again. He continued to hit me. Then he went off. 
When I started eating dinner, I realised my left jaw hurt from eating. The realisation that my husband is getting increasingly violent yet unrepentant hit me hard. That got me upset. I started crying and wailing. Literally. He told me he didn’t give a shit if I might be P+ and threatened to kick my tummy. He asked me to cry louder. This conversation repeated twice.
The next day, he behaved as in nothing happened. And upon my silent treatment and insistent that he apologise for his bad behaviour, he apologised. Then his message came to say he is sorry for hitting me. I felt bad because I hit him very hard too. My ring finger bruised from whacking him. I got minor blue blacks on both hands and a visible blue black on the back of my right arm which hurt.

61053,108093,"Need advice. Sorry, long rant ahead. 
TLDR: Dad may have health conditions, but too stubborn to listen or do anything about it. Help. 
My family think that my father has potential health conditons. He's always coughing (every time for years, even way before covid), slightly HoH, can't walk much (but can always go across the causeway), etc... But he refuses to go for health checkup. Even if he go, he'll complain every moment during waiting period n give u the black face treatment, then say nothing wrong. If they assign him a follow up appointment, he won't go and give a ton of resons. My mum's english isn't very good so the one time she followed him for check up, she can't really understand. She understood the doctor mentioned not to eat too many fruits w high sugar content like xxxxx but did he listen? No. He go masseurs and asked them if he can eat xxxxx, they said can n he eat everyday. He don't take care of his diet. High sugar drinks everyday. When we talk with him regarding his health or diet, he either brush it off n walk off, or just ignore us completely n pretend he can't hear a word when we're sitting right next to him. Recently he went to another check up for his job and he has the letter in his room. He's supposed to go for a follow up check up. We found out about the letter but wondering how to bring it up (since he's obviously hiding it). I pretended to ask if the check up n if they gave anything for follow up. He said no, they don't give anything, they took everything. When i suggest going follow up check up anyway, he just walked off. 
It's best if I can go with him for his check up but its always during my work hours and he never tell ne beforehand. If i just book an appointment for him, he'll give a lot of reasons (usually work, tired, etc) n he won't go. 
Worse is he has no savings. He likes to spend. What if the worst happens?? I can only hope for my savings but even i dont have much. ..

61009,108005,"You guys ever been in a situation where you’re just talking to friends and you add in to the convo, then it becomes awkward because “no one else does that.”
Like I’ve always struggled with social situations. And people always just went “you have to learn how to interact with others.” 
So I did. I read lots of books, what to look out for, read up on psychology, how to phrase responses to people, how to identify what people look out for, how to read body language, how to negotiate.
Honestly it gets exhausting cause it’s like maintaining a file on people. Their likes, dislikes, habits etc.
So I was just talking to my friends when we were discussing about social situations, and I was like “oh yeah I have like a chart in my head. For example, if someone has a baby picture in their wallet, I try to ask about their kid. Even if I’m not interested but it makes me look interested… how much time do you guys set aside at the end of the day to review information like that anyway? I find I need a minimum of three hours.”
There was like a long silence and then one of them went, “Uh… no one does that.”
And I was like “what?”
Turns out for them it’s “intuitive”. No wonder they don’t notice some details about people. 
I pass off as a social creature but only through sheer hard work… after over ten years of it, I can’t say it’s become a habit cause it’s actively applied every day, but it does get easier.
But that was also the day I realised generally people do not have social interaction flow charts in their head when talking to someone. 
Just… so much hard work. I wish I could cut down the time.
But yeah if any of you were told that you need better social skills, good news it can happen. Bad news it’s exhausting and it takes up a lot of time, and like any skill you have to actively practice to hone it. 
There’s some light though at the end of the tunnel. I’ve become so good at it that occasionally (not all the time kay) I do better at social interactions with others than my friends who are more intuitively inclined; and they’ve taken advice when I suggest how to word things for negotiation at work.

61076,108135,"In the beginning, I was a member of this clique, but I eventually distanced myself as I found their behaviors incredibly toxic. I don't intend to come across as rude, but I simply can't comprehend why the rest that is inside the clique would condone and encourage cheating, and go as far as insulting someone's spouse behind their back especially when they have a kid together! It's astonishing how they manage to convince themselves that such actions are not only acceptable but also justified.
Moreover, there's one specific girl in the group who seems to be the mastermind behind this situation. It's puzzling how she manipulates circumstances to victimize herself, claiming her boyfriend doesn't care because of his work-related travels. Meanwhile, she engages in deceitful activities, lying in other men's beds and going on dates with people on Tinder, all while keeping it hidden from her partner of years. (She's the person who encouraged the married individual the most to cheat on their spouse.) 
What strikes me as utterly ridiculous is her self-appointed role as a ""queen bee,"" using her insecurities as a justification to ostracize others and label them as weird. This behavior, rooted in a need for attention and validation, showcases a deep-seated insecurity. At the end of the day, resorting to such childish tactics and trampling on others to feel better about oneself is a clear sign of a profoundly insecure human being.

The problem is bosses at my place seems to be everyday co bo, always ask people to hold this event and that event, and people who also co bo and do these events are those going to get appreciated more. Being a very introvert person, I feel a bit uncomfortable always have to be in such situation. Sometimes, when at such event, must keep avoiding liquor drink  as i totally dun like. I am wondering why can't people just accept differences well, there are people who enjoy the events and cca. But there are also people who can't enjoy it, why don't just let them escape such tortures, and contribute thru other means.  The definition of ""fun"" is different for everybody.  People in this world keep talking about cannot discriminate against skin color, race, etc. But why people can't see that many people are discriminating against personality at work where social butterfly and extroverts are generally perceived as the role model to follow? Anyone feel the same?

61045,108076,"I’m the poster of #108064. The guy with the 13 year relationship wife and 2 kids.
I read the comments and appreciate all those who given me constructive and sincere advice.
It’s really a struggle for me right now.
I guess you guys are right to call me out for being bored and “itchy”. 
It’s also true I harbor the “what if i date another girl” mindset.
I understand the struggles and commitment given by my wife into this relationship but sometimes those effort doesn’t forge love.
It’s not about the physical needs, I have my hands if any. It’s my emotional needs that are not met.
Everyday, I come home to my family and spend the next 1-2 hours revising homework/ read storybook with my elder kid while my wife attends to the younger one. When they both sleep, it’s 10pm.
My wife would have to work until 11pm to clear her emails while I do the dishes and pack the school bag.
This routine has gone on for the past year.
After my wife is done with her work, she would wash up and sleep thereafter.
We barely spend 15 mins talking. Even if we do, it’s about the kids.
I’m starting to think my wife and my love language have changed over time.
Our love languages used to be physical touch. but now I crave for words of affirmation.  
I know my wife is displaying the love language of acts of service but that isn’t speaking to me. 
My wife is too focused on her work and our family. I am grateful for her effort she puts into this family. 
As a man, I feel hard to broach the topic that I feel neglected and somewhat lonely at home. 
I know I’ve mentioned I talk to my colleague a lot but our talks are not sexual but really just simple celebrity gossips, trending news and so forth which is typically what 2 good friends would chat about. And yes I admit I really do enjoy talking to her about this during daily lunches. I dare go a step further to say that these chats help to fulfill a void in my emotional space. 
???? for those who are trolling me or just barraging me with negative comments, you just don’t understand my position.
Ive never thought of cheating physically.

61033,108060,"Status-less Long Distance Relationship (25F) (28M) 
Hey everyone, 
I've got a bit of a relationship puzzle on my hands and I'd love to hear your thoughts and advice. Here's the scoop:
My partner (28M) and I (25F) met in Singapore and we had an amazing 3-month connection. But, here's the twist - he had to head back to his home country, and while he's eager to return to Singapore (possibly around January 2024), it's not set in stone. The final decision lies with his company, so it's a bit of a waiting game.
Now, here's where things get interesting. We haven't officially put a label on our relationship, knowing he'd be leaving soon. But there's definitely a strong liking and care between us. I mustered up the courage to ask him about 'what are we?' and the whole exclusivity thing right before he left. His response was a bit ambiguous. He didn't want to make any promises at the moment, but he also mentioned he'd be up for exclusivity without the official status. So, it's left me in a bit of a relationship limbo.
Honestly, part of me really wants to wait for him. I'm not keen on dating multiple people simultaneously, and I believe in taking chances on love. But I can't deny that I have my moments of doubt. Especially with 6 hours time difference, there is less communication, and without a defined status or a set date for our next meeting, I'm left pondering whether this is worth pursuing.
What do you think, fellow redditors? Have you been in a similar situation? Any advice or personal stories to share? I'm all ears and looking forward to your insights! ????❤️????️

61041,108069,"Unpopular opinion: I really do think there should be a basic English requirement test for all foreigners wanting to become citizens. 
Sg is really forgiving and understanding when it comes to foreign talents. It's becoming a bit unfair to us locals. At work, we need to switch from channel 5 to channel 8 quick when a prc colleague switches channel as and when he or she cannot converse in English. Many times our Indian boss just look at us and we have to become instant MFA translators to fill the gaps. 
In queues for food and other stuff, we also sometimes have to become instant translators for ppl who cannot converse in english to the service crew over the counter. A few times the macik at old Chang kee just looked at me to ask for help when a prc wants a curry puff or a stick of fishballs but cannot say it properly. 
While I love being bilingual or semi trilingual, it really helps that they know what they are getting themselves into when they migrate to sg. Sg may be predominantly chinese populated, but somehow I got the vibes that they are exploiting this to get into the country. 
Some social science ppl will say, what about the older generation that cannot English? In the first place, why are we even comparing our grandparents or senior citizens who have already been in the country for so long, to those that have just entered or are planning to enter sg to live long term? Why are we pinning them against outsiders that want to become part of our society/community? To put it bluntly, there's no need to use our oldies (who have long earned their places locally) to compare with the newbies. Earn and work it.
Then some will say English tests are repetitive and can be exploited.  Then switch it up? Just like psle. And I'm not even saying the English needs to be British level, cos we all know sg English ain't that level too. All I'm saying is, basic English standards so that there is minimal language barriers with others. And I hear my social science ppl say again, why can't we accommodate to them instead? Then my rebuttal will be, why can't they accommodate to us? 入乡随俗. Heck I'm using their own indiom to explain the concept. Then what about our service ppl and neighbours who aren't chinese and need not learn chinese? Is it fair to them?
Whatever, I can't say for everyone but for me, I'm starting to feel more like a foreigner in my own country.

61043,108073,"I'm in my late 20s, finally walked out from a pretty depressing situation. To summarise, I was left hanging by this guy whom I've met through a dating app - 6 months, and reconnected a few years after. We separated as he was only early months into army, he didn't want commitment or let anyone else knew he was attached. Thereafter, we reconnected again and we both said nothing, it was silent but acted as though we were a couple. He puts his career first and likewise, didn't want to commit but enjoying all the benefits, thoughtfulness and sweetness I would bring to him. 
Just like this, I fell into depression after ending a relationship which never started - silenced for one year falling deeper and deeper for him. He knew I had feelings for him but watched me falling in love with him, without telling me to stop. However, as years past it just takes that one brave moment to turn away from him when all red flags were clear and seen. 
It saddens me how the bad people live a good life (he is in the sales industry and earns nearly half a million income before 30) while i'm everyday working 9-5 job just to lead a stable life. Life is so unfair, just because he's rich he gets away from the wrongdoings and living a good life than many others who are more deserving and down to earth. 
Why is it the nice always suffers, the bad always wins?

The same advice applies for a guy who feels that family is taking up too much of their effort, time and money.
This is not to say people shouldn’t pursue a family. You cannot logically have both (be at the top of your profession and have a functioning family) without your partner having to sacrifice. Being at the top of anything requires commitment. Not just 80% commitment, you need to want it more than anything else. Wanting something more than anything else entails sacrifice. If you’re not willing to make the sacrifice, don’t complain that you’re not getting the results you wish for because you get back what you put in.

I personally lead a fulfilling life while having a healthy routine coming to office 5 days a week so I don't see how this is a problem. Moreover, I always come in early after dropping my son off at school and I stay the full day except when there are things I need to do. Everyday, I like greeting the staff and also seeing them around the office. It's depressing to see empty workstations all the time, it's like seeing fish tanks without any fish or bird cages without any birds. Generations of employees have been going to a workplace to work 5 or even 6 days a week, isn't that just the expectation unless you are purely a subcontractor doing some computer work? Working remotely should only be the expectations for some jobs or temp work and not for all office positions. People are so lazy it's disgusting, so many people don't deserve their pay. Given how much time people spend on their phones and in toilets while they are supposed to be at work, they ought to be working 6 days a week to be fair to those of us who come in to office regularly 5 full days. They are not married and don't spend time with their family on the weekends, they will otherwise probably just be playing on their phones all day on Saturdays anyway.
Complaining about working in the office should be regarded as work avoidance and disciplinary examples ought to be made to end this nonsense.
