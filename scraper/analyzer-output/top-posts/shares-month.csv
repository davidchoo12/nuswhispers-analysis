60036,105979,"My boyfriend in Meta got layoff.
I was promised a great future with him when he secured a job at Meta at SV. We were in talks about whether I shld join him in California and live the American dream. However all this came to a halt when he phoned me last night sayin that he's one of the 11% that got laid off. A part of me died. He told me that he'll look for another job in the states so that we can resume our plan. Given the current economy, I doubt that is possible and I suggested him to return to SG which he outright refuse. He claimed that SG is not as prestigious as SV in terms of tech which I beg to differ as beggars can't be chooser. I'm at my wits end now and I'm unsure of what to do. He's childish and immature. The only things he loves to talk about is tech stuff which I find unromantic and boring. He stan Muck Zuckerberg & the meta-verse so much that I find him delusional. I am contemplating on moving on from this relationship and finding someone who's more realistic.
Call me a good digger if you want but I can no longer see how the relationship can survive just like how I'm misled by him into thinking that terra luna would survive.

60001,105910,"This is bothering me for a while. A while ago I was doing internship in a bank, there I met a NUS senior of my age. She's 23 just like me, I kinda have a crush on her. The thing is she has a bf who works in the same bank and she is getting married this year. The BF is 36 years old and is a senior banker. They both been dating for 2 years, when she did the same internship.
I found out later that this phenomenon is common in the bank, with many dudes around 10-15 years older than their spouse. Another intern(21) also dated one dude 9 years older because he has a car, condo and a 100k salary package.
At this rate all the good ones are getting hunted by all these rich old man. To the girls, Isn't it really disgusting to date someone almost 1.5 times older than you?
Recently I shared this thought with a friend, and she told me that if she was could find a 100k per annum dude with a car and condo, she'd marry him no matter how bad he is. Worst come to worst she could just divorce and ask for alimony.
What is this world coming to? Maybe I should go for dudes instead.

One example is selecting me. If you realise that I am an important candidate. You have to make your decision to hire urgently before other company will snatch me away.
Those important but not urgent task can leave to the intern or other colleagues.
One example is other candidate. They are also urgent because other company will also snatch them away. However, they are not important because I hope that you have made the correct decision to hire me.
You just need to find another colleague to go through the interview process with them.

60007,105924,"I have been in a situationship for almost 2 years now. For those that don’t know, a situationship is basically doing all the relationship stuff but not “dating” or officially “in a relationship” so it’s not here not there la. I asked him about it but he said it’s not the right time to get into a relationship because he is not at a good place and will not be able to commit to me at a relationship level.
Then my question is, he keeps saying he cares about me a lot or appreciate me a lot, how he’s able to be himself with me. But if 2 years with me and he’s still not sure… Am i not just a back-up plan or stand-in until someone he is ready to commit comes by…
I don’t know la. I think I know I should go but it’s so hard cause he makes me happy but… do i make him happy? I think his friends makes him happier Lor… This situationship is bothering me I don’t want to waste more time committing to a maybe.. but what if i leave and I lose something that could have been long lasting into a relationship..

60056,106012,"A random girl added me on insta recently & started sliding into my DMs. I chatted with her & she asked for my number to move the convo to WA. On WA, we chatted for a few day. She was quite flirtatious & always initiated the convo. So I thought she was interested in me.
But one day, she asked me to help her with her part-time lobang which is basically an e-commerce scam which I was familiar with (as I fell for this exact scam b4 by a different person). So I said no, then she became verbally abusive, forceful & demanding, trying to pressure me to do this so called lobang. For days I held my ground & said no, but continued to casually talk to her as I was bored anyways & needed something entertaining to see me through my busy work week (my job is pretty stressful IDK why). From this moment on, I mostly initiated the convo for fun. For days she also tried to convince me to do this “lobang” but to no avail. Eventually, she got very tired & did not want to talk to me anymore. So before I ended the comms, I asked her why she was doing this scam & she told me something that got me pondering.
She said she wanted a better life. Then I tried to be more sympathetic & said that Singapore is a hard place to live because it is very expensive. She kind of agreed by saying that she does this because she needed to survive & cope with life’s pressure. Since I remember that the year end festive season is coming, so I offered to give her an Ang Bao as an early present. But she refused & wanted me to do the scam instead bcos she preferred “career progression”. I was shocked bcos this so called career of hers is illegal to begin with. So I tried to probe further but to no avail. Perhaps she realised that it was a waste of time talking to me, so we agreed to eventually stopped the convo.
So my question is this, what should I do?Should I have reported her or helped her? And if I were to help her, how should I do it ? Also, are there online scammers out there facing the same struggles as her? Given that the economy is gloomy & uncertain & inflation is a huge burden for many …

60079,106053,"I have been with my boyfriend for like 2 and half years and recently he has been going to play poker like almost every weekend. Sometimes even on the weekdays. We have argued until a point where I’m getting tired. If i dont allow him to go, he would get mad. So usually to avoid argument, i just let him go. Idk its normal that your partner can just go gamble and leave you alone on the weekend.
One time he was feeling upset and actually told me he wanted to go play poker. But I’m like if you’re upset, you can talk to me and we can spend time together. If you’re upset, but you’re thinking of gambling rather than coming to me, am I even important?
Idk what to do as I’m too comfortable with him. I stay at his place most of the time. He would sometimes ask me to go together, but i really dislike people who gamble. So I don’t usually follow. The worst part is, he kinda got to know those other poker players through me. Kinda regret intro-ing them in the first place.
I feel like he's getting addicted but whenever I mention this, he would deny it and gaslight me. He doesn't like the word ‘addicted’. Last time he would gamble only during cny, but now, saying ""Oh festive season. Once in a while."" Now - idk what to say.
I feel so tired arguing over this. I mentioned to him I wanted to break this off but he would question me about breaking off over such a ""small matter"". He actually treats me quite nice and always pays attention to me. He surprises me sometimes with gifts and dotes on me a lot. I just dislike this particular part of him. Idk what to do. Is this a small matter? Or every couple experiences the same thing?

59990,105888,"I noticed that so many people don’t study, but do better than the honest ones who study. So many people use emotions instead of logic, but somehow score very well academically. So many people are far from the logic-loving robots without feelings, but end up doing so much better than those who use logic to replace feelings and study all the time. I always ask myself, how did they get there?
That one genius in my class who gets 100 or 99 for every single maths test never studies at all. When we are studying, she is watching movies on YouTube before exams. She’s the only one who cried when the teacher showed us a 911 documentary featuring orphans. She has feelings and empathy. She has EQ. And she still has the highest grades ever.
The other friend from secondary school until JC is ALWAYS shopping for makeup, clothes and accessories after school. She spends her weekends cafe hopping with her boyfriend. She said out loud once, “it’s really not the more you study the better you do you know. You can study hard but still don’t do well.” She got 8 distinctions (yes she took h3) for a levels, and 93/100 for her maths promos when 75% of the cohort failed. And yes, she spends 300 dollars a day just shopping at orchard, while I was using logic to replace emotions, and telling myself to be thrifty because it’s a “virtue”. She doesn’t. It’s feelings that drive her to spend on things she doesn’t need. Yet who scores higher? Her.
My 2 acquaintances from JC are a textbook example of MIRACLE. They spend their Jc Life dating, instead of focusing on studies. It’s again, emotions over logic. Them two can never save a single cent of allowance because as soon as they receive it, they spend it all on manicures and shopping sprees. Their wardrobes are jam packed with unnecessary stuff bought on IMPULSE, NOT LOGIC. and guess what? Both got straight A for A levels, and FIRST CLASS HONOURS in university. And they are in the science stream, which emphasises on critical and logical thinking. If they score well for literature or art I’m not surprised because it’s about people and feelings. But……How do they follow their heart and not their head, but do so much better in SCIENCE than us who study all the time?
And my best friends cousin defied everything we learn since young about a “good model student”. She clubs, drinks and vapes every week. She has about 4 tattoos and multiple piercings. She never, ever, uses logic to replace emotions to force herself to study. She follows her heart. She has EQ, the stuff that makes you love and connect with people. She had 4 boyfriends and 3 friends with benefits. And she got into deans list 5 times already, first class honours as well.
I’m quite sure there are a lot of people who just spend their time not studying. When we are studying, they are watching movies. When we are revising, they are shopping. When we logically listen to what primary school Teachers say about “hardwork” and “ thrift “, they are spending all their money without logic, easily filling their hands with shopping bag after shopping bag. When we are staying at home alone to study using IQ, they are connecting with boyfriends , dating, having sex, and exercising EQ.
How then do all these people get straight A including general paper(not Many can get A for that) , and A for science based subjects. Where did the first class honours come out from then?
I realised sadly that academic results are INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL to how much you honestly work hard.

60073,106041,"I’m a 2nd gen Singaporean but both my parents are Filipino. There’s this pinoy from my lecture. Looks 7.5/10 a bit on the short side but average height for pinoy, character idk but he’s quite strange for Singapore standards..? Back home it’s normal but we have cultural differences. The first time we met was during lecture. He sat beside me and greeted me hi in Tagalog and I was quite shocked because I don’t look pinoy but we became friends immediately
He always wears singlet, shorts and slippers to school which to me is ok because it’s comfortable especially in hot weather. We studied together for a few weeks and also go out shopping then I realised that he wears singlet and slippers everywhere. Like really everywhere. Even when we go to nicer place he will wear slippers. Also I noticed that she shaves his legs and armpit and when I ask him he said it’s cooling. One time he ask me go out and eat and he book a nice restaurant and I told him that there’s dress code. Smart casual I think. So means jeans and covered shoes. He showed up in singlet, jacket, shorts and slippers. The waitress at first don’t let us inside but he told her that it’s our anniversary so she let us in after talking to her manager.
I joked to him about it because it was a bit awkward but he laughed it off and said “maybe we should kiss when the waitress comes so she’ll think we’re together”. I am a bit uncomfortable with it but he’s always joking all the time so I don’t know if he’s serious.
Afterwards we went to MBS and walked along the river. At first I thought he see me as friend but he started talking about love and how he wants security so I interrupted him and told him that I’m in a relationship and my gf will not be happy if she finds out. He ask me where my gf and I said in the Philippines and he said “ok what, not like she’ll know” and I said to him “bro I’m not gay” and he said “we can try new things together” I was a bit scared because he’s quite big so I just told him again that I’m not a gay and he said ok. Afterwards I went home and he sent me a super long message about how he thinks I’m cute and he felt that I lie to him by leading him on and being nice to him. He also said that if I wanted to try new things with him just let him know and he’s always waiting for me. I don’t know how to respond because I’m definitely not cute I have a beard and I’m 2 heads taller than him so I just ghost him.
I haven’t replied to him in 1-2 weeks and sometimes I still see him in school but I pretend I didn’t see him and walk away idk how to react any advise? It’s my fault because I didn’t know he was gay at first and thought he was lonely and water friends but I never flirt with him or anything and I always talk to him about the girls I EC.

60080,106054,"I am in my early 30s. Went for a career switch programme 5 years ago. Graduated 2 years later. Got married, got a house, gave birth to a lovable daughter. Wanted to further my studies for a degree a year after diploma but I got pregnant instead. So waited until she’s 2(now), so basically my cert is 3 years old already.
I told my husband I wanted to study again. He was hesitant at first but he agreed. I told him I was accepted in NUS and my classes are in the evening, studying part time while working full time. After a month of school, he expressed that he cannot handle the stress of being with our daughter alone. He needs me around and he’d rather I stopped schooling until she’s older. I have 3 years of school. Only went through 1 freaking semester.
I told him I can’t quit, I just started and it’s not as if I have not been helping out. During the days I have zoom classes, I will do it while my daughter is on my lap. The only days he has to handle her alone is when I am on campus and it’s 3 hours of school. Husband is easily stressed as a person. He has anxiety attacks whenever I am not around, super introvert person while I am a total opposite.
I am upset that he is not fully on board with me schooling again. He told me if we do not have a daughter, he will be happy for me but now, he can’t and I can’t be mad at him for expressing himself cause that is what he feels and he wants to share it with me. I am conflicted ????

Even a simple ""Thank you for listening to me "" she couldn't hear it right now. We were supposed to meet next year once i finished my school for my graduation trip. Now i only could silently pray she could come back to my dreams. Or maybe when i look up at the skies finding the brightest star, that would be her shining telling me that she is fine up there.

59998,105908,"I have been dating my bf I met on Tinder for 4.5yrs. During the initial phase of seeing each other (non exclusively), I was also seeing another guy (who had a car and often bring me to nice restaurants and offered to fetch me home after dates). I openly told these guys about the other guys that I was seeing and not rushing into a relationship.
So my bf often got anxious whenever I go on dates with other guys and wanted me to be exclusive to him. He would text me everyday and always making plans to meet up. We meet almost every other day since our first date and I began to like him. One day after going on a date with another guy and the guy about to send me home, my bf insisted that I don’t sit my date’s car. He insisted to “fetch” me home by booking a GRAB since he doesn’t have a car.
After seeing his sincerity, I decided to be with him out of the 3 guys I dated. We clicked better in terms of conversations and I like that we share common interest including food and bubble teas.
I also told him that for future dates, we could stick to commuting via public transport as it was unnecessary for him that to take mrt to meet me then book grab to send me home then take mrt again to go to his home.
But after 2nd year together, especially entering the 3rd year, I began to feel that I was taken for granted. He no longer love me and want to go out on dates with me. He is just a lazy person who refuses to do anything everyday.
Oh ya, I moved in with him during CB because I couldn’t bear being separated from him. I still remember I missed him so much that we decided to meet at Fairprice lol.
I wanted to do things together with him at home, such as cooking, dalgona coffee and diy bbt, but he is always lazy. Then we continued staying together after CB but he just got lazier. He doesn’t even do chores and change bedsheets.
When he wakes up in the morning, he doesn’t brush his teeth. He will just sit at the sofa, scroll FB, Insta, TikTok and play games. Even when it’s lunch time, he still don’t bother to ask me out for lunch. He is just abnormal and doesn’t get hungry.
When I offered to cook, he would sometimes angry that I made the house dirty. I always clean up after that but he still didn’t like that the house gets Smokey. I grow up appreciating my mom’s home cook, I don’t know why he doesn’t. I asked him why he is so unappreciative, I feel a lot of men would have wanted their gf to cook homecooked meals for them. He said he just doesn’t appreciate food and hated eating. I felt very cheated as this was not the person he said he was when we were dating. On our first few dates he always made me believe that we shared the same passion and hobbies. Whenever I ask him out on easy and cheap dates such as cycling or hiking , he’s always disinterested and just wanna stay at home. When I suggest holidays, he would say he want to go on cruise where he can sit and relax.
I have expressed this to him several times but he is still like this. I said his laziness is too extreme that even when he is bored of me, he is even too lazy to break up with me. One day he just hurt my feelings and say “I only want sex and you don’t give that to me” so it got me crying. He apologised after that.
Before the relationship, I told him beforehand that I am a virgin and that my second ex cheated on me because I refused to do pre marital sex with him. He said he understood and willing to wait till after marriage. But then now he behave like that. He said, “u try ask around any Singaporean men willing to date you for 4 years without sex. That’s friend. Not gf bf”.
We have had arguments over (other things) where he left me crying cause I felt like he didn’t give a shit about this relationship. Then he often promise to change but then fall back to be the same person later.
Now ever since that “sex talk” he try to be nice to me again but I don’t know how long he can stay like this before being ignorant again. I don’t know if I should end this and find someone else. Or is it too much to ask for premarital sex today?

60096,106088,"My mum is living her ambitions through me and its suffocating.
I'm a top student with a narcissistic mother. My mother married my dad when she was 20 and never had to work her entire life. She dropped out of school mid way after she met my dad who's much older and was married to him within a year and had me. My father is the one with the brains. He was the top student during his youth.
Even though my mother never worked her whole life, she didn't take care of me when I was young. I was sent to my grandparents home during the weekdays and I only went home during weekends till I started school. Even though I did well in my studies, I was forced to take tuition for every subject. My dad initially objected but caved in after my mum persisted. As time grew, I didn't mind as it's a good reason to be away from home and away from my mum.
My mother is constantly bragging about my achievements to anyone who is willing to hear and its embarrassing. Even though I'm a top student, we come from a humble background and I lived in the same place since the day I was born. It's hard enough to be looked down by the other rich students even though I'm doing better in terms of grades. My mother would embarrass me by trying to talk about me to people who didn't even ask about me. Like my cousin is only in P1 so we have a huge age gap, she would brag about how I was when I was P1 and I'm already past 20. I don't remember what achievement awards that I've collected over the years but she can name them out as though people cared. She is constantly making excuses to why she can't work because of me. As a result of her obnoxious behavior, we are not close to relatives. I am also not close to my cousins as my mum constantly reminded me that they are average students and I should only mix with people who are similar like me. I admit I feel superior to them as I'm a single child and have more attention and money spent on me compared to my less privileged cousins who had to settle for diplomas.
I can't be friends with people she don't approve of. I am not allowed to date. She knows nothing about the courses I'm doing and would always try to lecture me when she knows nothing. I'm not allowed to dress what I like. I'm not allowed a lot of things. She checks my phone whenever she likes and reads my texts. When I'm relaxing she would make snide comments if she think I've rested for too long. I've given up having a social life because she will follow me wherever I go. As a housewife she has no friends and doesn't even cook. My father and I are the ones doing the household chores most of the time. I really wish she find a part time job or meet a friend and get off my back.
I'm studying for my degree now and she would talk about her expectations of my future salary and how much she is going to get from me for all the sacrifices she ""made"" for me. Internally, I really hated the thought of taking over the role of my father to take care of her. She play games on her phone all the time. For a self disciplined person, I really dislike how she's wasting her time too.
I appreciate my father more than my mother because he was the one who did all the financial planning for my studies while my mum was only interested in when is her next holiday and when is her next branded bag coming in. I have no plans to enable my mother next time. I can't wait to graduate, move out and start my own life. Am I being unfilial?

Theres so much more that our Regulators have failed TERRIBLY at when it comes to financial regulations and all they can do now is just shirk any form of responsibility and say it is not their fault. So many things, but lets just start with how our regulators pissed off CZ so badly that Binance completely banned all Singaporeans, forcing Singaporeans to use FTX which was also endorsed by a Temasek investment.

60022,105945,"people think body dysmorphia can only happen to females, but it can happen to males too
from 2018-2021 , i was super focused on my body. i looked at the fitness youtube video and i trained 5-6 times a week at the gym except for circuit breaker. my six packs became very well defined. even my calves are great. i prob can give my singapore a run for his money. but i had to have a clean diet and gave up my social life. the hardest part was food
breakfast - plain oats, 4 hardboiled eggs, 2 tomatoes for breakfast
lunch - i would pack food to school. few scoops brown rice + generous amount of steamed chicken, cucumber slices
dinner - few scoops brown rice again, generous amount steamed chicken, 1 fruit
supper - 2 blocks of plain tofu, another tomato
but deep down i wasnt happy. i craved for hotpot. i craved for midnight prata/thai food supper session with my friends
so i gave in. and i joined my friends for supper and eight month later i am a much happier person. i still can do 15 standard pull ups (full elbow extension, and chin clear the bar by 1 inch at least). my body fat has gone to a more normal 20%. i no longer feel hunger pangs. i gained 8kg. but every ounce is worth it.
always remember looks is external. happiness the most important. plus i feel more energetic now
dont let the instagram models (males or females) cloud your judgement. you have a choice. you do not have to look like them. YOU can choose a happy life

60059,106019,"There’s this cute guy in my tutorial. I EC him for 1 year plus already. He’s a bit weird but the looks make up for it initially.
He was sitting beside me for a lecture and throughout the lecture I felt him staring at me the whole time. I was a bit shy at first but after 15 minutes I turn to my right and look at him then I realised he’s staring intensely at my laptop. I asked him if he’s ok but he didn’t reply me, just keep staring. A bit weird but ok. After a few more minutes I finally ask him “what are you looking at?” Then he said he’s looking at my wallpaper. It’s this pink haired anime girl with horns on the side of her head, I think it’s Anya idk I don’t watch anime but I saw the drawing on my Facebook and thought it’s cute. He started going on a very long rant about spy family or something and going super in depth about the character development I was a bit wtf but he’s cute so I just smiled and nodded.
After the lecture he ask for my number and said that he’ll educate me on anime and send me a list of anime to watch. I thought maybe he’s hinting Netflix and chill so I agreed. The next few days he sent me like a dozen different anime to watch and told me to watch one that just came out because it’s like one of the hottest animes rn? I looked up the synopsis online then pretended that I watched it (I don’t like anime at all) and he was super excited. He invited me to his house to have an anime watch party and I agreed.
Fast forward to his house, super big bungalow in woodlands. We went into his room and it’s full of anime girl posters and figurines which was quite strange because he’s like 20+ already. I sat on his beanbag chair for 1-2 hours while he gave full commentary about some anime movie we were watching. Quite cute to see him geek out over a movie ngl. Afterwards I went to his toilet to pee and when I came out I saw him face planted into the beanbag chair like wtaf??? I was like bro wyd this is getting a bit weird and he pretended that he was looking for something he dropped on the floor. I was a bit creeped out but didn’t want to be rude so I waited for the next anime to end before trying to find an excuse to leave.
15 minutes in I s2g I saw him angle his phone camera to my feet and take a pic. Can’t confirm if he took the pic but it was super obvious. I immediately WhatsApped my friend to call me and pretended that I had a family emergency and I left. He tried asking me over a few more times but I told him I’m busy because I don’t want to be rude and ghost him.
Idk what to do because he’s not a bad guy but I think he has some very weird habits and his anime obsession is a bit out of hand please advise?

60052,106001,"Hi everyone, I am the OP of https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/105979.
Unsurprisingly, many bash me for being a gold-digger, whereas some support my sentiment – I thank you for that. Given the economic turbulence, I am deeply concerned about our financial state, and I can’t help but worry about our future.
A bit of context about myself: I grew up in a poor household where my family had difficulty making ends meet. My dad is a compulsive gambler, whereas my mom is a shm. My dad would rack up tons of debt each month and expect others to pay it off for him. Living with him was a complete nightmare. I was taught the value of money at a very young age. I had scrimped and saved to clear the pilling debt and ensure that we had the money for food. I see entering university as an option to escape this situation and be free of financial woes. During my time at the university, my friends would travel overseas and speak fervently about their experiences. I am immensely jealous of their financial ability and had difficulty dealing with such emotions. While I am busily hustling with multiple part-time jobs in SG, I am constantly reminded of how my life would turn out if I were to be born into privilege and be able to do whatever I want.
Life wasn’t entirely unfair for me. I had two suitors back in uni. One of them was from biz whom I met in an orientation camp. We had good chemistry. He is quick-witted and good with words. However, silly me decided not to see my feeling till the end as I am still acclimatizing to the new uni environment, which I find difficult due to imposter syndrome. Then there comes the tech boom. Rumour has it that computing students commanded a high starting pay upon graduation. I took up basic computing mods for fun, hoping to make new connections. I instantly regretted it. Programming mods are easily some of the toughest courses in uni, and I had to stay up late and rely on my peers for assistance. I recalled approaching the prof if there were any “shortcuts” to succeed in this field without going through this grueling learning process, to which he cheekily replied: “Just go get a CS boyfriend, lah.” Despite the ridicule, I took his advice, and true enough, I met my current boyfriend in an organized session for CS student to network and find love.
I must admit, my boyfriend is not the most handsome and charismatic among the guys I encountered. His earning potential mainly attracts me. He stan his prof so much and views him as a supreme sorcerer. He is heavily influenced by his view and is bullish on the prospect of FAANG. He would coerce me into investing my hard-earned money into FAANG and some unknown cryptos with assurances that they would yield positive returns. His obsession with FAANG eventually earned him a spot in FB at SV, which I am happy for him. He then moved to California to pursue the opportunity while I stayed in SG, hoping I would join him as soon as he had settled. The first few years were rosy as our careers soared and our investments peaked. It was not long before all good things came to an end.
Fast forward to today, I received news that he was let go with no concrete plans moving forward. He is on a work visa and will have to return to SG if he cannot secure another job there. His refusal to return home and work in SG leaves our future uncertain. I suspect my income alone cannot sustain us for long s as I am drawing a mediocre wage. Despite the circumstance, he remained optimistic and unbothered about our financial position. Last I checked, he solicited money from his relatives along with his severance to short cryptos to turn the tide. He promised them he would double their money in a couple of days which I find hard to believe.
It is difficult to fathom how someone smart enough to enter FAANG has landed himself in such a plight, completely derailed and out-of-touch with the world. I am now left with a delusional boyfriend and a broken portfolio down by 70%. Due to my constant struggle with money, I felt as if I had reverted to square one and began to doubt my decision to choose my boyfriend over the biz chap from orientation. I would sometime browse his Instagram to see how he was doing. Seeing how he is often on vacation with his wife and making luxurious purchases made me green with envy as it is the kind of life that I have been working so hard for all this while.
I understand it is a long post, and I ultimately only have myself to blame for how things have transpired the past couple of days - just wanna rant and seek some comfort in these trying times.

60090,106083,"Just random relationship thoughts.
If you’re wondering why your partner’s efforts/interest in your rs have declined drastically since the start of your rs (like say, maybe a year) for no good reason [key point] even though they absolutely swept you off your feet at the start, I would like to introduce you to the concept of love bombing: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/style/love-bombing.html
There are no guarantees about your partner being a narcissist but it is important to have some self-awareness to know when a person actually loves/values you vs them entrapping you with disingenuous romantic actions at the start of the rs that manipulate you into gaining feelings for them, only for them to use your feelings for them, against you.
It’s easier said than done ofc, but if your partner disregards your emotions/concerns when you bring up this change, have the self-respect to walk away. You deserve someone who values who you are as a person and as a partner.

You can't justify toxic behaviour from an elder simply because he/she is an elder - especially parents. Like seriously, what the fuck is wrong with y'alls boomer brains? My parents provided for me when I'm young therefore they have the rights to be toxic towards me? Controlling? Gaslighting? Abusive?
Like c'mon, as parents you're f-ing bringing your kid into this world, you should be guiding them to a path that's BEST SUITED for them, letting them EXPLORE what they want to do with their life. Your kid has his/her own life, and their life is not yours. You've already had your own life to lead, don't try to f-ing lead your unfulfilled dreams through your kid.
Seriously, I can't stand these conservative mindsets. ""Oh I put food on the table for you hence I get to dictate your life."" Uh bitch, a big fat no? That's a basic need and pretty much a big damn consequence of wanting to have a child, not an entitlement for you to dictate your child's life.

To the op with a gambling boyfriend of 2.5 years.
I used to have a boyfriend who gambles. I left him after 2 years as I could no longer see a future with him. And the reason was not just about the gambling but also a collective pattern in his behavior that made me decided to leave him.
He is with friends with people who gamble. His family members also gamble. They moved houses a few times because of loan sharks. He told me he hated his dad for gambling and making his mum suffer and being forced to work 2,3 jobs to keep the house running. They gamble in hundreds and thousands per session depending on the game. He has a bad temper but has never flared up at me in those 2 years of being together but I have seen him get angry at his friends and family and it was an ugly side of him. I wouldn't dare to make him angry. He uses and abuse his weaker friends and sucks up to friends who are more powerful and richer than him. I hated the way he treated service staff. He uses index and middle finger to pass card or cash. Soon I realised his entire family member does that so it's a learnt behavior.
I spent hours and hours watching him play. Some days he lose some days he win. He plays with people he hate and also with people he like. Sometimes someone will accuse him of owing them $500 or $1000 when he don't even remember and he would just pay even when his bank account is left with $50. When he wins he splurge and treats everyone for a meal or drinks. He gambles not only the weekends but also during weekdays after work. Sometimes I pay for meals, dates and transport when he is broke. He has never tried to borrow money from me and I've never offered.
One day I just had a revelation. I want out and I started to spend less and less time with him. I got no balls to tell him to his face that I do not want to become his mother and suffer. The week when we broke up he took a while to realise why I left without me saying the truth. He told me he quit gambling but I never believed him.
This happened in my early 20s. 2.5 years is enough of a time for you to decide if your bf is worth sticking around for. From the way you talked about him, I think you know the answer already. Gambling aside, you would not want a gaslighting husband. Good times everyone can be nice. Don't be blinded. Look at everything as a whole. What matters more is during the hard and bad times, what does he choose to do?
Your future children can't choose who their father is but you can. Choose wisely.

60057,106014,"Many people seem to think that CS is a very good course. I am sorry to say that CS is not a good course at all.
CS has always been shunned by students in the past (before 2014). And 1 of the very main reasons is because CS is at the cutting edge of technology and it gets obsolete very quickly. Ageism is very true in the software industry.
As a GP or lawyer, your value increases substantially over the years and your salary/earning power also increase significantly over time. As a SWE, you start off with relatively high salary but it stagnates quickly as your value goes down over the years as the tech stacks you know gets obsolete.
To prospective students, please think carefully before you join CS!

He is the one who suggests to go exclusive. However this exclusive period for 7 months, he didn’t ask if he wants me to be his gf but we are just like in a relationship. He will introduce me to his friends and biological sisters, travel together, buy me airticket whenever I say “I miss home (Malaysia)”, delivers me food whenever I work late, links his credit card to my grab app and even talks to me about BTO.
I got quite confused and asked him few times, “what are we?” He always just shrug off the topic or just say something like “whatever you think we are.” I am a bit insecure recently because he is always on his phone these days when we date and sometimes tilted his phone away from me (which he never done that before).
Yes, monetary wise he showered me a lot, and of course I buy him things too. Emotionally, I would say he tries to comfort me whenever I am angry at him but after apologising he will just say “I have apologise, what you want me to do?” Or “you’re just too sensitive, think whatever you like la.” And the next day after our arguments, he text like normal again.

60074,106043,"I first met him when we were 13yo in sec sch and we both had what everyone calls it puppy love for each other but we never exactly got together. We remained friends throughout our sec sch phase and we went on a short grad trip with a whole bunch of our classmates.
It was during the grad trip that the feelings for him resurfaced again and I could feel that there was some kind of sexual tension seeing how we both wanted to be close to each other but we didn’t cos we were both afraid of our friends “disturbing” us. Nothing happened during the trip other than that invisible pull between us. We texted here and there after the trip but had never addressed what we felt towards each other.
We moved on to different tertiary schools, drifted off from each other and he subsequently found a girlfriend. They seemed really cute together and I was genuinely happy for him. I guess because we never really started anything, I didn’t felt heartbroken or anything of that sort about it.
Then one day we bumped into each other and started texting again. It was friendly texts catching up with our lives and no flirting was involved. We met up one night and somehow ended up at his place because I needed the restroom. We were watching some stuff on my phone when he started to snatch my phone away and like how dramas usually go, we ended up tickling and hugging each other (cringey af, I know). It started to get really late and I was sleepy. I never had the intention of sleeping over when we met up for the night but ended up sleeping over anyway. Nothing sexual happened that night other than hugging each other to sleep.
I went home the next morning and we met up again that night. He was the one that requested to meet up again but of course the stupid me didn’t reject his request. We ate out and again went over to his place. I spent the night again and this time we had sex with each other. I went home the next morning and we didn’t meet for the next few days because he had some orientation camp stuff to attend to for a few days.
He said he missed me and all those nonsense shit. But he posted an Instagram post thanking his girlfriend for being the sweetest human being by his side. And that’s when I realized how stupid I had been to allow my feelings to take control instead of my brain.
Yes, I knew he hadn’t broken up with his girlfriend when I stayed over the first night. He told me they were in a Cold War and the situation wasn’t great. The naive me believed him. I should have known better.
I stopped replying him when his IG post went out and he texted me saying he can’t bear to break his girlfriend heart and seeing her cry is the worst thing ever. honestly, I wasn’t expecting him to break up with the girlfriend and be with me. I just didn’t expect that he was such a douchebag and never once apologized for leading me on. I eventually sent him a text about my feelings, how I didn’t meant to be the third party, how messed up we had been, how I realized that I have always been in love with him since 13 and he had always been my kryptonite. He didn’t acknowledge my feelings and I didn’t reply anything to him after that.
Few months later, I posted a Snapchat on feeling stressed about school work and he replied my snap to ask me to go over his place. I was completely dumbfounded and speechless by this guy. How could he be so… fucked up? I ignored his snap and we never talked since then.
It has been at least 5 years since this incident and it took me a long time to fully get over the guilt of sleeping with an attached guy and I also became paranoid with my partners on whether they will be secretly be sleeping with another girl without me knowing. I guess you can call that karma but I will fully accept that fate if it happened to me because I know I deserved it for what I’ve done.
For that guy, he has married that girlfriend that he cheated on with me. I don’t know if he has ever told her the truth or if he had slept with other girls in between. I know I am an awful person but I hope that his wife will someday cheat on him and leave him at his lowest. Or that he may never have kids, ever. Guys like him shouldn’t reproduce. And maybe girls like me shouldn’t too. Oh well.
Sorry for lousy grammar and the long rant. Just needed to get this out and finally close this chapter in my life.

60010,105928,"I'm a NUS alumni and current a Senior Manager for one of the biggest IT Firm. Just last week I met guys from my batch, most of whom were hiring manager in reputable firms.
In our conversation we realize we have the same serious issue, and our solutions to that is exactly the same, but we're still not getting results.
We have a talent shortage. Our solution is high salary, head hunt and expand to non-CS people.
What we found out were the same, most of the fresh grads are not qualified for the job, cannot perform under stress, fail deadlines and leaves between 6 - 12 months. It isn't that we didn't vet our candidates, we have rigorous interviewing process, with in-person coding test, personality test and a 60-90k package for fresh grad, much more if you've xp. On average only less than 10% manage to go into final round of interview. Yet 80% leaves within the first year without producing any good results, and those who stayed on would have another offer lined up by their third year. University and GPA are poor indicator, in fact I had xp with a few poly student out performing NUS FCH but leaves due to better offer, our company refuse to pay non-degree holder more than 50k per annum. Some of the wiser among readers can guess my firm.
We also realize that many younger candidates, <5 yrs xp, has an average of 1 yr tenure but virtually same as fresh grads. Despite that many still demand high salary, we think GES is partly to blame. Interestingly, we also realized that a particular group of them were also willing to accept a much lower package for a less demanding role, I guess their xp have traumatize them. Tracking our ex employees, we realize that about half of those who couldn't handle it change to a different field and a sizable portion took easier roles.
Those >5 yrs xp is a huge mix bag but many have unrealistic expectation due to how high we're offering fresh grads. The most Inspirational case I came across was this one candidate who asked for a 70% jump from his previous salary because a particular ecommerce was listing high salary for fresh grads and he feels that he should get 20% on top of that, he barely pass our coding test with his 4 years xp. I do not blame him, the market is broken because there is just not enough talent.
To put my point across, in my company we track the progress and output of every SWE. Last year, 53% of the productivity is created by 16% of the team. All of them are in the senior or lead position, all of them are overwork and burned out. Those <5yrs xp represent 58 % of the team but only accounts for 27% productivity with one unicorn responsible for ~3% productivity. To be fair, about half of them were hired last years, they account for 7% productivity.
I don't know what's wrong with our education system, but we aren't creating talents or hard workers.

60081,106058,"We just decided to tie the knot! While this is typically a happy occasion for most, we are now hit with our biggest obstacle as a couple so far - housing affordability.
We are lucky/unlucky to be ineligible to BTO. We are in our mid-30s, have been slogging at our jobs for some time and for now, we have exceeded the $14,000 income ceiling (emphasis: for now!)
Typically, this would not be a big deal and we would just pay a tolerable premium to get a resale flat. Unfortunately, the huge run up in the last 2-3 years have driven this premium up to levels that no longer make sense. We are talking about $150K-$200K increases on average here.
As a side-rant to this, the current BTO system and the lottery effect creates a group of ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" (something that PM Lee cautioned against) with no meritocratic basis AT ALL.
We are extremely fearful of what is to come w.r.t. the economy.
- We both work in tech and are worried about our future incomes if the current climate persists.
- We are now in our mid-30s and do not have the luxury of a long time horizon.
- We started financial planning late in life and have not moved much due to our inexperience. We are aggressive savers who only started investing recently, and faced more losses than gains. Fortunately, we were conservative and the losses are not crippling.
- The economy looks to be forced into either a deep recession or hyper-inflation - neither of which are good outcomes. This is relevant to the options we intend to explore.
- Interest rates could go anywhere from here -- including much higher and much longer than predicted.
- Singapore has to continue to do well in order for us to maintain value in our property. There is no denying that we will be encountering further headwinds.
- We used to view housing as a necessary expense that we want to spend a prudent amount on. That means buying an affordable home that meets our needs, saving and investing the rest for our families and future.
These are the options we have before us, and none of them look good. Hoping to get your perspectives and advice.
1. Buy a resale flat now and pay the asking price. We aren't very savvy investors, but were aggressive savers. This means interest rates are less of a concern, but we will have less investable cash and assets as a result. Two ways to go about it -
1a. Buy a flat within our means and meets our needs, even if it means spending more in today's market - convenient location, close enough to MRT so we save on buying a car, long enough lease that we don't kick the can down to lease decay.
1b. Buy a flat below our means and suffer temporarily. Ulu place, new-ish flat so that lease decay is manageable. Wifey may not be too happy about this long-term, so we need to exit from this position well in 5 years, hopefully. Because common wisdom dictates ""happy wife, happy life.""
2. Wait, see and hope that prices become more rational. Live with parents first, buy later when flats hopefully become cheaper. The Government should be doing something about this, right? 15-month wait out period for downgraders is for them to create a corrective policy (one can only hope)? Right?
There is an element of risk here in timing the market. Prices may never revert to normal levels in the near term and we incur the costs of (1b), enjoying the home later and still end up paying more.
3. Buy a new launch EC. Sounded like a good plan until we realized that the PSF has also shot up crazily in recent years. The current ones run around $1,300-1,400 PSF. Interest rates are crazy now, but like we said, we are prudent savers and have the option of borrowing some from family to pay more upfront in cash so that we are less leveraged.
Side note: It is said that ECs are heavily subsidized by the Gov, but looking at these prices, we find that hard to believe.
This is a very aggressive option that makes us uncomfortable, given that we are conservative and are not speculators. However, it could make sense for the following reasons:
- The other housing options are clearly overpriced/risk being still overpriced after waiting.
- If there is a high chance of deploying our savings into this to keep pace with inflation. While we feel this is overpriced too, unlike the other options, it has a better chance of keeping pace with inflation, which is one of our bigger worries.
Our arguments against this:
- Property is generally a good hedge against inflation. But there are many other factors that determine a property's current and future price. We don't want to overpay for a hedge, but how do we know?
- This is one singular, concentrated bet that could do well/poorly/nothing at all. If it does nothing at all, that's still a loss given the huge opportunity cost.
tl;dr: Need home, not now but soon. Gov said we cannot BTO due to income ceiling, but we are worried about future income. Saved hard to expand our range of options, but all of them don't look like very good financial decisions in current climate, yet current climate could persist or even worsen. How ah?

60002,105913,"[Follow-up for #105869] Hello everyone, I'm the fresh grad guy that was stuck between the 90k and 70k job. Even though i know most of you dont care [LOL each man for his own!] I thought I would share my decision and thought process, in case anyone ever get stuck in my position too. Many thanks to Prof Ben and others who responded thoughtfully!
Ultimately I decided the 90k Job [Sorry Prof Ben! NGL, Your comment made me hesitate greatly. I almost chose the 70k option when I think back about your comment! And yes you've rightfully pointed out that im part of the 80% and not one of those chiongters. Met some of them during CS days. Its hard to imagine how to really catch up]
Like some people have rightfully guessed, the 70k job is related to consulting. Without delving too deep [yall are too good at stalking], it was in a role which required frequent travels but not technical. I always thought it would be fun to do different projects as well [less monotonous bro]! Frankly the starting pay wasn't too bad [~5.5k per month w bonuses]. More then enough for my current lifestyle. With consulting job comes certain skillset [Idk, smoking skills? HAHA] and I thought IR skills was definitely transferable [in case I want to continue working on IR related jobs]. Of course, I nv worked a day in consulting before and I heard the life is pretty shit and intense. But still if I don't try, I would never know right? Most importantly, this role does not always present itself (dont ask me how i got through the interviews. Sometimes you get luck). If not now, then when? What if I never get a similar opportunity anymore? My CS Job won't be able to help me travel around even!
But what pushed me to decide the 90k Job is as follows:
1. If my early career does not define my life, why not take this chance to earn cash and improve on my technical skills [which is truly, indispensable in today's digital age]
2. With the cash [and ETF investment. Lord praise the US markets. Ok but for real, hope the world becomes a better place so everyone flourishes and my etf flourishes as well] I can build up my ""Fk you"" money. And at the same time, build up on my resume so I am wanted *everywhere*
3. Am I giving up on my dream job? Hell no! I will simply postpone it! I am early in my career! If i can afford to take a risk on possible setbacks from the consulting job, i can equally take the risk of giving up this opportunity and HUNT for one next time.
Yes opportunities doesn't always come. The consulting role I mentioned isn't always available. And they may not even consider me next time. But the onus is on me then. I will improve. Be better. And be on a consistent look out. That's why I decided to give up on this opportunity, and look for another one who would be willing to compensate similarly in the future. Maybe as a fresh grad, 70k was all they were willing to pay. But what if i came back with more experience? Make myself worth that much in the future!
So with that, goodbye dream consulting job [for now]. I'll be back. And my final advice for those who may be in a similar crossroad. As everyone said, there's no right choice! There are only different perspectives. For me, I was only willing to give up my dream job because someone reminded me this : ""This won't be the only job that you get to travel. You're not giving up on this opportunity, you're giving yourself a chance to seek for a better opportunity. The world is large. If you truly want it again, you can and should hunt for it again. Get some cash ready to prepare for your next fight"". So my final advice is as follows: ""Don't give up on an opportunity because it's not the ""best"". There would always be a better one. But definitely don't accept a deal that is objectively worse off"".
That's all folk. It's a long WoT. Perhaps a way for me to convince myself I made the right choice. But hey who cares. I will be buying my S22 Ultra for the ITZY concert now! Thanks for reading. Great luck to all your careers my fellow students!

60100,106096,"TLDR; Got ghosted after a 2 month situationship and I don't know how to save this rs. I don't want to ask for closure or just end things, but want to give her a way to start talking again without feeling the pressure to explain herself. Or if I'm the reason she's ghosting, I want to talk it out with her and try to fix things. How should I talk to her about this?
So I met a girl and it's pretty obvious we have mutual interests in each other. We text every day and go out every week, we reciprocated each other's flirting and physical touch. We were damn sweet like the kind that'll cook for each other, prepare surprise gifts or like stand there to watch each other leave when saying goodbye
I was planning to confess but out of no where she hasn't replied for 10 days and ignored all texts to meet. I triple texted her already. I feel like she's intentionally cutting it off.
I know if she really intends to cut that I should just let it go and not pester her but it really feels sad to let this go like this. I rlly value her and want to at least try to save this rs, please dun tell me to just leave her in the comments :')
She's also the quiet, shy, non-confrontational type, if I don't reply it will probably just fizzle out. I don't think I should pressure her to explain the ghosting cause she will prob be too shy to explain the real reason. And if she feels too pressured or awkward it might ruin any opportunity to start talking again in the future (say after finals when she's in a better headspace)
I just thought we're off to a good start, but I hope we can talk things out to see if there's any misunderstanding or if there's anything I can do to change or make things right. Honestly if it's because she saw some red flag in me, I'd like to see if it's something I can do to change. How can I communicate with her without sounding needy or stressful to her?
Admins please help this lost soul and dun filter this:( I rlly like her

60105,106105,"I'm not too sure if this is the right place to post. Admin please do not delete this. I really need some insight regarding this issue.
I'm a female 24, graduated from NUS about a year ago. To all the female solo travellers, I would like to know if this has ever happen to any of you before and how do ya'll react to this.
As with the majority of the solo traveller, we tend to stay at a hostel due to its cheap rates. I have been solo travelling and staying in hostel most of the time. Often I do not faced any issue and find it to be very very safe.
However, recently while I was backpacking to Thailand and staying in a hostel, I found out that a few of my bra, panties and clothes were stolen. What's worst was that some of my used bra and panties had cum stain in them. I was utterly shock as this had never happened to me before. I tried to tell the hostel staff but they said they could not do anything about it as they have placed a disclaimer to remind the tenants to take care of their belongings. They did offered to make a police report but that didn't help much as I was about to head home in a few days. Looking through the CCTV also didn't help as there were multiple people entering the room at different times, making it hard to tell who stole exactly.
What's worst was that there's this other female tenants whose lingerie was stolen and stain with cum as well.
I just want to know if this is common or has every happen to other solo female traveller before. If so, how do ya'll react to such situation? What are your next precautionary steps.

We clicked instantaneously (at least it seemed so) and the few 2-3 months were full of happy daily texts and occasional dates. Things went downhill subsequently because you had too many partners (took me too long to realise) to manage and whatever I was asking for as a date always seem to be too much of an expectation.
It’s been a year and I’m still very much left heartbroken, but yet I still think of you and miss you every single day. I wanted you back despite being hurt many times and how you made me feel so worthless at times.
I wonder if you will ever get to read this but I just want to tell you that the silly ygf still wants you badly, and as long as you’re willing to change and be honest, I’ll always be there for you.

60089,106066,"Should I feel guilty for allowing my bf to dote on me? I have been together with my bf for 1+ years. He has always been the perfect gentleman to me, and we talk about having a future together. He likes to spoil me E.g. taking me out to expensive restaurants for special occasions (almost 4 digit bill). One time, I went on a solo trip (his company had an emergency) and he upgraded my flight to first class as he felt bad for ditching me. After he got a promotion at work, he gave me a big angpao to thank me for being a supportive gf. When I had a really bad sore throat from COVID, he bought me a few jars of high grade manuka honey. When I saw the invoice I almost got a heart attack!
As I come from a relatively humble background, I am unused to such spending habits- growing up, even buying fresh milk at NTUC was considered a luxury.
I feel particularly uncomfortable as my salary is significantly lower than his and I can’t afford to reciprocate at the same level. My parents always taught me ”拿人手短，吃人嘴软” (if you spend someone else’s money, you’re indebted to them) and never accepted expensive gifts. One of my more cynical (and socialist) friends thinks he just likes showing off his bourgeoisie tastes and that he’s basically buying me like I’m a product by throwing money at me.
I’m conflicted as to how I feel about this. On the one hand, I feel very lucky to have such a doting boyfriend who would be considered a catch by many. Although he’s not super handsome by conventional standards, he is quite fit and dresses well. He also has a great sense of humour and is very popular with colleagues and friends. I think he would make a great father to our future children. I can’t lie and say that i don’t enjoy being pampered once in a while, and I also can’t fault him for his spending habits as he has more than enough savings and revenue streams for a financially comfortable future. However, I also can’t get rid of the nagging sense of guilt at the back of my mind everytime he splurges on me, especially given our vast contrast in earning power. Is it problematic for me to continue accepting his gifts while giving much less in return?

60000,105909,"Things that are wrong about the medical school system (things I observed and feel angry that these things are happening to other classmates)
Please deidentify and make it less obvious so the writer does not get into trouble. Thank you!
1) Classmates are arrogant, don’t know also pretend and put a front
2) Classmates prefer to gossip, if not be by themselves and be selfish. Avoid helping others even if others are clearly facing difficulties or struggling in school work, say “the school doesn’t spoonfeed” “everyone is studying the same thing, I don’t get it why you can’t and are spending so much time on this”
3) Too many classmates who are putting up a façade and entering Medical School for the wrong reasons. E.g. former policy maker entering school cos “money goes to school rather than MOH”, former pharmacist wants to seek revenge on doctors who scolded her when she was once a pharmacist. Entering for the prestige and reputation of the school. Friends who are “friends” – want to be friends with those who have benefits only, emotional dumpers, psychopaths who are shape shifters and subsume others’ personalities – copycats, and not sure what to label them, “the school is out to get us/cockblocks us”
4) “Friends” who don’t share learning experiences and struggles openly
5) Pretend nothing is wrong despite knowing that some things are the truth, such as gaslighting and brushing other people’s feelings aside after hurting them “get over it”, “roll with it”, brushing others' concerns and thoughts aside. Ironically students are taught to explore ideas, concerns and expectations of patients and be more empathetic
6) Showmanship is more valued in Medicine rather than being humble, quiet and actually knowing your stuff. Erosion of values that medicine once upheld, such as professionalism, punctuality.
7) If you stand out because of your kindness or something good in your personality, people gossip and get jealous and try all means to bring you down
8) Mentors who like to show off and scold/nag when they themselves don’t know certain things, not nurturing or encouraging
9) Lack of proper guidance in school, a lot of comments are not useful for learning e.g. “maybe you’re from (this previous background) you question things less” “How can you be so blur” “You’re awkward” VS in other schools, a sentence by other mentors can be enlightening and motivate the student in the right direction, the student knows what exactly to do just 5 minutes talking to the mentor
10) People say not bowing to such negative influence and becoming bad is growth, but how long can you stay positive and principled in such an environment?
11) People are judgmental, just because people are short and small-sized doesn’t mean they are easy to bully or don’t know their stuff. People don’t take others seriously because of their personality or appearance e.g. “this girl is nipple line” “she lacks emotional quotient” when they are actually projecting their past hurts or trauma in their previous lives /careers on innocent classmates who are just there to study and not hurt anyone

It does not help that she often likes to wear tight-fitting grey clothing or a light-colored shirt and therefore the wet patches are very obvious. And mind you - it is not that she is working out; we could be in an LT attending a lecture together and I could see wet patches forming with a musty sour odour
Sometimes it is soaked to the extent that the fabric sticks to her skin. Worse when she wears white and her skin and undergarments become see-thru. She has tried deodorant and even putting pads on her armpits but the sweat seeps thru.
Do you think she has hyperhidrosis? How should I approach this? Frankly, I don't find that too much of an issue but I'm afraid my reputation will take a hit when I go out with her. Anybody here can give health advice? I'm in a dilemma!

Recently on one of the sugaring sites, a guy messaged me and the vibe was quite good so I agreed to meet him for a date to see if we can hit it off. My heart was palpitating a bit when he arrived in a lambo to pick me at my block and he whisked me off to a nice michelin star restaurant.
In terms of looks, he is about average but we got along quite well and had a nice time. He said he was a trader and was very comfortable moneywise but not looking for any commitment which was great as I am still studying and don't want anything serious. After that night, I thought he would make a proposition for an arrangement but there was no contact from him for almost a week. Suddenly, he popped up again on tele and asked me out for another date. The same thing happened again and in total we went for 4 dates. It was a sense of deja vu as the dates went well but never got intimate. On the last date tho', we were at a scenic restaurant looking at the Marina bay view when he came up from behind, hugged me and kissed me. He looked into my eyes and said he loved me but we never progressed beyond that. He sent me back after and that was the end.
The next day, I msg him to thank him and asked if he was serious about having an arrangement with me but no reply.
Still no reply after a day so I decided to test him. I said that I really liked him and wanted to have sxx with him but he would have to commit to an arrangement with a regular allowance. He finally replied and said that he is game for a 'trial' makeout session but he would not compensate me and would make decision about an arrangement after that. I replied that he told me he loved me and even kissed me. What more does he need to make up his mind? After that, there was silence from him. I decided then to just block him on tele but a week after that I got a message from him on the sugaring site saying he misses me and wants to discuss further.
Should I give him a chance or is he just taking me for a ride (literally and figuratively) in his lambo?

Regarding my gambling bf. Thanks for sharing your story. And all the comments regarding my post. Appreciate all the positive and negative comments. I feel so nice writing here as I don’t really talk to my frns abt this kind of stuff.
So it all started when he get to know my brother in law and his friends. I brought him to meet my family members during cny. He got close to my brother in law real quick through poker. My bro in law was playing poker with his frns and asked if he wanna join too. They started to play poker during cny season, mostly every night. I was mad but i did not say much as he would said aiya, only cny ma. Don’t worry. So I don’t really mind.
My father used to be a gambler but then he started to change at one point of life. Idk when but i rmb was quite old like 50s? Now he is in 70s. He always regretted he gamble so much and wish he could save more money. Now he is retired and i am supporting to pay all the utility and bills with 2 of my sisters. 2 of my bros do not save money and often borrow money from us. Now my father has changed. Im grateful for that. But the worst part is, now my mum is the one keep gambling away all the money. She often borrow money from family member to pay back all the debts. Idk how much she owe but I am so tired keep nagging her over the same thing. So from my background, you can see that I don’t really like gambler. I always help them and feel like is my responsibility to help them. Of course the responsibility come with a lot of stress. I sometimes cry out of nowhere.
Some comments mentioned that it’s just a phase and it’s normal that guys play poker as a hobby as it is a probability and social game. I do really hope that it’s just a phase. Sorry for the long story, back to my bf. My brother actually came back from oversea few months back and he kinda knw my bf likes to play poker through my brother in law. So he invited my bf to join so I thought it was ok. One time only ma. And my brother gonna fly soon. Soon i regretted, as everything started from there. They created a whatsapp group and he often play poker like almost every weekend or sometimes even weekdays. He reduces it to 2 days per month now as i used the break up card. If im in a good mood, i would allow him to go more as he will randomly hint me the whatsapp group got ppl jio.
Now my brother fly back oversea dy, he still ply often as he is close to my brother’ frns now. Lmao I don’t even know whether this is a good thing.
Lets talk abt winning. He losses quite alot in the first few mths, paying tuition fees. Often time, he would mentioned that he use alot of money and the fact i know he losses money as he usually don’t mention abt this since he is earning quite a decent salary. He would pay for most of our meals. Even when he losses money, he still bought me a bag and perfume. I would buy expensive gift for him during some occasion as well. He is telling me now he is getting the hang of the poker game and always sharing me the fun thing during the game.
The thing I’m concerned is, he bought a condo and probably can get the house key nx year. If he continues like this, will he able to save up money for renovations and furniture or even house loan. I just feel insecure. We have discussed about this concern of mine and he mentioned that he will control the limit and reassure me that i do not have to worry.
I will give it some time and if this is phase won’t change or is getting worse then i will eventually give up.

People say the change is the only constant, they are wrong, everything in life changes, but there's one constant constant, which is ""death"". It is not worth to give in your 100% into your work or studies after which someone suffer a burnt out or depression, just your 75% will do. Give your quality time to those who matters, they will be the ones who remember when you are gone, not the corporation you worked at, your school, your car, your house or your bank account.
If it's needed, quit your job, quit your school, don't be afraid to try again, because those who matter don't mind and those who mind don't matter, they will always be around to support your decision because they know who you really are.

60028,105952,"What does it take to be a man?
Does it mean that you’re the pillar of strength for your loved ones? The pillar that’s shouldering the emotional baggage’s of your loved ones, while carrying your own on the same pair of shoulders.
Does it mean that every problem ends with me? Whereby I will be reliable enough to solve every problem any loved one experiences. Being the bigger person providing the required solution and perspective.
Does it mean not being able to freely express your emotions because you know that your loved ones are fighting each of their own battle? Constantly looking for the next healthy way of coping with your own emotions, while portraying a perfectly fine exterior.
Does it mean taking that extra breathe before stepping into the house, or walking the longer route so you get an extra moment where nobody can see your defeated state? Not bringing any additional negativity to your loved ones because you know that if you falter, nobody else can be the pillar of strength.
Does it mean accepting the fact that despite these being real feelings, some people might still think that it’s immature of a guy to vent his feelings here? Not knowing the behind the scenes struggles and desperation in finding alternative sources of outlets for these negativity.
I guess it’s not easy to be a guy after all, but then again who am I to complain because every one is going through their own struggles, non gender specific. If I don’t try to be the bigger person, the ray of light amongst the darkness, then who will? Do I have any names to recommend? No I don’t. I don’t wish for any of my loved ones to experience what I’ve been through, and hence I WILL shoulder these burdens.
At the end of the day, I do not wish for my burdens to be lighter, I just wish for stronger shoulders.

60023,105947,"As someone who have been in the workforce for a few years now, I am genuinely concerned for students who have just graduated/graduating soon. While they are probably smarter and are more exposed to the world than the previous generations, I wonder how is the situation in terms of insurance nowadays?
Back in the days we take agents' words at face value and believe we are indeed getting good advice. Students, please do some reading before getting insurance! There are many agents out there who are really good at giving half-truths to secure a deal. I have taken losses before in the past and so I do not wish for such things to happen to you????. There are companies like MoneyOwl (I am not affiliated nor paid to do so, but just believe in what they do) that can provide conflict-free advice and they will never push you to buy. Even if you decide not to buy from them you learn what you need and buy from others(your friend or whoever), but at least you probably won't buy unnecessary policies. Think about how many bbts you can buy from saving 3-5k/yr.
My only wish is that future generations of people won't end up paying for unnecessary policies. Moneyowl, please do university outreaches to educate our younger generation????. Alright sorry for the boring rant.
(PS: A loved one just kena from agent which really infuriated me)
(PPS: There are indeed good agents out there, but not everyone may have the luck to meet one or the ability to discern)

60043,105987,"As a PhD student who's been TAing for 3 years, we are aware of how busy and stressed you undergrads are. We know that you're given an excessive amount of workloads. We've been there, so we know your pain and anxiety. And we want to give each and every one of you A or A+ (except for you, Andrew).
With that being said, I implore you to follow the assignment instructions. Please stick to it. There are so many well-written assignments that we persons would like to give A++, but we end up having to give them B or less because they have missed an essential instruction or two. Yes, it makes our job easier in terms of placing you in a bell curve, but it breaks our heart to see all your efforts go to waste.
So please, with all due respect, read the f ing instruction :((

60026,105948,"Part 1 of the Story:
One day, I was at the 7-11 looking for some loose change to get some instant noodle (which happens to be my only meal for the week). Out of a blue, I got a call from some heavily accented guy asking if i wanted to play a game.
He told me that he knows I am unemployed and needed money to repay my student loan. He told me that joining the game, I stand a chance to win a prize that would guarantee me a life where I have free food and good money. I was pretty desperate and asked him for instructions to join the money making game. He told me that I just have to come to some secret place tomorrow morning to join the game (I am bounded by NDA to not disclose this location).
Next morning, I joined a large crowd of young and broke students that were there for the game. After around 30 minutes of waiting, a bunch of fat dudes dressed in black robes strolled into the main hall. They told us to pick and head into a room where a game master will be waiting for us.
All the rooms were labelled with some unknown symbol. One room had a kind looking snake. Another room had a inverted stop sign. There were even room that has multiple animals symbol on it (which includes an cute elephant). Towards the end of the hall way, there was a dimly lit room with an old guy wearing a red hat.
As an elephant lover, I went into the room and sat down quietly. I vaguely recalled answering some questions and drank some java chip mocha frap before getting knocked out by the game master. When I woke up, I was in a large room full of random dudes wearing red hats playing with stuffed animals. Some macho guys are sipping Coffee while playing with stuffed elephants whereas some weaker guys are just playing with some long snakes.

59997,105903,"In a relationship for half a decade and this was what I recently discovered.
For context, I've never checked his phone before. However his behaviour over the last few weeks made me think that he might be hiding smth on his phone.
So this is what I found: He initiates texts with a 'long-time female friend' and offers to hang out constantly. In those texts are msgs like 'i miss your hugs', 'i would give you a hug if I bump into you on the streets' - these are things that he doesnt even say it to me. He's always the one initiating those texts, innocuous ones starting with 'hi', or 'you there?'. She is not responsive, so he will often have to follow up with a second text a few days later.
Their texts are infrequent. Sometimes he texts her right after waking up, other times he texts her late at night, right after we end our late night dates. Many of these texts are him asking whether she's available to meet.
He proceeds to meet said friend without updating me about it (context: we would always update each other where we're headed to and who we're meeting. It's just how we operate as we don't meet often). If she's just a normal friend, why hide it from me? I'm pretty chill with having friends of the opposite sxx and he knows that. We don't give each other shit for things like that.
Before this incident, we've always been open with each other how our week went, who we met during the week and the kind of interactions/conversations we had thoughout the week. I didn't know about this lady until I saw her name pinned right at the top of his telegram chat.
When confronted, he says he loves me and she's just a friend? Then why hide? Why try to cover up his tracks?
I don't understand.

60014,105934,"Am I being an asshole for not wanting to have any relation to my siblings?
So a little a bit of context:
I was never your typical book smart student. My grades in primary school through secondary school was not great. I got 168 for my PSLE and went to NA in a neighbourhood sec sch and for this, I was constantly bullied by my siblings, yes.. my very own siblings, for having poor grades. They constantly called me names such as the 168 girl, NA retard etc. All in front of my parents. What pisses me off and scars me till this day is that my parents did NOTHING about this. All they said is ""Transfer to Express stream and they will stop."" I honestly still hold a grudge against my parents for not doing anything about the bullying I faced from my siblings.
Of course when I stepped into Secondary school, my self confidence plummeted like mad. I became very withdrawn and I hated socialising with people. Went to poly, started doing better.... average GPA of 3.4, went to Uni and now doing my postgrad.
A series of events happened over the past few years with my siblings and my parents have been trying to persuade me to step in to talk to them and advice them. However, I refuse to. I do not want to have any relation to them. Neither do I want to have anything to do with them. Over the years I was met only with hostility and they did jack shit to help me so now I am thinking, why should I?
So, am I being an asshole/petty for not wanting to have any relation to them?

60008,105925,"Moderator, please do not censor this. I am from a country that is run by a dictator. Last month he renew his term.
Things are getting from bad to worst. My parents tell me to migrate here and never come back. I'm doing my last year in NUS, I am very afraid of not getting a job, I have a GPA of 3.50+. Country going back to 50 years ago, if I go back there is no job, I will be send to farm or worst. If war happen in my country, I will be send and I will die.
I am also worried for my parents, they are rich in our city (~3k sgd per month), but that not enough for them to migrate. They got no saving because covid. They do not understand English at all.
I cannot talk to my friends, we all same country. I don't know who can trust, I get trouble if they report.
Can any one teach me how to get Singaporean citizenship for my family? My parents cannot go through what will come again, they might die. We need help.
