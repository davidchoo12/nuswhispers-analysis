60461,106818,"Everyone has a story, this is mine.
My dad passed away when I was a teenager. Before he fell sick he and my mom got a divorce. Their split was horrid and traumatic for me because I witnessed a lot of violent physical fights. I can still remember he held a knife and wanted to attack my mom. He swung and slammed the door into her and she let out a terrifying scream. Both of them are bad tempered and toxic towards each other. I witnessed all these when I was below the age of 10. I suffered from PTSD for years.
I remember feeling helpless and terrified whenever they start fighting. I forgot the number of times the police showed up because of all the yelling and screaming. Sometimes there's blood on the floor at the scene where they fought. This was how I remember the bulk of my childhood.
My mother is literally a crazy woman as a single parent. In today's day and age, I guess she can be called a bipolar, narcissist, borderline or maybe all of the above. She had no one to fight and argue with so she would regularly unleash all her emotions onto us, especially me, because I'm a female. When I hit puberty, she became more violent towards me. I was not rebellious. I studied hard, but she was never proud of me.
None of our needs mattered. All our birthdays were meant to celebrate her instead. Because that was the day she suffered to give birth to us. Every holiday was supposed to treat her like a queen because she deserves a break. She only cared about controlling us no matter how unreasonable and nonsensical the request is because we owe her our lives. She was not happy even when we followed her instructions. This was how I remember my teenage years.
I was always mentally preparing myself for her to explode on me. To be battered mentally and physically is the norm. There was no way out as I can't bear to leave my younger sibling alone with her. In a sense, I became a mother to my younger sibling. I fed and supported my younger sibling the moment I could because my mother abandoned all her responsibilities to 'find herself'.
She went on to have affairs with married men. Travelled out of sg for months, in the name of love. Lucky I already learnt how to cook by age 11. I remember bawling my eyes out when she left home with her luggage. I was 13. How tf do kids run a home for months without any adult? But we survived.
When her mood comes, she would go on a rampage and say we are cursed and we will grow up to lead the same kind of life like her. She hated our existence because she lost her freedom, her youth, her everything. For a while, I actually believed her that I should not exist.
Took me decades to understand why she hated me. I didn't end up having a lousy life as she expected. I found a job that I love and actually enjoy. I met someone, married and lived a totally different life from hers. I have long term friendships unlike her. All of us are leading peaceful lives now.
She is wrong about all of us.
Don't believe everything your parents tell you. They aren't always right. Never believe you are doomed to walk in their footsteps. There's always a chance to change your destiny.

60410,106731,"Today will be my last day in Singapore for a long time.
This is my (33M) first time posting on NUSWhispers so do forgive me if my formatting looks weird ah. Growing up I always wanted the Singaporean Dream, to find a nice girl, get married, have kids, BTO in a decent neighborhood, etc. But life is unexpected and I found myself more and more detached as time went by - let me just share why.
One of the first wake-up calls was when I was discussing getting a BTO with my ex. When we actually looked at the figures, we realised that if we wanted to balance saving for old age and paying off loans, it would take a good couple decades to pay off everything. Renovations, furniture, etc... the figures added up and it looked really daunting. For us folks with a more humble background (3-4k take home), this was a subtle reality check- at one point we looked at our finances and decided with heavy hearts that we might not be able to fulfil our dream of having kids before 35. It was during COVID that our relationship was fraught with more financial difficulties, and we parted amicably.
The pandemic was a double-edged sword. I managed to keep my job, but the workload only got worse even though I was working from home. I was at home, there but not there. I believe I can speak for almost everyone in my age group when I say that we all became jaded and upset with our lives and our jobs during that period. The rat race only intensified for my colleagues and I, and I kept asking myself- is this the Singapore Dream?
During that time, I was dating actively on Tinder. I found that many Singaporean girls are just too similar to each other, and in a fashion that wasn't to my taste. Yes, Singaporean guys only hike and gym. But Singaporean girls always have the same movie quotes or some random MBTI/Horoscope sign on their Tinder profile. They have the same interests and conversations. Political views were never diverse- in fact, many girls don't think about politics, as it isn't their interest. I don't think we can blame anyone for that- Singapore is just too small, and lacks space for us to explore hobbies and interests. We all end up liking the same stuff, watching the same shows, and we all end up feeling that a trip to Don Don Donki is an adventure. But after breaking up with whom I thought I would spend my life with, I felt like I didn't want to lower my bar anymore.
I had a friend who went to Israel during his NOC days and stayed there afterwards for his work. I visited him there once the pandemic died down, and he introduced me to a friend of his whom we hit off right away. I have to say, when the folks in Israel talk about equality, they mean equality. She laughs at the Singaporean girls who say that females shouldn't need to serve National Service. She refuses to be stuck in a rat race and chooses to spend her limited time in her 30s taking care of her ailing parents. She is refreshing, unlike any girl whom I've met before in Singapore. I was smitten. The months flew by, and before I knew it, I had already made plans to join her there. I have gotten a job offer and I will be flying towards Israel tonight.
I will be moving there to pursue a new way of life, a new job and hopefully a new place to stay until my old age. I will miss the small things in Singapore- the efficient MRT, my favourite Saizeriya (yes, maybe this is the reason I was dumped hahaha), the top quality Roti Coin at Kembangan MRT. But I think that this Chapter of my life in Singapore is at an end. I look forward to my new life in a new place!!

60372,106655,"Don't mind my long story, but this is for all the current NUS students who feel overwhelmed and feel like dropping out.
My name is Mei Ling and I am a 22-year-old Chinese female studying medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My journey to becoming a doctor started when I was just a little girl, watching my grandmother struggle with a chronic illness. I was struck by the power of medicine and the difference that doctors could make in people's lives. I knew then and there that I wanted to become a doctor, to help others the way that my grandmother's doctors had helped her.
Growing up, I was a top student, constantly striving for excellence in everything I did. I was driven, ambitious, and passionate. So, when it was time to choose a career, medicine was the natural choice for me. I was determined to become a doctor and make a difference in the world.
But the journey to becoming a doctor has been far from easy. The Singapore education system is known for its high standards and intense pressure, but in the field of medicine, it's even more grueling. Every day feels like a race against time, with endless hours of studying, assignments, and exams. The competition is fierce, and the expectations are sky-high.
I used to love going to university, soaking up knowledge and expanding my horizons. But now, the thought of stepping foot on campus fills me with dread. I often find myself lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and wondering why I am even there. The constant pressure to succeed has taken a toll on my mental health, and I feel like I am drowning in stress and exhaustion.
The constant comparisons to my peers only add to my stress. It seems like everyone around me is thriving, while I am just struggling to keep up. I have lost my sense of identity and my confidence has taken a hit. I used to be so sure of my path, but now I question everything. I often wonder if I am even cut out for this field, and if I will ever be able to meet the expectations placed upon me.
I have considered dropping out of NUS countless times. The thought of not having to worry about grades and expectations is incredibly tempting. However, I know that quitting is not the solution. I fear that it will only add to my feelings of failure and regret. I fear that I will look back on this time and regret not pushing through, not fighting for my dreams.
Despite my struggles, I am determined to find a way to overcome this burnout. I know that my passion for medicine and my drive to make a difference are still there, buried under the stress and exhaustion. I am searching for ways to rediscover my love for learning and regain my sense of purpose.
I have started seeking support from my professors and peers. I have also taken up mindfulness practices, such as meditation and yoga, to help manage my stress. I have realized the importance of self-care and have started setting aside time for myself to recharge and do things that bring me joy. Whether it's reading a good book, taking a walk in the park, or spending time with friends and family, I have learned to prioritize my well-being and prioritize myself.
I am slowly but surely making progress. I am beginning to rediscover my love for medicine and the reasons why I chose this path. I am regaining my confidence and finding my voice. The journey will not be easy, but I am determined to overcome this burnout and come out stronger on the other side.
I refuse to let the expectations of others define me and dictate my future. I am ready to take control of my life and forge my own path in the field of medicine. I am determined to become a doctor and make a difference in the world, on my own terms.
So if I am trying, you all can too!

60413,106739,"Sayonara Singapore.
I came to Singapore 15 years ago, thinking of making Singapore my home, as it came on top choices compared to other countries, such as US, Australia and Canada. I have studied here and meet my wife here and had my baby here, however Singapore had a different plan. I am a PR for more than 10 years and they are not ready to give my wife a PR even though she has studied here and been here almost same time as me and they rejected application my wife's and my child's PR. So HDB is out of choice. We both make a combined income of 10k+ but more and more money is squeezed out of us. Looks like Singapore Values free money from China and Hong Kong than integrating locally trained people.
At present our house house hold expenditure is more than 80% of our income and our life style is just average, so you can earn and have a decent life in Singapore. But we feel we are just Surviving here and not really living. We are not evening talking about luxury here like car, condo etc. Just a basic life. And it's same for my Singapore friends but slightly better because of HDB. In general, Singapore is becoming a advanced society with surviving people.
What I see from Govt plan is either you are super rich or under 3k family income rest all will just be rich on paper but poor in real life. All my class mates (locals) have already left Singapore and I didn't listen to their advice to pack up 10 years ago. Now, I am Surviving. When I tell about these things , most locals will complain you can go back where you came from, but if we keep having such mentalities Singapore will become next Japan.
Right now, govt is happy to collect millions from foreigners ABSB and giving $300 CDC vouchers to keeps locals mouth shut. So, till govt doesn't prioritise welfare of people, Sg will be millionaires zombie land.

60456,106812,"To #106787 and those who got their A-level results recently: I agree with Prof Leong. I chose what I loved and studied math. It wasn't even my strongest subject. But it made me more money than the 99.999th percentile of software engineers and I now have enough to lounge around, write these long rants for the rest of my life, and gloat.
I didn't collect my A-levels cert on results day, so I found out my grades a week later. Just didn't like queuing and comparing grades. I was already admitted to the school I wanted, and the admission criteria for physics and math at NUS/NTU were low enough I knew I had my backstops. Turns out I was far from a perfect A-level score.
Admissions advice (somewhat CS-specific):
1. There’s wisdom in ignoring the current market outlook for choosing your career path. The market is extremely efficient, so if a particular major pays well now, you can be assured that it will be competitive and commoditized 4-6 years from now, arbitraging away whatever easy upside you get from picking that major.
2. This negative autocorrelation is already evident now with the tech layoffs - I know many in PE, PWM, consulting, marketing, sales, real estate, design etc. roles who’ve made more than their CS counterparts, with less effort.
3. There’s no free lunch. If it were really that easy to predict which sector would outperform others, you’d make even more money just leveraging your education funds in the stock market than studying in that field. Hypothetically, if you really would’ve had such a positive outlook on tech jobs 10 years ago, you’d have been richer just going all-in on FAANG stocks back then than getting a CS degree. And if you still feel your friends in CS really have better job prospects than you, it's never late to just buy into a tech sector ETF.
4. You don’t need a CS degree to be a practitioner. Incidentally, most of the best software engineers I’ve worked with have other STEM degrees or even no degree. 7th employee at Citadel - physics PhD, code still runs today, and he has more money than Jeff Dean.
5. Point 4 and ""do what you love"" translates into something I train all of my hiring managers to look out for. Which is that a software engineer who did in applied math at a top 30 school is most often stronger than a software engineer who did Course 6 at MIT.
6. Most global optimization problems are intractable, and only some highly-constrained optimization problems are easy. Applying this principle: it's bad to be ""interested in tech"". (I wrote #104647 on this.) Find a narrower interest than that. Even “interested in frontend” is not enough. There’s flavors of frontend: do you like frontend tooling and build, or frontend visual design, or building product flows, or maintaining component libraries? The sooner you can apply constraints in your career, the easier your (wealth) optimization problem. It’s hard to get rich by becoming among the top 100 frontend engineers in the world; it’s easier to get rich by becoming among the top 100 component library guys in the world.
7. I’ve seen many people falsely equivocate “Do what you love"" with being lazy. Truly doing what you love takes more hard work, grit, and determination than working for straight A’s to get into CS, law, or whatever course du jour. Traveling the world is not doing what you love. Writing a book; decorating homes; taking selfies; singing aren't. Doing what you love means getting so good at what you're passionate in that you've become one of the best in the world at it. It happens that I know people doing each of the above who've made 1-2 orders of magnitude more than the average L6 software engineer at Google. My best friend made more money modeling in her 20s than any L7 SWE I know, because she's good at it.
8. Taking a scholarship makes it hard for you to choose what you love. So be cautious. (And please don't be the guy with rich parents who breaks his bond after getting to Oxford, because you're depriving someone else.)
9. Pursuing what you love has ancillary benefits. Chiefly, it makes it easier to make quality friends in your adult life. It's nearly as hard making friends when I had $100 as when I had $100M.
I had lunch with the late Martin Trust shortly before he passed. If you have any clothes from H&M or Uniqlo made in Sri Lanka or Vietnam, you owe it to him. He said one thing that day that stuck with me today, ""I made my wealth selling underwear, so nothing's beneath me."" The man's short, but he stood tall. I heard he was surrounded with family and friends at the end.
Do what you love, and whatever you choose, don't fret if it's beneath your station. Because you'll have so many more ways to find happiness if you do.

To the lady who wants to break up with her bf.
My parents are in a similar situation. My father have big dreams of doing start ups and creating businesses but all of his ideas have failed. My mother was the one supporting the family and pouring money into his ventures. Watching my mother worry about finances and putting food on the table, on top of taking care of him, me and my sibling, had made me start to resent my father for being a useless dreamer. He doesn't even do anything at home. Typical MCP and expects us to serve him when he's around just because he's a man. He's not a man in my eyes. My mother is a superhero because she stepped up and became the breadwinner instead. She did everything that he didn't do for the family.
His ego wouldn't let him accept that he's not cut out to be a boss of anything so he would always boast of all the ideas that he have. He has worked part time or temp jobs on an irregular basis because my mother has grown frustrated taking care of this man child. The least he could do is earn his own pocket money. Both my parents grew bitter and my dad moved to some woman's house. I know he cheated on my mum too. They finally got a divorce. I'm so happy for my mom to be free of him.
When I've started working, my dad tried to make me invest in his businesses. I expected him to flop so I only gave him what I can afford to sign off else he would be bothering my mother or my sister instead. Whatever little he made or ever earned he would splurge it on himself. In my eyes, he's just a sperm donor.
I'm not saying your bf will turn out to be just like my dad. Without respect, it's hard to love. Having children under these kind of circumstances would be cruel to everyone.
Your bf may or may not succeed later in life. It does not matter anymore as you are suffering already. The truth is the both of you are no longer compatible. But things did not go so bad all this while so there was no reason to think of breaking up until you realised he wanted to make you his legal wife.
Ignore all those who bash you as they are not living your life. He's not your responsibility to take care for life! Being single is better than being with someone you no longer respect. Be free from him! I support you.

A boyfriend who accompanies you ups and downs. However, as a ladies man, he was talking to other girls too. I was unable to accept it and the relationship fell apart.
Currently, I am in a loving relationship with my fiance. He is everything I wanted, smart, caring, generous and kind. Most importantly, treats you well, protects you and encourages you.

I saw many old pics of sg during that period but couldn't tell how life was life was back then as an average singaporean. Most of what I heard were from my parents and older relatives.
Cost of living was lower but so were salaries. Many in the workforce did not even have a diploma. Stuff like vacations and domestic helpers were luxuries. Mcdonalds and KFC meals were special treats.
Most flats were smaller and some families had 6-7 ppl cramping in a 2/3 room flat.
Taking photos were a big thing and videos were almost non-existent. Even so, most families dont own a camera. Unlike now where you can take hundreds of photos and videos on a single outing.
No netflix and youtube so you had to accept wtv was fed to you on tv.
No internet and mobile phones. School projects meant days and weeks of digging books in the library. No google and online reviews so finding a product or service was based on hearsay and referrals. No whatsapp and video calls so if you had someone who lived overseas, that once a week phone call was the only way of connecting with him. Buying stuff overseas was next to impossible unless you or someone flies there.

60392,106699,"How can I reject my boyfriend's marriage proposal in the least hurtful way possible? I (25F) and my boyfriend K (26M) have known each other since JC and have dated for 4 years. He has always been good to me, treats me well, and I have no doubt that he loves me very much. Recently, I heard from a friend that he has been shopping around for engagement rings and planning for a surprise proposal. Although this should have been happy news for most girls, I actually felt worried, sad and confused instead.
The truth is, deep down inside I fear that I may have already fallen out of love with K. All my life I have been an (almost) straight As student and usually scored in the top 10-20% of the cohort. I am quite ambitious and competitive in my outlook, and some might even call me an overachiever. Since graduation, I have secured a pretty cushy job that pays close to 5 digits with high hopes for my future career progression.
K is quite the opposite academically. Back in school he was a bit of a joker and would rather spend his days hanging out with friends than revising. Although he was in a good school, his grades consistently scraped the bottom of the barrel and he said he ""just wasn't cut out for studying"". Despite this, K actually has very lofty goals and holds himself to (his own) high standards. He has always talked about his dreams of making it big as an entrepreneur and to be his own boss by the age of 30.
Although I desperately want to be supportive of his dreams, honestly I find many of his business ideas naive, ill-conceived and financially unfeasible. I tried my best to rescue several of his past ""big ideas"" by helping him research business regulations, liaise with industry partners etc. Yet, all of them turned a massive flop because they were fundamentally flawed to begin with. As he fast approaches 30, I think reality is sinking in that he is unlikely to reach his goal and will be stuck in his 3k/month admin job forever. In the past year or so, he has been showing signs of depression such as chronic oversleeping and self-destructive thoughts which has further sucked him into a downward spiral. I suspect that his pride is also wounded by the ever-widening gap between our life trajectories as he would refuse to come to company D&Ds with me as my +1.
I feel that my love for K has been slowly whittled down by the endless cycle of his doomed entrepreneurial ventures. I am exhausted from juggling multiple hats as girlfriend, therapist and business consultant. At the risk of sounding materialistic, I also find it hard to see a future with him buying a house and raising kids with equal financial contributions as I will probably end up paying for the bulk of it while also trying to protect his pride. With that being said, I will always care deeply for K given all the happy times we have shared together and everything he has done for me. He is a good and kind man who truly loves me with all of his heart, and I don't want to crush him completely especially given the current rut he is in. How can I let him down as gently as possible about his plans for a proposal, and would it be cruel for me to ask for a break/ a break up now?

You chose to come to Singapore, you chose to accept the Uni grants in exchange for a bond. The bond never promised you that getting a job here is 100% certain. Nobody forced you to accept the terms that if you fail to get a job to work here for some years, you have to pay the bond damages. You chose your current circumstances, enjoyed the benefits of a world class education for a cheap cost and thus have to face the consequences.
In almost every country, governments usually have a ""locals first"" policy. This is expected as the government's duty is to their own citizens first. We are born here, we pay taxes here, promise to defend this country and most stay and live to the day we pass away. Will you do the same for Singapore? Perhaps you can apply for PR and join the SAFVC for a start.
You at least have the backup option to ""pack my bags and return home"" when things are bad, where do you think native Singaporeans can go? Do you think it's easier for most native Singaporeans to pack our bags to go to your native country to find work? What will you think if companies in your native country say ""Job should be given based on ability not nationality."" and thus you or your country people are denied jobs.
The world is almost 8 billion, SG is only 5.5 million. For every Singaporean, there is 1500 ppl out there. Thus there is always a better more qualified candidate in the world who can accept lower wages. If it was free for all, most Singaporeans will not be hired. Especially since we must ask for higher wages due to high cost of living and reservist obligations for men.
It's not true that you did not get your foot in the door. MOE gave you that bond so can study here and find a job. That is your foot in the door. How many other governments do you think are as generous?

Just here to vent and not to get a solution. I mean, Chatgpt has read all the books in the world about how to be a better and more likeable human.

Gg to grad soon, and my mum is like faster go find job, any job just take. I recently declined a super lowball 2.5k job, and she has been nagging at me ever since, totally regret telling her.
Her perspective is like, lowball or what, she doesnt unds, hv money go work, people looking for jobs shld get any job they can. Then I ask her, so you want me to be depressed and low pay? Then my mum said, still got pay what, how difficult can the work be, isn't it just typing (tech job btw), dont think too much wont be depressed, interview say OT and weekend work just scaring ppl, wont happen one. She has only worked pt jobs w low qualifications so she dont unds me, like at all. And she die die dont believe me when I said OT work no extra pay, she kept insisting that OT work is good cos got extra money.
Everyday is like this. ""Pay ok what, any pay just say yes la, there is no pay that is low, the companies know what to pay you, dont big mouth. Work tiring meh? Sit down get fat only, move fingers. Unhappy resign also ok what, got money"". Wha she so money minded I really cannot tahan. Everything is money money money, not like we living in rental flat or damn poor.
Ok I really dont unds her and it's not like I'm shaking my legs at home or not paying my part of the bills, she keeps nagging me to find any job, like literally 2k also ok range to her. How to get through to her idk. Other parents hv high expectations of their kids, then there's mine, 2.5k is very good for a degree holder, on the other extreme end.

60401,106715,"Valentine’s day is here and for those that are bummed out about being single, I’m here as a happily attached person to tell you, it’s not worth it being too sad about this.
I know of a couple who just celebrated their first anniversary this month and the bf is actively hiding impt problematic shit from his gf. She has no clue about this because he’s a very experienced liar that knows how to play the sunk cost fallacy game. She also doesn’t know how little she’s getting out of a partner (in terms of interest and effort; I’m not talking about money btw) just bcos he is less attracted to her physically, compared to his ex.
Just because you see people’s romantic couple stuff online, doesn’t mean that their relationship is an enviable one to be in. We are all flawed people finding a way to get what we want in this world. The reality is that even if you’re a mature person that trusts your partner, it doesn’t mean they won’t take advantage of you. You could very well be taken on a ride by a person who knows how to play the relationship game well. Your maturity might be exploited because you are healthy enough not to overthink/second guess your partner.
So love yourself a little more, and don’t beat yourself up if you are single. Regardless of your gender, trust your gut and don’t despair just cos you haven’t found “the one”. Aiming for perfection is unrealistic but that doesn’t mean you should settle for anything less than you deserve. It’s also important to pay attention to what’s not being said instead of letting someone’s sweet talk/behaviour deceive you from seeing what type of person he/she actually is. The last thing you wanna be, is taken for a fool in a relationship that you are going to be giving so much to.

I can't get away from the guilt and pain from the loss. Coming from a single parent family, my mom had worked her whole life bringing my brother and me up. Now at her old age, my mom is still working and did not even have $20k in her savings, and yet, i squandered away $50k just like that.

60425,106760,"Is it wrong to be rich?
I come from a middle class family, parents raised me up, put me through university, and now I’m out in the working world making a living for myself in corporate. Like many others, I share the Singaporean dream of climbing the corporate ladder and possibly striking the jackpot in Singapore pools.
As a sandwiched class of society, I have been observing people from different financial and socioeconomic backgrounds. I have friends who are less fortunate in life, with terminally ill parents and young siblings to support. I also have friends who are wealthy and comfortable, with wonderful parents helping them with their housing down payment and buying them a car upon graduation.
I too, like many others, aspire to be wealthy and provide a comfortable life for my kids in future. Which is why I understand why many parents from wealthy families “spoil” their children, because no parent will want to see their child struggle in life. As such, many outsiders will give comments such as “spoilt brat from rich family” or “privileged and silver spoon”.
Some of this children from wealthy families do actually appreciate their generational wealth and are humble. Some, not so much, and will splurge their parents money irresponsibly. But regardless of weather that wealthy child is humble, or one who is irresponsible, they will still be subjected to such labels.
I always see negative comments in Facebook and instagram posts, when it comes to wealthy people. Take for example the recent spotlight on dick Lee’s family putting their bungalow up for sale and donating 60 million to charity. Many, actually most, of the comments are saying that they are trying to evade taxes through their charitable deeds or just looking to be in the limelight and doing it for fame.
Another example is the case of Naomi Neo, a local influencer in Singapore. Whenever she splurge on her children, for example on the birthday for her daughter, people were just so toxic and negative in the comments.
Now bringing me back to the question, is it wrong to be rich? Because if being rich subjects me to such hate, it seems like a curse.
But it’s a curse that I will want to suffer, in silence.

60436,106787,"Prof Ben just wrote a post on the good pay of CS grads yet at the same time not choose a course based on existing market conditions. Choose something we love to do blah blah..
I find his statements extremely disingenuous. Prof Ben seems stuck in his ivory tower with the good pay and iron rice bowl as an NUS Prof. I glanced at his resume, he has not worked much in the private sector if at all to be qualified to be making such statements.
Inflation is high, housing and rental prices are through the roof just to name a few. As much as we want to do what we like, wages have not kept up much in real terms for a long time. It is the most rational choice for young people to take a course that offers the best ROI.
Interest may be good, but putting food on the table and saving for a roof over your head is still a priority. Having more money gives you options to pursue whatever interest you may like.
CS is one of the few courses that has bucked this salary trend. High pay, work from home, good hours compared to jobs of similar tier like law or medicine. If you qualify for law or medicine but don't like them, take a CS degree. Plenty of people yearn to have a CS degree but do not qualify, you will be a fool for throwing that option away. If you have a CS degree but not working in software raking in big money, you are a fool too. If it is possible, give me your CS degree.
Only a minority of students can qualify for CS since the cutoff is a perfect A-level score. The people he is preaching to are the cream of the crop. What if my interest is in tech but just happens that I did not score a perfect result.
I did not have the luxury of having perfect A-level scores to enter CS so have to settle for an engineering major instead. Best I can try for is minor in CS and hopefully that is sufficient to get an IT job. Sucks to be born 10 years late if not I could have entered CS more easily.

60443,106781,"Good evening everyone
There’s something that I want to seek opinion on from you guys and it took me a long time to feel comfortable opening up to you guys online. So I am gonna start sharing it now.
My husband and I have been together for more than a decade. We are both individuals that really enjoy sex and we have it often 3-4 times a week. We have no intentions of having kids as we enjoy the financial freedom and time freedom of traveling where ever and whenever we want.
It was only recently that we realized that we are starting to age a bit. For example, being more prone to injuries as we both led a very active lifestyle with sports such as swimming, running, and hiking. We often have the common understanding that we should always cherish our time together with one another as time waits for no man.
Just a few days ago, I had lunch with a couple of my close friends that are slightly older than me. They all mentioned that they either stopped having intercourse or either did it once a year. I shared this with my husband and he was as shocked as I was.
As mentioned earlier, we both enjoyed the idea of cherishing our time together. Thus, I have suggested to my husband that maybe we could do a nude couple photo shoot together or maybe a sex tape together. (Pls do not judge) He agreed to the idea and our rationale was that because we both really enjoy sex and we only live once. We both want to keep a memory of something with both enjoy doing together regardless if it’s a photo or video. I mean it will not be long before our skin becomes wrinkly and our hair turns grey.
So I am curious what are some opinions you guys have and where I can do them professionally

We met each other through socmed few years back, we met quite frequent and along the way, our feelings flourished, he made a first move on courting me thus we decided to be together after.
We tried so hard to keep secret on our r/s, that none of our friends knew about it. And yes, we managed to keep it under wrap up until now. Perhaps both of us are introverted type and we didn’t share much on our personal life in socmed. Along the years of our endearment, we never had a big quarrel, we respect at each other like a matured adult eventhough we are young. But people did said that having no quarrels in r/s a big redflag, but here we are, we still together at that time. We even met almost on weekly basis and sometimes stay-over at his place.
Up until last year, he texted me and suddenly he urgently wanted to have a long conversation with me and discuss over our r/s. At that moment, I know it won’t end up well. But surprisingly it was one of the most serene discussion that I have ever had in my life. He started the conversation with something that triggered my thoughts, “before i discuss about it with you, i need to deeply say sorry to you”. To conclude everything, he wanted to tell me that he wanted to settle down and have a proper relationship with any girl that he will meet in future. Yes, he is a guy whom ended up with courting me, which is also a guy.
I tried so hard to process what he was trying to say to me. But in the end, I didn’t feel any anguish, not even a disappointment or sad. As someone whom trying to understand his point of view, I guessed that he made a right decision for himself in a long run and as from my side, I need to respect his decision and let him go eventhough I am on the losing side. Before we parted away, we apologized at each other for any big mistakes we did along our r/s, in which I didn’t recall any. As for my final request to him, I deleted my number, texts and pictures on his phone and he deleted on mine as a sign of parting. “I wish you well” was his last words before we went on our ways. After I went back home, I just realized that some of his belongings and gifts are still here. And that is when it hits me hard, I cried so hard.
It has been a month plus since both of us parted away from each other. Few days back, we were supposed to celebrate our 1200th day but here I am, tried to forget everything and move on.

60364,106638,"Replying to #106581: https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/106581
I've hired hundreds of engineers and had many years of success hiring away from Citadel, Google, Facebook, Stripe, Jump, Jane Street, to name a few.
I disagree with #106571 here. I feel the last 3 months have been the best hiring market for startups in the past ten years.
And the pay also remains amazing for employees. (Not to mention, it's especially stupid to be picky on jobs when you're fresh out of college. At this stage, investing in yourself, and acquiring work skills, has a faster ROI than any other way to gain income.) In my day, my classmates who were IMO medalists and had internships at KCG/Uber/Google would at best get US$150k out of college. Today, the same would land US$500k out of college, far better than pre-2020 after demeaning average wage growth across other industries and adjusting for inflation.
As for startup hiring advice, I don't recommend combing layoff lists. Never had success with one. Large companies are extremely good at trimming operational excess. And they know their employees better than you. So you'll experience a lot of adverse selection even if you got a reply.
Roughly in descending order, here's 7 things that I find are most effective in improving your hiring chances:
1. Press coverage.
2. Fundraising momentum, e.g. big name VC.
3. High throughput.
4. ""Glamor"" posts about the job on your company social media.
5. A nice website or product.
6. Other teammates with good pedigree.
7. Open source.
8. On-campus talks.
You can't immediately control (2). (5) is a chicken-and-egg problem, since you need good hires to build a good product. (8) is difficult outside of the US.
For (1), it's hard to get media interest in your product and expensive to pay a PR company to astroturf on your behalf. We've found a cheap strategy is to do press releases, e.g. joint press releases with your partners or vendors. You get picked up by a few large journals, your company's CB rank goes up, you get spotted by others who trawl for new companies, including VCs and journalists; this creates a ladder of better press coverage over time. As a side benefit, it boosts your SEO.
Regarding (3), if you're finding it hard to hire, it often means you need even more throughput. More sourcing; more job posts; more interviews; faster pipeline etc. A well-organized ATS helps (I like Greenhouse, but Lever is OK too). Even during seed stage, we had about >10^4 applicants per year, made offers to <0.3% of them, and had an offer acceptance rate over 85%. I had it harder at my first startup: our 2nd and 3rd hires took 50+ and 300+ interviews respectively. My cofounders and I took all of those calls in the span of 2 months.
If your offer acceptance rate is too low, it's a signal that you should pay more. It's even more expensive to have your hiring team's time to be interviewing candidates for nothing gained.
Regarding (4), it's easy to copy others who're good at this. Market making firms are extremely good at doing this, even better than MANGA firms, because they are more dependent on talent than quantity. I say HRT is the golden standard for this. (Don't be mistaken — on the surface, Stripe has a more successful social media strategy and more subscribers, but they're mostly targeting their customers, whereas HRT's audience is almost 100% their candidate pool.)
(6) is trivially obvious, but I'm surprised so many companies don't care. There's a positive feedback loop when you hire people from top firms and universities: it attracts others. It's worth halving your target headcount just to afford these.
Regarding (7), I always make it an effort to email authors and maintainers for work that I appreciate, and offer to buy them coffee if they ever drop by my city. You'll be surprised how many US$750k+ comp engineers will reciprocate interest in your work. Besides this, several of my teammates and I have contributed to the high visibility projects — Linux kernel, LLVM, Cmake, Rust, Intel DAOS, Ceph, Cumulus etc. — which I find helps with recruiting.
(6) and (7) work in tandem. Good candidates do homework on their interviewer. It's important that you have a few interviewers who are there to impress the candidates early on in the interview pipeline. You get a good read when a candidate is star-struck by their interviewer and speaks with a deferential tone. If you don't feel that way, it means you need to improve your interviewers' own public image.

I have not received many replies from many companies. At least some have the courtesy to tell me I've been rejected. I decided to ask one HR why and she bluntly told me it's because I'm not a Singaporean. There is a govt quota in place and thus have to prioritise the hiring of Singaporeans. Even drastically lowering my salary expectations has not helped.
I'm extremely demoralised and fearful. I need to serve a bond after I graduate but it seems I'm not given the opportunity to do so. Job should be given based on ability not nationality. At least let me get the foot in the door to prove my worth. All the talk that Singapore is a welcoming cosmopolitan city with opportunities seems to be a lie.
What should I do? I fear I will just have to pack my bags and return home after I graduate.

However, as we start to get comfortable with each other, he stopped doing that. I still continue to do that for myself though. I did hint for him to start hitting the gym (and even offered to go together with him), as well as buying beauty products so he can groom himself better.
Another thing is people around me constantly remind me that he is not good looking. And that hurts me as well, because I don't like it when people say such things about my boyfriend. But I'm trying my best to help him doll up as well. He doesn't seem to appreciate it though, he sees it as me not loving him as he is. I do love him, I just wish for him to be more presentable, especially when he goes out to work, looking smart gives him a better impression. Am I wrong for doing so?

I am facing some issues as an NS GF and would like to get some advice from the public, especially from people of NUSWhispers since I have seen several NS stories on this platform. During the past 1 year, my BF has barely initiated calling me while he was in the army and I had eventually grown tired of always initiating it. His reasons were always that he was tired, busy, or whatever it could be, but I could catch him sometimes online on gaming platforms. I understand that calling everyday could be very uneventful or dreading for him as I feel that he has nothing to talk to me about, but I hope that he’d at least try to call me once a week if he wasn’t so tired. I asked some of my NS GF gals in one of my module and they told me that they often have conversations at night with their boyfriend, event if it was just for 5 minutes. My BF would also share his army stories with me when he books out and occasionally tells me stories through text if it was interesting enough for him to rush to share the story. However, despite appreciating that he is willing to share his stories with me, he always utilise army slangs despite me having already told him probably more than 10 times that I hoped he could use simpler terms because I am not familiar with the slangs that he was using with me. As a result, I find myself constantly searching online for the slangs and even asking my guy friends in class about the meaning behind those slangs that he was using as he does not try to explain to me what the slang means. For a real life example, the slang “turn out”, when questioned, would be explained by him as “basically like just turning out lo”… I really hope people of this page could give me advice on what I should do with this situation and how I can better improve this tragic barrier between us.

60446,106789,"After reading #106752, I'm deeply troubled by the hint of xenophobia inside. The supportive comments below that post and number of likes makes me wonder if Singapore is actually a welcoming place to foreigners.
A short introduction about me. I'm a year 3 EE student. I'm from another Asian nation, took the tuition grant too and have to work in Singapore after graduation.
I'm deeply grateful to the Singapore government for offering me this opportunity. My home country does not have good universities and it has been my dream to study abroad in a good university especially one as good as NUS. I remembered being extremely overjoyed when I was accepted to NUS with this grant as my family would not have afforded to pay the full fees otherwise.
I still have some time before graduation but I can understand the stress that the OP in #106746 is facing. For #106752 to put him/her down with such strong words is totally uncalled for as you Singaporeans may not grasp how much it took for us to get here.
Singaporeans have it relatively easy to enter NUS. For outsiders like me, we have to top our high schools, brush up our English to get good scores for IELTS or TOEFL to even have a remote chance of getting in. After we get offered, it's a big change for us to move to a foreign land, study a degree that is not our first language with no family support.
With this additional stress for us to find a job after we graduate if not we have to fork out huge damages, in a job market that is stacked against us, I can understand OP is frustrated and fearful. We should be more emphatatic.
The minimum we ask for is a fair chance to consider us. We are people seeking a better life just like you. If SGP government didn't think we can add value to the Singapore economy, we would not have been offered the TFG.

60360,106629,"Sorry for the long story but any advice would really help me.
I am a student at NUS, studying computer science. My parents got divorced when I was in high school and it was a tough time for me. They fought a lot, and at times, it would turn violent. I always felt scared and trapped in the middle of their arguments.
Growing up, my family struggled with low-income jobs and I couldn't afford tuition. It was hard for me to focus on my studies and I often felt overwhelmed. To make things worse, I had toxic friends who constantly bullied me for not having both parents. They would call me names and make fun of my family situation.
I started to feel the weight of their words and eventually developed depression and anxiety. I sought help from my school counselor, but it was not enough. I needed more support, but my parents were unable to provide it. I had to separate myself from my friend group, but in doing so, I found myself alone and isolated.
The thought of ending it all crossed my mind many times, but I pushed through, trying to find solace in my studies and hobbies. I had two boyfriends, but both relationships were short-lived. The first one played me and the second one had to end because his parents didn't approve.
Now, I feel like I have no one to turn to. I am alone, with no friends, no relationship, and no parents to support me. It takes a toll on me emotionally, but I try to focus on my future and my studies. I know that I have the potential to do great things and make a better life for myself, but it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when I feel so lost and alone.
What should I do now? I'm so lost honestly.

Been working three years in ""Singapore's Best Local Bank"" in the Tech department and what a burn-out its been.
Culture is terrible. Bullying is rife.
Over-sight by upper management on these human-management problems is non.
Tech department is broken into little fiefdoms where how things run are based entirely on the temperament of whoever can bully others better. Top-down, many things are often not properly prioritized to be done somewhere leading to sudden and random bouts of frantic work done late into the night or on weekends.
The official turn-over rate of the bank is 15-18%, but that number must be evened out by other departments because in Tech roles the number of voluntary leavers I've seen these part three years are closer to 30%.
What I want to ask is; is the grass always greener the other side? Or am I being fragile about this? Should I leave to find greener pastures? or stay because its like this everywhere and it'll get better?
I see my classmates in other places who have a much healthier relationship with their workplace, having a very balanced life outside of work.
But maybe it just seems that way, and they are also quietly battling these tech industry human-mismanagement.

- hired a temp to do paperwork for him and that temp was said to be his friend.
- hired a technologist for the lab. the technologist was from the school (or class?) he taught, looking very fresh but i am not sure whose idea it was to state 6 years of experience in her resume.
- hired a number of interns presumably from his ex-institution.
- Allowed an intern to end internship early without letting HR know. HR was shocked to learn this after the intern left.
- Sat together with his own clique of temp and interns almost zero interaction with the rest of the company.
- Having zoom lessons in the midst of work. (He is part time lecturer now.) Might have been pre-arranged with company but all the above look like he is not fully committed to the company ?

Please help me, as I genuinely have nobody reliable to ask and I don't dare to ask you in person... Maybe there are others out there who are struggling with this too and your response will also guide them??
1. Based on your understanding of the professors in your faculty, is there a way of asking for recommendation letters that increases the chances of them saying yes to me? Google tells me that I should send personal details like what I have done under them, my CV, even statements of purpose, etc, in the first email where I ask them if they would be comfortable writing me a strong recommendation letter. But that sounds like I am bombarding them info - am I wrong to think so? Would it be okay to send a short, 1st email to ask about their willingness and then another exchange a few months later to give them personal details when I have updated my CV with achievements that are currently upcoming but will become official by then, like conference presentations and journal publications?
2. Are there different yardsticks for what goes in the recommendation letter, when one applies to Masters programs vs PhD programs? Would I look bad if I tell my professors I would like to apply for both Masters and PhD, in case my PhD applications don't go through? How many schools/programs can I trouble a professor to send their letter to without them feeling like I am just shooting applications at admissions committees blindly? Is 8 or 10 too many, Masters and PhD programs combined?
Thank you profs very much!!!
