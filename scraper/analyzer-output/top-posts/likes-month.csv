The guy who earns less than 4k a month.
I don't know you. But I've met men like you. I totally get why you made such sweeping statements about women. No one likes to be rejected. I can tell you one thing. Even men who make less than 4k a month can get women. But would you reject the women who want you? You probably won't even give these kind of women a second look as you deem them as not good enough for you. It's like you're a 5/10, wanting an 8/10 and looking down at any woman who is 4 to 6.
Everyone wants the best for themselves but what do you have that the 'best' must accept you?
I'm guessing from your post, not only you do not have money, you also don't have the looks, personality or intelligence to nab the type of women you're after. So what does that leave you? Focus on what you can work on. Calling women gold diggers because you are rejected just shows you haven't learnt much about women.
If a man have enough good points but don't make enough money, some women will be willing to stay around and work together with you. Trust me, you wouldn't want a woman who will be with you just because you can earn 20k a month. Just like all people who want to have a relationship, we want someone who is willing to be with us through thick and thin.
The only advantage you have is that men have almost no expiry date compared to women. You can be 40 and still date women from 20s to 40s while a woman of the same age have to settle for a smaller pool.
But above all, I still have faith that men like you would be able to find someone one day. She may not be your first choice, she may not be a perfect 10, but I can assure you, as long as you play your part as a decent person, lover, boyfriend or husband in this partnership and help each other blossom, she can become a perfect 10 in your eyes.

60603,107106,"I have been reading stories about toxic parents, and parents who demand too much allowance. So I'm here to share my story. Just want to get this out of my chest.
Mother was divorced shortly after I was born. She then cohabited with a gambler who frequently molested my elder sister and me. We told her a few times that we were being molested, but the most she did was to tell the gambler that he must be careful in the way he touched us so that we won't call it molest. Had to live in fear everyday for more than 10 years until they spilt. Then she got together with another guy and they got married, so legally he is my stepfather. But I am totally not close to him.
My relationship with my mother wasn't good to begin with. Since young, I blamed her for not protecting me when I was molested for so many times. She was also very biased. She treated my sister much better than me. My elder sister always had new clothes and toys whereas I could only have hand-me-downs. I had to put up with her daily insults and she laid her hands on me even when I was in JC. She never scolded my sister before, no matter what my sister did. I had to do housework while my sister could slack at home the whole day. I could go on and on about the disparity in treatment.
Her attitude towards me slightly improved when I entered the workforce because I started to give her allowance. At first, I thought that I can finally have a loving mother and experience some family warmth. But I was wrong. After I got married and had kids, I told her that I could not give her as much allowance as before. Her attitude changed immediately. When I brought my kids over to visit her, she liked to criticise them just like how she insulted me when I was young. She has never bought any gifts for my kids. I dreaded bringing my kids over to her place because the vibe was always so negative and my kids were puzzled why their grandmother hated them so much. Then one day we had a big argument over money (she obviously wanted more money from me) and I decided that enough is enough. She is just seeing me as a money tree. Given how badly she treated me when I was young and how nasty she was to my kids, I felt that she does not deserve to receive another cent from me and I want to protect my kids from their toxic grandmother. So I cut off all contact with her.
In case you all are wondering whether she is acting this way because she didn't have enough allowance, I can tell you no. She has stopped working for the past 20 years and her monthly allowance from my stepfather, my sister and me was $3000. She is just a housewife who cooks dinner 3 times a week, spends most of her time sleeping at home (or flirting with other men outside, behind my stepfather's back). Yet she is getting $3000, more than the hawker centre cleaners who toil their back from morning till night. And she had the audacity to ask more money from me? It didn't occur to her that she had been mentally and physically abusing me since I was young?
It was that big argument that made me realised that I really hated her to the core all these years. After I cut off contact with her, I dreamt of her occasionally (I never dreamt of her before). And in all my dreams, I was venting my anger on her. I was scolding her all the things I wanted to say to her face in real life. I even slapped her in my dreams. I would wake up feeling angry because the dreams felt so realistic, but also quite satisfied that I 'got my revenge'.
I do feel that I am in a better place now. I don't need such a toxic mother to ruin my life and my kids' lives. I can have my own loving family, with me modeling what a good parent is to my kids.

Me: 22F, active lifestyle, all sorts of hobbies ranging from trading card games to martial arts, lowkey chatterbox, honours year NUS student.
My standards: decent shape, has hobbies and interests he is able to talk about, and is in a position that I'm not likely to be the main breadwinner in the long run. idgaf if he's a poly grad with a side hustle, another student in my faculty, a fresh grad with fresh grad pay, whatever. Have something going on.
I am very very lucky if I can find someone who even hits 2 of those. Went on so many blind dates. One of the better dates was another TCG nerd who I could talk with all night, but wasn't physically attractive for me - alamak, what to do, close two eyes also cannot.
Then got the prettyboys who have interests but cannot talk.
Then got those who cannot present themselves well, but can talk... however, it is only about work.
Then finally got the legend that looked 46 years old at 26, insulted the disabled waiters - in one of those 'manned only by the disabled' cafés - within 5 minutes of sitting down, insulted me within 20 minutes of that, and blamed immigrants for him (poly dropout with no interest in upskilling, no side hustles, and clearly no ability to remove his foot from his mouth) earning $2k/month. WTAF?
Alamak. Men, take comfort that no matter how bad you think you might be, you're probably not stupid enough to insult the disabled waiters during a blind date.
I'm sure most SGean men are not like this, but the sheer amount of nonsense I have to filter through makes me want to give up and start looking into adopting a few cats. I'll be the crazy cat lady with a bottle of wine and a sick card collection that is singlehandedly paying a game store's rent, idgaf.

60560,107015,"Humanity is hopeless
I am a doctor working for the past 15 years at both the hospital and now GP clinic. After I graduated, as much as I want to uphold the oath in serving the sick, I find myself feeling despair for the general public as time goes by. Call me irresponsible but you do not know the effort I put into serving the community selflessly as long as I could. Every encounter with idiots and stupid people slowly chips away the drive and passion I once had to helping people out of their medical problems. Unfortunately they are not rare or uncommon. 30% is the rough estimate percentage of idiots I see daily. The most common type of idiots I see are liars. Other types include self-entitled, demanding, abusive, stubborn and etc. It made me come to a conclusion that this profession is meaningless. I do not see the reason in helping out idiots, I do not think they deserve it. They waste my time that I could have meaningfully spend on genuine patients. Simply search for any hospital or clinics in Google Maps, read the reviews and you will understand the public's attitude. I'm confident that I would not be the only one with this mentality. I give up. Good luck to humanity.

60581,107054,"I have 3 other siblings and we are 2 sets of non identical twins. I come from quite a well to do family (I'm being modest tbh) and dad is an extremely good businessman.
Courtesy of dad's upbringing, my 3 other siblings are also typical high flyers, climb corporate ladder damn fast kinda people. Both dominating in their respective fields. As a result, their earnings are easily the top 1% of our population. We each have a fully paid condo unit under each of our names, which we are all staying in, courtesy of daddy again. I chose a different route and entered the public sector as a brand new doctor with no intentions to enter private healthcare (due to many personal and professional reasons), and I think I can be a very good doctor, serving the public, in the long run.
As a closely knitted family, we go for holidays together all the time. When we were young, daddy paid for us, now we all pay for him. The issue is now.... I don't earn as much as them and cannot afford to travel they way they do. I can't afford to fly first class, >3x a year to stay in a 5 star resort for a week on my doctor's salary! I don't even have enough leave days. For the first few trips, my siblings paid for me, but after a while they sorta hinted that I should pay for myself when it's very clear that I cannot.
Dad gave the ""be nice"" speech and suggested that I plan the next holiday, so we can all go together. I did just that and throughout the whole trip, my siblings were complaining. Complaining that economy class seats are so small and packed, that the 4 star hotel's shower is lousy, service staff is meh. 2 siblings even upgraded their seats halfway the flight because ""why should we sit economy? We worked hard and deserve to be pampered.""
During said trip, dad had to, multiple times, put his foot down and gave the ""be nice"" speech. Once the speech is given, all siblings behaved. But it's very obvious that they were not enjoying the trip but tolerating it.
Back in SG, we also have dinners regularly, and due to my work schedule and the fact that I don't drive, I usually turn up late. Dad will insist to wait for me, much to the displeasure of my other siblings. I dont blame them, sometimes I can be 2 hrs late. Once my sibling just said to me, "" just buy a ******* car, buy a cheap jap one so you can be on time or at least earlier."" I just broke down and shouted ""I cant afford it!"" That siblings was stunned that I can't even afford a Jap car, as if that is extremely foreign to them. I saw my twin muttered (I can lip read and they know) ""Just how much are they paying you?"" My heart broke as I know my twin was not being malicious, but it shows how we now are in 2 different worlds. They were genuinely confused and trying to find out. If I had opened my mouth to ask, they would have bought the car for me, but dad didnt raise us this way.
Dad came to talk to me alone after this, and gave a long speech on how I chose this career path despite knowing what's our family's background. Hence now I have to learn how to handle the siblings or forever not be a part of them. This is the consequence of my actions and he can't be there covering me all the time. Now, I have to deal with my siblings, next time it can be another rich idiot, or another idiot higher rank than me. That's dad's upbringing style. My siblings thrived and become ""fighters"". I have always been the more passive one. haiz......|
Recently, my 3 siblings went overseas without me and I felt a pang of sadness. As if I have been ""kicked out"". For a twin, this is a damn big deal. Talked to dad about it and all he had to say was everyone can make their own decisions, how are we going to react to it is up to us. We are all adults with our own careers, how he also isnt invited. He then turn it around and asked me how I intend to handle this?
Haiz..... I honestly don't know. So to my juniors in med school, dont become a doctor for money. There are a lot of easier ways to earn money without sacrificing ur time, mental health, family and personal relationships.

60540,106981,"my (21m) gf (20f) just broke up with me last thursday, without saying a word. she just ghosted me, blocked me on whatsapp, telegram, and even my phone number when i tried to call her.
we had been together for 9 months. she was my very first gf, while she previously had 2 exes (recent one being 30yo), and 2 fwbs (recent one being 40yo) which came as a shock to me when i found out later, but i just chose to ignore her past.
things were going well for us the first few months, going on fun dates, texting until 4am everyday.. at that time, it really felt like she was a genuinely nice person, who was easy-going and fun to be with.
the 2 of us came from vastly different family backgrounds, with me being more well-off while her having to rent a room to live in with her divorced stepmother.
knowing this, i offered for her to move in with me in my room at my house for 3 months, as it would more conducive for her studies, which my parents agreed to.
the first few weeks of living together was fun, spending time and cuddling together everyday. i gave her all the love she needed, dry her hair, bathe her everyday, and even wash her bra and underwear together with her every week. other than these chores, i even helped her edit her assignments and reports for school.
over time, this became a norm, and she started taking these for granted, getting annoyed when i do not have the time to do those stuffs for her due to my own schoolwork piling up. i had no choice but to sacrifice some work and sleep just to do these for her. but it really felt like there was no appreciation for what i did.
as more weeks went by, more red flags started surfacing. she would complain to me when my parents cooks meal that she doesn't like, or get annoyed at me for not spending enough time with her when i have got assignments to complete, and many other small things which made me see her true self.
but even with all these, i chose to forgive and forget, hoping that she will become a better version of herself one day, hoping that this could really be a long-lasting relationship.
unfortunately, i was wrong. recently, we started to drift apart, texting less, hanging out less. despite all this, i still helped her edit her personal statements in her uni applications, hoping that i can make a difference in her future, or even OUR future.
less than a week after i finished editing her final application for her, she blocked me off completely without a goodbye. i tried to meet her at her home, but she just avoided me completely.
3 days ago, i went to her workplace, hoping for a proper talk to find some closure. i saw her with another guy. she had cheated on me, after all we have been through together for the past 9 months, without even a proper goodbye. that was my last time seeing her.
my first rs was such a shitty one. living together with someone can really help you see their true colours. i regret staying in this rs for so long, even after seeing all the red flags, genuinely hoping that some day she will change.
but i guess, some people never change. some people will never be grateful for what they have, until it's gone.
knowing that i really tried my best in providing everything for her, this breakup has hurt me so much that im not sure whether i would be capable of loving anyone else the same. i dont think i will ever be able to get over this completely. i feel used and thrown away like i meant nothing. whereever i go, our memories together would keep coming back.
what i learnt from this is: LEAVE before you get pulled even further into a hopeless rs. staying longer would just make it even more painful when it eventually ends..

This is because Even when they say want to stay in hdb, they want a big enough hdb and good location enough hdb which once again cost >600k . In addition, They still expect to be wined and dined, and with yearly regional trips and occasional staycations and gifts/flowers etc.

60591,107084,"Contrary to what other young people think, I feel it's fine to give allowance and help with house chores at home as much as possible. Hear me out.
My family is a typical Asian household. Mum left workforce early to take care of us at home. Only Dad works. To me it's logical to support Mum and sometimes Dad because of what they did for us since young. Especially Mum, but sometimes, have to act a bit filial piety. Up the allowance by 10 or 20, even 50 sometimes to show you care. Act a bit. Then in the future if you need to reduce, they won't have much to say, and remember to let them know you up their allowances. Do alrdy need to show. Cos you filial piety before, or did even more, so when it's time to reduce filial piety, they will understand.
Next, housework. Since young, Mum has been the one doing it. Now it's my turn. I do it for a few reasons. First being I don't want to incur medical costs when they injure themselves. Wipe the ceiling fan? Come I do. Mop floor, I do. Wash toilet I do. I'm still young I do. The chances of me injuring myself is way lower than when they do them. When you do for them, you are helping yourself too. Second being you can train to do things yourself to prepare yourself when it's time to live alone. Learn progressively. This week learn mop floor. Next week learn toilet. Following week learn ironing. I know many of us still ask our mothers to iron our clothes. Some don't even know how to use washing machine. Now it's the time to learn. For parents and underneath this, really it's for yourself.
This might sound selfish, but what you are doing is actually to prepare yourself, to master the skills needed. To help yourself. So it's ok to give your parents allowance. It's fine because they might not be working, or they earn little. Show that you care. Because all these will be your arsenals in the future. Reasons to siam things. Take it as opportunity cost. Cost that you should be willing to incur for a better future.

Yes, they are rich, they earn million a year, they sometimes shows their wealth on social media.
I make half a million last year.
I remember my big boss coming to career fair a decade ago. The first thing he said was, don't worry, I am not asking you to be an agent, I am asking you to join my corporate world. He knows, many of the high class university don't want to be associated with agents.
My university classmates, who joined the corporates world, are now directors of MNC. They have no time. They work from Monday to Friday, OT after they come back home, work some more over the weekends. They can hardly breath, they hardly have time for family. Their spouse complain that they marry their work rather than them.
Those agents whom u said are from less educated background, have time to sleep in the morning, can go multiple holidays a year, have time for family and kids.
Every time I meet a client in the CBD area, I got a shock at how long the queue is. Do you know you don't have to join in the queue? I only go out on weekdays, in the morning, where there is no queue. I get to enjoy weekday discount rate. I hardly go out over the weekends, cos that's when all the crowds are out.
I have time to type out this reply during office hours.
My friends who are in the corporate world, often ask me how to join my industry, as they are sick and tired of reporting to work and facing those irritating colleagues or subpar boss. Yes, they already regional directors in their region.

This happened a while back but pertains to the govt giving out the gst voucher. I stay in a HDB and these ""friends"" are staying in condo/landed. We were first all excited being able to get the voucher until they realised that one of the criteria to get the voucher was to be staying in a HDB and they went into an uproar stating that it was not fair as it was not their house, but their parents' house. At the moment, it felt wrong for me to even be getting the voucher. It felt wrong to be ""poorer"". These same people were people who went on yearly holidays with their families to countries far away. Before I started university, the number of times I flew on a plane could be counted on one hand. If we are counting anything more than 4 hours, I don't even need the hand to count lol. One of them could get sneakers once every quarter and I was there with my 4 year old superstars ._.
Don't get me wrong, I was never poor. my family gave me the very best they could and I was never hungry, just never had as extensive opportunities as those ""friends"" and I would be lying if I said I wasn't jealous. I'm also not saying that the govt's way of setting their criteria is foolproof, but I do think it is a decently accurate indicator, especially for some younger folks.
We were younger then, but looking back, I realised how tone-deaf they were and I won't be surprised if they are still as tone-deaf. Privilege is very real and I am ashamed that they don't recognise it and based on what we studied, frankly find it ironic. The amount given to us by the govt seems like an additional bonus, but to those really needy, it could be a month or two worth of groceries and utilities etc. Needless to say we aren't really friends anymore.

Even women who make less than 4k a month can get men. But would you reject the men who want you?

When you intro your 5/10 friends a 5/10 match, and they reject, you call them superficial. But when you did the same to an 8/10, 9/10, 10/10 friend, it's 'ok' or perfectly normal if they don't like the looks, cause, well, 'looks matters' at the end of the day.

If a woman have enough good points but don't make enough money, most men will be willing to stay around and work together with you. Trust me, you wouldn't want a woman who will be with you just because you can earn 20k a month. Just like all people who want to have a relationship, we want someone who is willing to be with us through thick and thin. All you need to do, is to look past the 5/10's flaws, just as you would so profoundly speak of how 5/10s should just go for each other.
Focus on what you can work on. Calling out 5/10 men who goes for looks just as 8/10 men do, well, is just hypocrisy. We all have the same set of eyes, and that doesn't mean we deserve any less than what we want.
But above all, I still have faith that women like you would be able to find someone one day. He may not be your first choice, he may not be a perfect 10, but I can assure you, as long as you play your part as a decent person, lover, boyfriend or husband in this partnership and help each other blossom, he can become a perfect 10 in your eyes.
5/10 guys FTW

I think I'm a 2/10 woman or maybe a 1/10. Simply based on how I look. It doesn't matter how much I earn. By the way I earn around 6k and I'm already in my late 30s. I get passover for promotions because I don't look like a leader or I'm not pretty enough to be in meetings with the others. I notice the high fliers usually are the better looking ones and they are very engaging when they speak with others. I know I have none of that charisma. This is my first and only job since graduation. I know I have no drive and I am content to not work my way up.
I have already planned to stay with my parents and take care of them until they pass on so that's where my money is going should I pass on earlier than them.
All the men in my social circle have friendzoned me a long time ago. I have already resigned to the fact in this lifetime I will be attending everyone's wedding but my own. I will be buying baby gifts for everyone else's baby other than my own. I know my looks are way below average. So I never bothered with make up. I just made sure I'm neat, tidy and presentable for work.
I don't put myself out there so there is zero risk in being rejected. I've also started to only hang out with friends who are also single like me because I am tired of the pitiful looks other couples give me. I also know no one will ever have anyone in mind to introduce to me.
I do feel miserable sometimes. But I know no man will ever want to date me or even get to know me romantically. There's always another prettier girl. If there's a group photo of girls, I'll always be the ugliest one. The one that everyone don't remember seeing in the picture.
I do have other hobbies. I watch k drama. I like BTS. I play online games. I read books. Most of the time, I live in solitude.
Without knowing my looks, would any man dare to give me a chance? No.
There's always someone worse off than you.

We have been together for a year. Mostly our relationship's a good one and we are happy. She is in general an independent person but almost paradoxically at the same time is very obsessed over me. She tells me almost everyday how happy I make her.
Roughly once every two months so far she will get unusually angry over something small like maybe a text message from me to her where the tone can be misinterpreted as being not nice. She will get so unbelievably angry that she will write me walls of angry text, then tell me she is breaking up with me, then block me so I cannot reply. Occasionally she will unblock to write angry messages to me again then block me again. About a week later she will call to apologize. I will talk to her about not doing the same again and we get back together. Cycle repeats.
It is particularly stressful for me because when she says she is breaking up with me and block me, each time I have no idea if it is for real. And each time I believe the same will not happen again because we take the time to talk about each incident in detail after it happens. I have no reason to suspect any trigger because besides these occasional events, the relationship is going well.

60620,107136,"Dear Prof. Ben,
Just out of curiosity. Are your children as academically-inclined as you are? How do you recommend raising a kid who is bored with school because they find it too easy and slow?
I ask this because my son is showing signs of being way too advanced for his age. He is 11 and for two years now, he has ""hidden"" in my husband's study whenever he has time. My husband and I both work and I only got to know this through my helper. My husband has an applied math PhD from Michigan. The shelves in his study are filled with his old textbooks from school. After I found out that my son was spending an awfully long amount of time in his study, I ask my husband to check him out to see if he was actually learning anything. Turns out, according to my husband anyway, he already knows enough to ace college-level linear algebra and differential equations. My husband is now getting him started on number theory.
I should've been more attentive to the signs because his teachers have always told me that he was disruptive in class and never pays attention. He doesn't do homework, he doodles on his notes, he cracks jokes etc. But he has been among top 5-10 in his cohort despite not keeping up with his schoolwork. I'm afraid the lack of challenge will cause behavioral problems if this carries on.
Unfortunately neither my husband nor I make a lot of money. We don't know many options apart from hoping that he'd be streamed into a more competitive school at 13. My husband, who went to Hwa Chong, said that he'd be bored there too. I'm at my wit's end.

monetary compensation wise it is not as good as lawyer or banker. but the sense of satisfaction is priceless.

For those who have ego and pride and use anger to hide their embarrassment for being rejected. Come on. You can choose people, then people cannot choose you? Love is not a charity event.

If you have sufficient quality and assets, of course you will not blindly start a relationship with the first moving object that shows interest in you. Of course you would like to be with someone that you are equally attracted to. But do you attract that said person or you're not as great as you think you are?
Its very easy to blame others when something goes wrong in your life. But you learn nothing if you walk away without self reflection.
I have friends and role models around me who have coupled up since school days and have got married. Some did better than others. Some lived simpler lives. I know I'm fortunate to have positive influences in my life so I have learnt a lot from them. There's actually no secret formula to start a relationship but are you willing to face the truth about what you really are? Only when you truly know what you bring to the table then you can be realistic about what kind of a partner you can possibly find.
Why would you want to be with someone who wants out? Why would you want a shallow man or woman to be your special someone? You have to ask yourself why are you demanding love from someone who isn't interested?

60554,107004,"Am I the Asshole for requesting the teaching team stick to the original rubrics causing a regrade and everyone else to score even lower?
Hi everyone,
I'm a student in a course that recently had an assessment graded. It soon became apparent that there were inconsistencies in the grading, with some students receiving higher scores than they should have based on the rubrics.
I raised my concerns with the teaching team and requested that they stick to the original rubrics for grading, even if it meant that some students would have to be regraded and potentially receive lower scores. I felt that it was important to maintain the integrity of the grading process and ensure that everyone was being assessed fairly.
The teaching team agreed with my request and implemented a regrade. Unfortunately, this will result in some students receiving even lower scores than before, which has caused some tension and upset within the cohort.
While I understand that this situation is not ideal, I still believe that it was the right thing to do. In my opinion, it's important to adhere to the rubrics and maintain consistency in the grading process. I would hate to see students receive grades that do not accurately reflect their performance simply because the grading was not done fairly.
Here's a snippet of the reasoning and context behind the regrade:
As we all know, the one rule intimated to us well before the PE1 exam was even announced was that ""If the submitted classes or any of the new files you have added cannot be compiled, 0 marks will be given. Make sure your program compiles by running 'javac -Xlint:unchecked -Xlint:rawtypes *.java' before submission."" The exam paper also stated the rule, as above. Consequently, one of the biggest challenges and achievement, in fact, for exam candidates was to just get their code to compile.
I hope this post is read in its spirit, not just by the instructors, and compiled scripts' students, but also by those who had uncompiled scripts, so they can understand the fundamental issue at play here.
I, as a student myself, understand and sympathize that this rule was a tough one and a scary one, but I brought myself to terms with it, and understood the rationale that as computing professionals, compiled code should the minimum prerequisite in a Practical Exam. In the mock PE, practice PEs, even in the real PE at the 80-minute mark, we are intimated to ""make our code compile"". Every CS2030S student knows that debugging and making your code compile, is in fact, the most challenging and time-consuming task. As tough and scary and strict this ""0 marks for uncompiled code"" rule was, it was a rule nevertheless, and one that influenced our very approach towards PE1. It was not a test to write well designed code that cannot compile, it was a test to write compiled code that is well designed. I feel very strongly that the grading for PE1 has been inconsistent, and frankly unfair to everyone who spent a large proportion of their time debugging and making sure that their code compiles when the clock hits 90 minutes.
I will get a lot of hate for this, and naturally, this is an anonymous post. I'd just like to reiterate what I said earlier, a tough rule is a rule nevertheless. All of us were intimated of the rule from Day 1, and we all know that going into the PE1, our core goal was to get it to compile at least. Those of us who decided to take the risk, ignoring and defying the IMPORTANT rule given in the question paper were rewarded, while others who stuck to the hard limits and gave it our all to produce compiled code, adhering to the given rule, were in a way penalized, albeit relatively. Just as an example, a student over conscious of the compilation rule (as all students should have been) would have spent 65 minutes getting to a point in his question where he has compilation errors, and would have spent the next 25 minutes debugging, and possibly also removing or reversing some of his changes (changes that were OOP and Design principled) just to produce compiled code. On the other hand, a more risk-taking student would have 65 minutes getting to the same point, and upon encountering compilation errors would have just carried on implementing the other tasks, thinking he can debug and compile in the last 5 minutes, which in fact he/she was unable to do. Assuming both students have the same content understanding and coding skills, based on the inconsistent and unfair grading practiced, the first student would receive a far lower grade than the second one in PE1. This is not a made-up example; this is a real and a common occurrence among my peers.
Why I feel this grading is unfair and inconsistent is because the most important rule of the PE1 was conveniently made flexible to sympathize with students who couldn't compile their code.
Firstly, the single biggest rule that formed the very base of our approach, our fear, and ultimately our marks was disregarded entirely, maybe based on the score statistics (a high number of students receiving 0). I'd like to reiterate that no adjustments to the grades for the uncompiled scripts were made, not even a penalty, the only differentiating factor in grading between an uncompiled and compiled script was ability to pass test cases, which we all know, can be just a "","" ""."", ""-"" away for a compiled script, meanwhile completely out of reach for an uncompiled script.
Secondly and a more minor argument, other strict rules which had a even higher impact on the grades of compiled scripts were not even stated clearly in the question paper or intimated to us before the exam. I am referring to the following rules:
- getting the 2 marks of encapsulation right to be able to get 6 other marks, making the portion worth effectively 8 marks. A compiled script student may have left the existing code for 1-2 tasks simply because he spent time debugging and compiling his code for the other tasks.
- deleting unused code, functions and private fields, boilerplate code which would have no impact on your running was also penalized. A compiled script student may have left some helper and debugging functions and not dared to change anything at the last moment given the time constraint and the compile rule.
My point about inconsistency is highlighted in the 2nd point above in that the examiners' rationale for awarding uncompiled scripts equal marks is going to be something along the lines of ""We understand it's extremely stressful to have your code error free in 90 minutes, and this class is about design principles, and we awarded marks on that basis"". On the other hand, students who had their code compiled may have made the choice to not mess up their code in the final minutes owing to the same time constraint and stressful environment but were penalized for it. The same 90-minute stressful environment induces different decisions for different students but the students who choose to follow the rules, stay conscious of the single biggest requirement of the exam are inadvertently penalized, once through the sheer awarding of marks to uncompiled script, and secondly through these other ""Strict"" rules that are only realistically enforceable for compiled scripts. I mean if the instructors somehow understand and sympathize so heavily that 90 minutes is not enough to produce compiled code, so much so, that they change the single biggest fundamental rule of the PE, they should also understand and sympathize that 90 minutes is not enough to remove boilerplate code and unused methods/fields from one's compiled code.
In the end of this post, I'd like to quote a few sentences from an earlier thread in the hope that they further illustrate and back this post.
""Now they (uncompiled script) are only being penalized on correctness which means that they could potentially get 15/20 which is well above the upper quartile.""
""Moreover, some students even deleted parts, that would have otherwise been awarded marks under design, to ensure their code compiled.""
""I feel that it really violates the principles of academic integrity as the question paper/TA/profs/invigilators straight up lied to us about the consequences of not being able to compile our code.""
""Next, as mentioned above, the 2 marks of encapsulation include removing all the Array<Integer> etc from the skeleton code given. Just not removing those fields caused some students to lose 9 marks as correctness and style were not even considered if encapsulation was not ""correct"". I personally faced this issue and my code did not use any of the Array<Integer> etc declared.""
""It is greatly disappointing that one of the most emphasised 'warnings' for the PE is also the greatest pitfall for many students who heeded it, yet were punished for not taking risk.""
""One of the reasons for the ""can't compile, 0 marks"" policy mentioned by the instructors was that as computer science students, the benchmark would be that we should be able to compile our code. Although I do suppose perhaps out of kindness or to even out the bellcurve, the teaching department has decided to still mark the work of students who weren't able to compile their code. However, I do hope that it is also clear that there are tradeoffs in every decision, including disparaging the care that students took in following instructions.""
The question is not if the ""cannot compile, 0 marks"" rule is fair or adequate, the question here is whether disregarding it entirely, and not considering the efforts of those who spent considerable time adhering to it, so much so as to go back and reverse/delete what could have been ""perfectly designed"" code, the question is if disregarding their efforts, and compliance to rules is fair.
One counter that I hear from my peers is they probably did this to reduce stress. My point here is that if they really wanted to reduce stress, they should have done it before the PE itself, changing a rule deemed tough for several years before the exam would have been fair to everyone and successfully met the goal of reducing emotional stress. Changing it according to performance of students and announcing it a month later does no good in reducing stress for someone who was already aware and had accepted his 0 marks. All it does is take the focus away from rules, and make students question and regret their choices, even when they'd religiously followed the rules.
This grading pattern sets a terrible precedent for PE2, where if just enough students get a 0, they'll not all get a 0. A given student would have no idea what rules to follow, what not to follow, how the grading will take place, what specific convenient frame of reasoning will be followed for the next PE. If they did
However, some of my classmates are now upset with me for requesting the regrade and causing their scores to be lowered. They feel that I should have just accepted the initial grades and not caused any trouble.
So, I'm turning to you, to ask: AITA for requesting the teaching team stick to the original rubrics causing a regrade and everyone else to score even lower? Was I wrong to prioritize fairness and consistency over my classmates' grades? I'm genuinely interested in hearing your opinions.

We also got into an argument bc he was going to his relative's house and he said he will leave my place at 6pm, he then received a call from his mom and her telling him that shes otw to the location and he immediately ditched me two hours earlier than the agreed timing. He then blamed me for being selfish and taking away his family time when all i needed was to find out why the sudden change in attitude bc at the start of the rs, he would do whatever to maximise and spend more time with me knowing that both our love language is quality time.
Im more upset at the fact that i got baited than anything else? If only he didnt treat me like that from the beginning maybe i wouldnt have this high standards from him and when I told him how I felt hurt and neglected lately, he got furious and said how I dont appreciate his efforts anymore and hes loyal? As if being loyalty isnt the bare minimum

60564,107023,"Where are men to find good women these days? A lot of so-called modern women come with a shopping list of attributes they expect from a man whilst hardly bringing anything to the table themselves. I mean, just look at some of the posts and comments from women on this page, many of them with overinflated egos and sense of self-worth seem to think they deserve the best men without even putting in any effort or having the ideal qualities of a woman. If a guy was to make a list of feminine attributes he expects in a potential partner, it would probably look something like this: No previous sexual relations, cooks, cleans, looks after the kids, supports and honours her husband, doesn't entertain other guys. How many of you fit the bill? When we look at the state of women today, it is appalling to see the sheer number flirting around on dating apps, hoeing on onlyfans, shaking their asses on tiktok, sleeping around, demanding that men do this and that for them. It seems like good women have been lost in the great hoeflation of our times.

I loved him a lot and had made plans for a future together. We had plenty of potential as couple and there were more good times than bad.
I heard from mutual friends that he has moved on quickly and has been actively dating from dating apps.

60594,107088,"#107071 if her parents dont like you, means u ggxx already.
Why her parents dont like you got 3 main reasons
1) not rich enough/poorly educated
2) impolite to them
3) different colour/beliefs
The key to all 3 is be humble, send lots of gifts, apologise/kneel at door if needed, and continue to send gifts, display sincerity, convert if necessary, basically wear down their suspicions with your patience.
Eventually you will get her but whether you will be happy long term is another story
Or you can just walk out of the relationship, hold your head high, and be yourself.

60619,107142,"Alright before I rant it out, I’d like to be clear to everyone that I have no offence against any jobs or occupations or careers here, as I’m just voicing out my personal opinions.
Having graduated from local uni for 3 years since the pandemic, I’ve worked for 2 companies, and I’d say they’re both pretty fulfilling, as I get to learn a lot of new skills, how to deal with clients especially problematic ones, liaise with customers, having courage to argue with my bosses whenever necessary, pretty much equipped myself with a lot of skills to upgrade myself. However, some of my insurance agent acquaintances and friends who became these so called wealth planners or financial agents have been approaching me to persuade me to join them, telling me things like oh with your skills, you can definitely make it, you have the potential to become very successful, you can easily achieve MDRT within 1-2 year’s time based on your strong selling skills, blab la bla, so on and so forth.
Honestly I’ve met quite a number of insurance agents, be it from uni, from gym, from dating apps, from friends/acquaintances, and 90% of them graduated from private uni, are uni dropouts, or didn’t even complete go to poly/JC, and that is the main reason why I stay away from this industry. They can be ah lian, girls who dress up as if they’re on catwalk, guys with tattoos that are easily noticeable. No offence guys, to me, there are plenty of other jobs that make a good living as well, and these jobs do require uni degrees such as lawyer, doctor, pharmacist, scientist, engineer, lecturer, teacher, merger and acquisition, corporate banker, etc. I really don’t wish to waste my degree on a job that doesn’t need a degree AT ALL. Yes, if I do well, if I can sell, if I can maintain good relationship with client, if I can expand my network, I can make a ton of money from selling wealth plans and my degree is no longer important. I get it, I’m totally aware of it. But from my stand point, I just don’t understand why people keep thinking that we must or more like we should join insurance to make money, I seriously don’t get it. It's just like prostitution, yes, it's legal, you can make a living out of it, but I don't enjoy the job so I don't do it. In fact, I got so mad at one of them and told him straight to his face “eh any tom dick and harry can go join your prudential as long as they put on suit and tie, and can sell, stop trying to pull me in”.
Is it wrong for enjoying a career that requires a uni degree that I enjoy every single day? Frankly speaking, my preference to stay away from a career that is pursued by most less-educated people and unwilling to associate myself with similar people especially those who didn’t go to uni is really just a preference. I don’t enforce anyone to follow my actions, I don’t discriminate them when I’m doing my job, and I certainly never think that it is wrong to pursue a career catered mostly to those less-educated. In fact, in my previous job, I had to deal with any type of customers, and I had a great time talking to them for hours and meeting them for contract discussion outside office.
So guys, if any of your friends DO NOT want to join insurance, just stop forcing them to join. Just take it as we don’t fancy flexing our BMW and Rolex on the Gram can bruh???

They started to mutter things like ""wah see the head roll out the car"", ""hands and legs fly everywhere sia!"", ""someone die leh and blood everywhere you see a not.""

Graduated from NUS, landed a job in an investment bank in Singapore as entry level. After working for a year, managed to seize an opportunity to do internal transfer to UK for the same job. But i am facing some discrimination from my manager , and team dynamics is not going well. I am still doing well for my own assigned things, and received positive feedback. However I am having issue with my current manager, who frequently says that she do not understand my accent. I work harder than the rest and usually overtime without extra pay to bear more responsibilities.
However, the discrimination is getting to me to the point that I want to do another internal transfer. However, i am currently stuck on 5 year contract with my current team due to visa related issues.
Can I seek your advise on whether I should consider an internal transfer, to maintain better work life balance and career progression. Or continue sticking to current team to fulfill 5 year obligations.

Thanks to my mum I'm a D albeit having a 24 inches waist and my body fat percentage hovers around 19% naturally. I'm also rather tall for girls at 168cm and weigh 51kg.
But, who cares right? Because I'm just a despo sci girl desperate for my cells to not die and for my experiments to work. No one would want to date me even if I'm a 8/10 because I simply don't have time. The only living creature that I get to meet is my cell culture but when they die they die and they don't care if I'm a 8/10 or 1/10.

60551,106997,"Reply to #106986
I relate with how you feel because my boyfriend is also similar.. We hang out once a week on sat & he eats at home on other days with his mom, which I don’t really mind because we can call and text.
BUT sometimes on sat he will at times ditch me 30 minutes before our scheduled time because his mom wants to have lunch together. His mom accompanies him to EVERY doctor & dental appointment. Guess what? It’s always on sat (I don’t know whether it’s coincidental or what). I don’t even know what time I’m meeting him and he always have his meals with her so I’m always eating alone =(
i felt uncomfortable deep down but I try very hard to be understanding … I mean, logically speaking, we are just his girlfriend (not his wife right?) and as compared to his mom who has brought him up for so long we should learn how to respect and give in. Also I don’t want to make things difficult for my bf.
Not too sure about your case though, my advice is that you need to think through , is he the only son? Is his mom a single mom? Etc. in my case I don’t know why his mom is so clingy because he has 4 other siblings (3 guy 1 girl) and he’s the 3rd in line. I wonder if his mom treats the rest the same as well? Or maybe because I’m from a single family (no mom) so I don’t understand that feeling? Haha
For the time being, I am trying to adopt a positive mindset. I feel that instead of being angry that your bf does this, why not be filial to his mother together? (Unless his mom really hates you la..then can’t be helped) if you are going to marry him in the long run then you have to try to get used to his family culture. From there, I think (hope) that he will appreciate your actions, and from there you can try to talk to him about how you actually feel and work things out together, instead of just telling him that “please accommodate to my needs”. Sometimes we really need to see from both sides of the story.
Nothing wrong with being a mommy boy and loving you at the same time :)
All the best to you!

After reading some of the comments, I feel extremely disappointed as I felt all along I have been working towards the wrong direction. Through my entire life, my father kept emphasizing on ""Man Perfection"" / ""男子汉"". I was taught to believe I had to be perfect in order for girls to like me. Throughout my entire childhood and teen years, I studied and worked at the same time in order to build up my savings. I told myself I had to move out and have everything at a young age so that I can get a happy family. I rejected all forms of relationships especially in my teen years in order to increase my savings, which I began to regret as many of my homeland friends are happily attached to their partners (whom they met since they were 18).
Now I am 25 and beginning to worry as everyone in my social circle is beginning to get married while I am still single. My friends expressed their jealousy as with the lottery money I win coupled with my savings, I had everything they want at our age. But what they do not realize is they had everything I want. They have a healthy relationship and received love from it. I am starting to feel my hardwork is all for nothing as I always thought my effort will finally give me a happy family, which I did not get to experience in my childhood with my parents busy working.
I know people often mentioned love depends on fate and cannot be forced, but I really tried. I tried to be the best person I can be in order to gain others' recognition. I sacrificed my entire childhood, teen years, as well as early 20s to get where I am here. But I still could not get what I really want. Love.

We are a group of close friends since secondary school, whom are all married/engaged/attached except for A. We are finding it difficult to communicate with A as he enjoys talking about his ""relationship"". We don't see this as a problem, considering how people around us are at this ""time to settle down"" stage in life.
A is an evergreen, early thirties, desperately wanting to meet the love of his life naturally and has no intention to meet new people.
Nothing extreme but we have resorted to referring to our own partner as ""friend"" to avoid the topic as much as we can. If somehow he manages to bring us to the topic, he goes on and on about how single af/left out/left behind he is/ how difficult it is to meet someone, unlike us who got it easy.
Like many other relationships, we met people who then became our partners in school or workplace. He has never dated anyone, never had a crush on anyone. Back in uni days, he shared with us about this one experience he had with a course mate who had confessed to him. She was a pleasant and bubbly girl. We had fun teasing him and tried to match them up. As he did not share the same feelings, he simply told the girl he had no time to date.
Months later, he was suddenly mad and shared how the girl is already dating another course mate and he felt betrayed. He then labeled her a two-timer and all sort of names. Thing is they were never together? The girl is definitely the bigger person. Whenever they see each other at school, she would smile no matter how awkward we thought it would be. A would then continue his insults behind her. Years later, he would refer to her as his ex. An ex who two-timed him and hurt him deeply.
We suggested he could try using dating app or even match making companies. He often says they are useless because he prefers to know someone in real life naturally and not through such methods. Note that he is a homebody. We tried match making our single friends to him, he would reject because it is too awkward for him to meet someone with the purpose to date. As far as we know, noone in his family is pressuring him to marry. His parents are cool even if he remains single.
Are you able to imagine the sort of conversations we have with him? Often, a fun get together would end with this awkward and lousy vibe. With him just whining about being alone, dying alone while the world goes on. He is always on social media, being bitter about friends who posted photos of travels with their partner, getting engaged, getting married, some already with kids (we always get a first hand update of a screenshot from FB along with his comment).
My dear friend, we are at wits' end to help if you put in 0% effort to get out of your comfort zone.
