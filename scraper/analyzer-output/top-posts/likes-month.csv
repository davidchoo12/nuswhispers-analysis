61177,108341,"Asian parents please don't alienate your children. 
I am in married, female, and in my 40s. I had a very traditional asian father growing up that believed in tough love, corporal punishment and all that. We were not rich. Dad did what he thought was right. I ended up working in the civil service and my brother found success in sales/business. 
However, due to our upbringing, my brother hated (understatement) father. Dad would use traditional arguments, such as he brought us up, he spent money on us, yada yada to force brother to comply. 
Since brother was rich already, he wrote a cashiers order for a few million, passed it to my dad as ""repayment"" for all the years of resources, opportunity costs. He then doubled the amount of money to ""buy my freedom"" too. Brother then walked out of dad's life forever. 
Over the years, dad did not attend my brothers wedding, or meet his gf/wife. My dad doesn't know his own grandson. 
Dad died a few months back due to cancer. And in his deathbed. He confessed to me that driving brother away was his biggest, lifetime regret and he hopes to reconcile. Dad was hard on brother because he needed to teach him how to be a ""man"". He was extremely proud of my brother. My bro turned out to be the ideal son. Successful man that takes care of his own family.
That didn't happen. Brother didn't even attend his funeral.
After dad's death, we found out that he didn't touch the millions all these years. We wanted to return bro the money but bro objected, claiming that this money cannot be taken back. We decided do donate it to charity, brother also donated his entire share of my dad's estate to charity...
It's too late for our family. But I hope all asian, stern parents... just tell your kid that you love them.

61188,108355,"In response to #108326, true success isn't solely defined by wealth and privilege; it's about finding joy in the life you lead. I hail from Singapore, graduated from NUS, and initially worked there. Frustrated by the rat race and endless pursuit for salary, I relocated to New Zealand. Despite a mortgage and fewer material possessions, life here brings me more fulfillment. While my paycheck may not match my Singaporean peers', my workday ends at 4:30 pm, free from emails and meetings. Weekends and leave are sacrosanct, spent serving at a soup kitchen, enjoying quiet evenings, cooking with my wife, and embarking on weekend road trips. It may not be a life of high pay and conventional success, but it's a life well worth living.

61219,108424,"Took me several years to accept that it is okay to work for the family business.
In places like Japan or Italy, business get passed down through the generations. People are proud to take over businesses from their parents. Here in Singapore, I've always felt that there's a stigma around doing the same.
My dad is 100% owner of a business he inherited from his grandfather. Without going into too much detail, he is the sole distributor in Singapore of several German and American brands of refined chemical products. We serve customers from malls, to factories, to households. It is a medium-sized company. Growing up, as an only son, I was told that this business will be mine. I would respond that I am not interested in it and that one day I will start my own business. It didn't help that I went to HC where it wasn't particularly helpful for my peers to know that I'm from a privileged background. I played it down and made sure my peers knew that I will be getting a job like everyone else when I graduate.
After NS, I went to study Systems Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Penn. After which I went to work in Silicon Valley for two years before doing an MBA at Columbia. Then I got a job as a strategy consultant. Several years ago my dad had a small stroke. He was comatose for a week. He was able to make a full recovery from that incident but he told me that since I wasn't interested, he was going to wind up the company. More than 100 families will be affected, included those who have worked for my father for more than 30 years. I ruminated for a day or two and decided to quit my job and come home.
Today, as a man in his 30s who have rejected the idea of inheriting my family business my whole life, I am the full owner and CEO of an SME which I grew by more than 40% in the last two years.
I still feel bad that I never quite earned my position at this company and would rather have started one on my own. But the more I start to change things in my dad's company, introducing technologies and workflows that make it easier for our employees to do their jobs, I am starting to accept that just because I'm privileged doesn't mean I can't still provide a service to my customers and employees. I still get ""looks"" from my friends that I haven't done enough to earn what I have today, but I guess I'm going to have to learn to live with it.

61173,108334,"Just recently, I had a chat with 2 of my part time working friends while we were studying in uni.
It is really sad that we share the same struggle. Let’s call girl A and another girl B.
Girl A has to pay off her father house loan for another 30 years as her father had refinanced the house under her name just to pay off gambling debts. 
Father doesn’t work and her mother resigned from work to take care of girl A’s daughter. 
Worse of all, she is going through divorce as her husband has been absent since she gave birth. The daughter is now 3years old and he has never visited their daughter more than 10 times.
Girl B, she is paying off her parents debt due to their failed business + gambling. Monthly around 3k which is shared with her brother. Her parents don’t work so she has to pay for all expenses such as house rental, utilities and food alone. 
For me, my mum likes to play 4D, our family has been paying off her debt because she went and borrow money from outsider.  My father used to gamble but he quit long time ago. We have been nagging at her to stop borrowing money from outsider as the interest will be super high and you don’t know who u’re messing with. You might get ur family member in trouble! Bt she never listens. I am tired of talking to her and nagging the same thing over.
I feel like this generation, the kids especially, are paying off the debts for your parents. I’m grateful for them to raise us up and giving us foods under a roof. But do they really think that we are their retirement package? I do feel bad when I think like this. I can give them money for food and necessities, but not for gambling. 
This is what really saddens me. 
No wonder nowadays the population is getting lesser. Please don’t reproduce and treat your kids like ATM or retirement package.

61198,108391,"I have a similar experience to the artist cousin in #108338.
I trained as an electrical engineer. Worked for a few years in the semiconductor industry. I hated every moment of my degree, I hated every moment of my work. I was good at math and physics in JC and EE was just an obvious choice. I also came from a humble background so money was a consideration. I made the transition to software, hated it less but I still loathed the work. 
Few years ago, I decided to quit everything and started my own indoor farm. I am excited to go to work everything and it is a feeling I hope most of you reading will feel at least for a few years in your life. I don’t want to go into specifics but we raised $5M last year. Because of the type of crops we chose, and clever decisions we made by focusing on produce and not so much on automation/tech, we make very good money out of this. We are profitable, which is very rare for high tech farms. 
I wouldn’t go back to EE or SWE even if you doubled my current income. I now generate more than double in profit than my last drawn income working for a FAANG company. The only difference, as far as I can tell, is my passion for watching my plants grow. 
The other reason why following your interests, provided you’re not evidently bad at it, is because you can keep at it for far longer. Time is needed to get good. But if you hate what you do, it’s really hard to convince yourself to want to become good at something. Passion is needed to really dig deep into any subject.
If you are like me, i.e you’re naturally good at something you really hate, then you need to decide whether it is ultimately worth it to keep doing it for the money or whether you need to find a different path. I don’t think it is very common for people to be good at what they hate although I have met a few.

61200,108377,"Is it mandatory to pay for wedding guest accommodation and flight tickets?
I half chinese/filipino PR 24F, and my Indonesian chinese singaporean fiance 27M are deciding whether to get married in SG or Philippines as we have about 200 pax guest to cover.
In SG for that amount of guests, wedding costs would go up to 50k or more.
But in Philippines would be less than 20k.
50-60 out of the 200 guest are from my fiance side + friends and the rest (150+) resides in php. Which means having a wedding in php would be more convenient.
But I’ve heard from some of my friends that if we were to invite them to an overseas wedding, we should be responsible for their flight as well as accommodation costs too.
And a rountrip ticket to php would be about $300 each. So overall $15k+ for 50pax which is almost the wedding cost at php???? Is there an option to buy in bulk and how much cheaper would it be? 
Also is it a must to pay for their tickets as well as accommodations?
Or does anyone know how we can do a 20k wedding in sg for about 100pax at least?

61176,108339,"Another thing to mention about IQ is the fact that the top IP/IB schools have IQ averages around 120 (if you use top British and American schools as an analog bearing in mind that our students regularly outperform their American and British counterparts). Pick out any student from Hwa Chong or RI and they'd likely be in the very top percentile of natural intellectual giftedness. I went to both Hwa Chong and RI and my experience is people are very smart across the board. What manifests as differences in academic performance in these schools are due to things not related to genetics. By my observation it is mostly work ethic.
There was several students in my graduating cohort at RJC who did poorly for A-levels who went on to become absolute beasts in their college years, two of whom are now pursuing PhDs at Stanford and Columbia. The boy who is at Stanford got three Cs at A-levels and I know him to be one of the biggest slackers. When I last meet him he was a changed person. Cerebral almost.
Why do I mention only the top schools? Assuming the top 10% of high schooler leavers in Singapore goes to any of SMU/NUS/SUTD/NTU, it is likely that students are more genetically similar than different. Possibly the reason there are people who do well in CS vs people who don't do well in CS is more due to a wrong selection of course. i.e People who are not doing well in CS perhaps would have been FCH in another course but they pick CS despite not having much talent. In Hwa Chong students are taught computing since sec 1. There is no excuse, particularly for those from my alma mater, not to have known that they do not have a talent for CS.
Here's another anecdote. I know a friend who was in accounting. He had a terrible time with it. He found it extraordinarily difficult for whatever reason. Midway through his second year he switched to CS at a top engineering school in Pittsburgh. He graduated with a 4.0. He now works at a hedge fund in New York.
To the students of NUS who are not doing well:
1. You probably need to fix your work ethic.
2. You probably need to be in a different course.
3. You are probably not so much stupider than the top student in your course, you just need to use your brain in a different field.
I was a middling computing student who turned out to be one of the most sought after programmers in Silicon Valley. My salary reflects this. Work is also quite different to school. I don't know if people would agree. I also don't know if all of Ben's top students are doing amazingly but I certainly am an outlier. I was his student and he'd probably think I wouldn't get far in life given how badly I did in his class.

61171,108332,"I stumbled onto this page few months ago and I'm disturbed about the recent discussion on EE and Engineering. They are being treated as a dumping ground today compared to courses like CS.
I'm an EE alumni. I graduated a long time ago, 33 years ago to be exact which is easily more than most of your have been alive.  I'm your old senior.
I would like to share my observations and advice to my EE juniors reading this who may have jealous thoughts of their CS friends.
In my time, Engineering especially Electrical Engineering were prestigious courses. CS was the dumping ground. CS undergrads were usually those who failed to enter EE or those who could not handle the rigor of the EE curriculum and thus had to drop to an easier degree. 
Let me quantify this factually, EE graduates are usually acceptable for software roles as proved by most job advertisements. The converse is not true, you will never find any CS graduate in roles like electronics, PCB layout, ASIC, RF, optics, high-power systems etc because they are simply not qualified for them. Given the versatility of jobs EE graduates can do compared to CS, it is obvious which is the objectively more superior degree. One can learn CS on your own but picking up EE skills by yourself is impossible.
CS being the dominant course today is a temporary aberration. 
EE and Engineering will never disappear because it is the foundation of the modern world. In my decades in the Engineering industry, an Engineering career is actually the most stable compared to software which I observed goes through more rapid boom and bust cycles.
My advice to you all is that EE while a hard and multi-disciplinary course but it is for your own good. Stick it out to graduation and the whole world awaits you. Hardware jobs, software jobs, you have the flexibility to do anything compared to your CS friends. 
Versatility, domain knowledge and generalist skills are highly sought after in the future job market. Coding which CS grads mostly do will soon be rendered increasingly obsolete with AI tools like ChatGPT and commoditization and accessibility of programming skills.

61170,108329,"AITA (TLDR): Some background first, I am the younger of 2 boys (4 yrs gap) in a family. When growing up, I was always the 'fav' child due to my traditional parents' thinking of 'rewarding when good, punishing when bad' mentality. My results had always been better than my bro as I am those who is goal oriented. In case u r thinking is academic results goal, no but watching cartoons goal coz my mum won't let me watch TV if I dun meet her demands. So I was one of those who finished the assessment books in half a year type during Pri Sch. 
My bro, on the other hand, got into trouble since Sec 3. He was involved in gangs and thefts and was even caught in a departmental store before. So my bro was not happy with me since young as I got things I wanted. 
Life in Pri Sch was quick for me but one incident stayed with me. One day, while I was at home, my dad came home early from work and hid in the room. I was instructed to lie to say he wasn't at home. True enough, loan sharks came and I did what I did. This incident stuck with me ever since. 
Life continued and I went through the JC-Uni route, and got a scholarship to pay for my fees with allowances while my bro dropped out of school in Sec sch. My mum was really the happy one as she told me they didn't have enough for my fees anyway. Then in Uni, during my year 3 final exams, I got a call from my bro, telling me my dad had a woman outside. He asked me who I would go with, and my answer was my mum. This was the second major incident. 
After exams when I went home (I stayed in hostel), my dad had a long chat with me. He came up with some story that the woman was giving him money to meet his financial troubles and was disappointed I chose my mum over him as he felt he loved me sufficiently to forgive such a thing. At that moment, I felt the irony as they had been very fair since young. While my bro got into trouble, they helped him to learn a skill and get a job but didn't give him too much (or rather they could not afford to I guess). 
Fast forward, both my bro and I got our own family, each with 2 boys, and our own place. My parents had a 3-rm flat and had been renting out for a long time. My parents would stay at my bro's place on Sun night to Thu night, and come over to mine for the weekend as my bro didn't want to send his kids to infant care. My relationship with my bro is also normal, but fantastically close and on talking terms. On the other hand, my bro had never had a healthy relationship with my dad since the second incident. 
My mum suddenly passed away after being diagnosed of cancer a few years ago. Since then, my dad had lived off the rental, his own salary (combined to be about $4k/mth), and savings left over by my mum. He told me the amount left was about $40k. Less than 3 mths after my mum passed, my dad moved to my place citing difficulties living with my brother. It was during this time, he told me he had a PRC 'girlfriend' of 6 yrs (which means before my mum's death). 
He also started telling me he dun want to leave the HDB to my bro and wanted to 'will' it to me. It didn't feel right to me so I told him not to do so as I felt the HDB also included my mum's share which she would leave it fairly to both of us. Then one day, he came home with a letter from a lawyer citing that he found a loophole and had left an instruction to pass the decision-making on what to do with the HDB and the money to me (whatever that is). It didn't bother me as I was sure I will pass half to my bro. Some months passed, and he asked me for a loan of a few grand coz he owed my uncle about $30k. I passed the money to him. 
A couple of weeks later, he asked me for money as his girlfriend was leaving SG for good and he wanted to give her money for the years of companionship. You can imagine my answer. How would I give money to you to pass to a woman who is not my mum? 
Then the ridiculous event happened, about 2-3 mths later, he came home, said he needed to talk me something serious, and I guessed it, he sold the HDB. He cited that he owed my uncle close $xxx,xxx, and he got no choice. After calculations by him, he would left about $100k cash. 
It was at this moment when I put all the bs he was pulling together. But I didn't bother to expose him. A few days passed, so I decided to do a 'test'. He asked him for the same uncle's number and meet him as I had a friend who needed some contacts in China. My uncle used to run some importing from China for his shop and some of his business friends regularly. So my dad gave me some excuses that he would ask my uncle for permission first. So basically the 'test' failed. But again I didn't bother to expose him. 2 days later, he saw me at home and said he could help me pass the message and maybe get the China contact for me etc. 
This was when I could not take it anyway. I told him off straight away. I told him that from the many stories he told me, it wasn't hard to guess which is true, which is bs. All these while, he was trying to get me to give him money to that girlfriend and suddenly debt with my Uncle ballooned to 6 figures. He dare not let me meet my Uncle in person as I was trained in micro expressions and I could tell if someone was lying through questions and observing the behaviours. I also gave him a piece of my mind about how he used to compare himself with some relatives of ours on how good he was, but he is turning into them, or worse. I left the house and after that, he moved back to my bro's place. 
My bro called me and we started sharing the different stories of what he told both sides. Then apparently, my mum left more than $100k for him, not the $40k he claimed. It was about 2.5 yrs, and I did a calculation. To finish all the money he had within 2.5 yrs, he had to spend about $7k or more a month. That was crazy amount to me as I dun spend $7k for my family of 4. My bro also revealed another incident. He was found with another woman (which almost ended in a divorce too) when I was much younger in my lower pri, but my mum instructed my bro to keep it from me. 
My dad had basically cut all contacts with me, and my bro and I are not talking to him much. We only see one another when we are praying to my mum. 
AITA here?

61209,108396,"I'm in a dilemma. I have a friend who is nice, amiable, friendly and generally a good-natured person that people are okay with. He is also very brother to me, and trusts me too. The only problem that has started to really bother me is that he physically cheats on his gf almost every other week. He goes to lupsup KTVs, the hostesses there often throw themselves at him (he's conventionally attractive), and he always reciprocates, some nights even sending them back home - only God knows what he really does there. 
I don't personally know his gf, that's why I never really felt it was my place to say anything. Once, I casually inquired if they were doing okay, and he always says they're doing fine and that she's super stable, not toxic, doesn't pick fights with him etc. This then made me pity his gf more, because I thought maybe if he was at least really upset with his gf, it'd make his behaviour a little more excusable (as his close friend ok). In fact, their relationship is not rocky at all, they are very stable, had BTO-ed, and he posts her very often on his Instagram etc.
At first, I didn't think they were going to last long because he always spoke about her as if she was a very convenient ""place-holder"" kind of gf, loves him more than he does, not his usual type, she chased him first, kind of way. So these were factors that made me believe I should mind my own business and let things naturally fall apart when they should. After all, he's my good friend right? I ain't no snitch. BUT, I started feeling uncomfortable when he told us he had proposed to her, WHILE we were at the KTV, with a hostess in his arms LOL. I just really really pity the gf so much, because she's so so clueless about what he does during nights he's without her. 
I started wondering why the hell does she not go through his phone like usual gfs do, or check his grab/gojek history once in awhile, or get location-tracking apps together etc. It would at least deter him from thinking she's way too easy to cheat on ma, right? Lesser tendency to want to cheat, knowing he would have to take extra steps etc. It's just a very sad situation... she seems like a very nice introverted yet bubbly girl too. She is unknowingly going to marry someone that does not even truly love her. And is probably giving her STD/STIs. I hope she gets herself checked one day.
I'm sure he does like her for him to stay with her for this long, and thinks she's wifey-material etc, but let's all agree he's definitely not in love with her. Hahahaha. What would you guys do? Would yall snitch on your bro or just let the poor girl (who you don't personally know) live her life out naturally in (fake) bliss?

61175,108338,"Following your interests (conditional on it being a reasonably remunerated profession) is not how you become poor, it's how you avoid becoming poorer. I think too often we focus all our time and energy trying to figure out which industry (or major) pays the most while we spend almost no time trying to figure out what we're good at *and* interested in. There are a lot of ways to make money, but you don't do it by being mediocre. I see a lot of people going into investment banking, management consulting, software engineering, law, medicine, despite not having much interest in these professions beforehand. I have also seen people who are hyper-focused at what they really liked doing and made more money than top lawyers or doctors. My cousin is an example. Growing up he was obsessed with MS Paint. Yes, Microsoft Paint. The stuff he used to draw with a mouse was superior to anything I could have ever drawn by hand. Nobody thought he would make anything of this hobby. He did an arts degree eventually and we all thought he would be homeless. My parents certainly did. Today he runs a digital marketing company that does everything from websites to video commercials. He has more than 50 people working for him and he makes more money in a month than I can make in a year as a lawyer. I studied law and I'm not even a lawyer now because I only did law because my mom forced me to. I do consulting which I also hate.
I'm not jealous or anything (well I am a little but also proud of him) but just thought I should share some life lessons.

61201,108380,"I'm currently on a 2 yr contract with an MNC that is ending in late Feb, upon which I will get a 1 mth completion bonus. However, as per the T&C of my contract,  I am able to tender my resignation by serving one month notice any time within the contract period.
I recently started job hunting and have received a verbal offer (pending official letter) from another company. It's a full time position. However the company has indicated that due to some upcoming project they would not be able to wait till Mar for me to fulfil my contract at my current company before joining them. They have asked if I am able to do a 1 month notice, as per my contract T&C.
Now, my dilemma is due to the close time frame. Out of obligation I do want to finish the contract but the new company needs me to join in Feb and cannot wait. If I were to resign before my contract is up, I would also lose the completion bonus. I'm concerned I'll be seen as burning bridges or unprofessional, as I would be leaving in the middle of an important project. Plus, it's just the last leg of my contract. In an ideal situation I would prefer to finish the contract then join the new Co but unfortunately they cannot wait.
For context, the new job is offering slightly higher than what I'm drawing now. Leave, bonus and benefits are typical, nothing to rave about. However it is a permanent position and there seems to be room for learning and career growth.
Will you choose to forgo the offer since the time isn't right and just go back to job hunting or break the contract at this awkward juncture and risk burning bridge.

It has been heartwarming for me when I look through the comments. Thank you to those who left words of encouragement and motivation. 
Regarding about the past relationship with the boyfriend who cheated, I am relieved to comment that I have fully let go and moved on. The future is going to be come better!!
As for my career, I came to a realisation that due to intense pressure of being a breadwinner in my family, I have been pushing myself too hard. It was not a job that I was truly connected to. It was only a job that minimum pays well to feed myself and my family. 
As a result of pushing myself too hard, my health suffered. I am planning to take leave in Feb 2024 to replenish my health.

61179,108386,"Hi Prof Ben, I've always appreciated your advice and hope you can help me out on this issue with my wife.
I'm married to my wife for a year now and things have started going downhill after we moved in together. My wife has anger management issues and turns violent when things don't go her way.
Her temper has never been great but it was only after moving in that I truly knew how bad it was. She has OCD and insists many things be done her way. I tried to comply but sometimes I'm lazy and don't do things that she wants or meets her standards. Sometimes I complain about her OCD and snap back at her for her ridiculous demands and it offends her.
Bad temper, OCD and a sloppy husband (me) is never a good combination. When she's offended, she will go into a huge rage, start screaming that I don't respect her needs and on serious occasions, start hitting me. Usually I get pounded on the shoulder but today I started receiving slaps and she threw the remote at my face, resulting in a bruise on my eye.
I'm not sure what to do now. I know I'm not perfect but physical violence is a line I don't think should be crossed. I want her to stop using physical violence to get her way but I don't want to report it to the police for fear of the repercussions to her. Neither do I want a divorce.
Help please!

61214,108410,"Hi Admin, deeply appreciate if you can post my story up. I'm in my late 20s & graduated from uni recently. My dad has always been borrowing money (from part time jobs I've saved) from me even while I was in uni working. He'd never paid for my uni fees. I paid on my own. Those money loan from me were never returned as he promised he would. I lost trust towards him since then.
Now as I graduated, he said he's old and wants me to take over his car mortgage payment which I have 0% ownership in. He doesn't wants to pay anymore but expect me to pay $3,200 monthly. I told him to sell, but he refuses as he wants to portray he has the ""ability"" infront of his friends.
I know, fillial piety is indeed a must as I'm grateful he brought me up. But I am barely surviving with my current salary and I don't have much savings. I'm ok to give him expenses but not ok to pay for his liability which he assured he would pay for it. He's being so irresponsible now. 
When I didn't nod my head to lend him money, he told his friends his child is so calculative now need help also don't want to help him out.
I'm pretty torn apart mentally. I'd love to help if I have tons of millions of dollars but I have my own future marriage, home, and own liabilities as well.

61180,108385,"I’m reaching out for some advice regarding a situation with a close friend. We’ve known each other since secondary school and have been through thick and thin together. We are both studying in uni now. However, recently, she’s adopted a minimalist lifestyle. 
She has embraced minimalism to the extent of donating most of her clothes, retaining just a few essential items, and reducing her shoe collection to 2-3 pairs. Her commitment extends to her diet as well; she’s become a vegan and often expresses her disapproval when I consume meat.
She started practicing barefoot walking during some of our nature walks, claiming it helps her connect with the earth and nature. Initially, she ditched shoes occasionally, but now, it’s become a regular practice. She has been persuading me to join her in these barefoot walks and adopt a minimalist lifestyle.  On our last walk, she surprised me when she left her shoes at home, spending the entire day barefoot. She didn’t mind it at all when we went for a movie / meal after the walk and she appears to be enjoying this lifestyle, but I feel it may be a bit overboard. I don’t feel embarrassed by it, but I feel she may be trying too hard. 
I admire her dedication and the positive changes she’s experienced, but I’m worried she might be taking things too far. She has been a great friend and has supported me in many ways over the years, so I’m hesitant to confront her about my concerns.
I’m torn between respecting her lifestyle choices and addressing my discomfort. How should I approach this situation? Should I try to adapt to her new lifestyle, or is there a way to respectfully express my concerns? She seems to like this new lifestyle.

I am graduating next year and I have earned some money working part time. All I need is just 10k more to fully pay off my student fee loan. However my mother is really very selfish. 
Since the start of Covid I have been buying groceries for the whole family with my money from part time. My dad gives my mom a monthly allowance to settle household stuff. Basically she has zero output for these few years and a net gain of maybe close to 30k. 
I finally ask her to just give me 10k to settle the loan then I wouldn’t have to pay the damn interest rate. She went completely mad after I ask her that. She thinks that I am “after her money” and she told me that she doesn’t have any money to give me. When I try to explain I need only 10k I am not asking for all her life savings. She insisted that she has no money and I should stop pestering her for money that she doesn’t have. When I told her I have been spending a lot of my money on this household that’s why I am unable to pay, she completely just ignored me. 
I am really speechless. I feel that I have been serving her blindly, waking up early to go to the market and spending my hard earned money without hesitating. Naively thinking that my feelings are reciprocated and she will do the same for me. Boy am I wrong. I am okay with paying the interest but I don’t understand why she can’t just support me.

They are two disgusting piece of shit that look so unshaven and unclean, furthermore they threw me into my parents care when they couldn't afford to bring me up.

61199,108395,"With all due respect to OP of #108332 decades of experience in the engineering industry, I have to respectfully point out multiple flaws in his/her arguments lest undergrads reading that post get misled. As a NUS CS grad myself, I have a duty to rigorously defend my cohort.
While OP may be factually correct to say EE people can apply to CS jobs, this does not paint the full picture in practice. In my admittedly not so many decades of experience as a tech lead, most EE freshers I have interviewed do not code well to the standard required for most SWE roles. I checked out the EE syllabus and observe that the EE degree alone does not adequately prepare one to do an SWE role properly unless the graduate picks up additional skills on his own free time which I seen many do not do.
It's a fact that recent CS grads are top A-level scorers compared to EEs. Couple dumping ground A-levels with a largely irrelevant degree, it is no brainer that most EE graduates are also outclassed by low-tier CS graduates for SWE roles. With slight slowdown and layoffs in the tech industry, average EE freshers can simply forget about decent SWE jobs. With more CS grads in the job market, why should I bother to waste time looking at non-CS freshers?
OP claims that a CS graduate can never venture into EE roles. That is completely bogus and an unfair accusation into the learning capabilities of CS grads. A degree is a starting point of one's learning journey and it's incorrect to say that that all CS grads can do is be an SWE. There are plenty of online courses today where one can pick up skills after graduation. One is no longer limited to a university for learning.
Wasn't there a post not too long ago of a CS graduate who switched to embedded systems? This fact is a counterexample to OP's claim that electronics jobs are only accessible to EE grads. If a CS grad is crazily stupid enough, they can surely go for EE jobs too.
Suppose that a CS grad cannot work in electronics, PCB layout, ASIC, RF, optics, high-power systems, it is irrelevant as the EE industry in SG has all indications of being a sunset industry. This industry has passed its peak period, EE industry has shrunken due to jobs shifted to lower-cost areas, EE starting salaries have remained stagnant for years. How often do you see people taking up courses to career-switch into the electronics industry? More often than not, it is people from engineering that are switching to tech careers like data science and machine learning.
The CS degree is no less versatile than an EE degree and there are many roles in semicon, healthcare, energy, finance, robotics etc that value CS grads and even pay them more than the native engineers in those fields too.
Assuming OP's 33 years of industry experience is true, I am sorely disappointed. I expected him/her to give better advice to undergraduates than peddling outdated information and basking in his/her former glory of EE superiority.

But, even if I get into this course and acquire some A.I knowledge, I doubt there will be much ways for me to put what I have learnt into actual practice. A cert is as good as a toilet paper without actual industry experience. This places me in a huge dilemma.
Please kindly enlighten me and show me the way out.
I do not want to be left out for the next technological revolution. I am willing to run, not walk!

61203,108393,"Tldr: should i be concerned about my liquid diet?
(admins don’t block plsssss)
Ever since enrolling in NUS, i have gradually moved away from regular (solid) meals to a diet of mostly tea, coffee, milk and/or soft drinks.
I did that because whenever I have a heavy lunch/dinner, there will be a blood sugar spike and my brain will “fog” up for 2-3 hours, and I’m unable to concentrate in class and/or for my assignments. And it put my grades at risk.
However I found out that if I skipped those meals and just rely on drinks, I could continue studying for hours without feeling tired (and can absorb easily what I’m learning). 
I suspect this has to do with a more constant blood sugar level, even though I’ve not tested it. 
(Could be related to dopamine levels as well; I’m essentially coupling a more enjoyable/spontaneous activity with one that’s less)
After several semesters I’m used to this routine (especially when there are more assignments or nearing exams).  I can sit in UTown from like morning to evening, with 1-2 bottles of drinks by my side, and actually quite productively finish most of the work before I leave.
However many of my friends often pass by UTown and see me like this. (I’m still somewhat sensitive to their comments, and no I can’t study at home, and I can’t drink in libraries).  Some even made fun of my large appetite for drinks; others patiently counseled me that this can put me at risk of diabetes and other complications, which I might live to regret.
I have indeed become quite dependent on sugar-based drinks, and without them it is very difficult to maintain my focus and productivity. (Though I hope I would no longer be so reliant after graduation). 
However I have mostly maintained a healthy weight, eating 1-2 meals a day (usually only after I’m done with work or if they are less brain-intensive).
How worried should I be/ not be about this situation?
I feel like I finally found a “hack” to maintain good grades for my situation, and I don’t want to let go of it if I suddenly cut away sugar this semester!

61183,108350,"A SPR - glad to be stay as ‘only one’
This ain’t a post to put down anyone who chose to settle their life in any parts of the world.
Being a traveller, I have visited and lived in many countries. Singapore being one of the more memorable among many but I would like to share my thoughts of living in Singapore in and out as an expat and subsequently giving the SPR.
Back since 2005, I’ve been given the opportunity to travel and work around the world. I would consider myself quite fortunate to experience the world in person and I would not turn back time to give up any part of that. Those nostalgic moments made me who I am today and I’m glad for every trickle of it. 
I was offered a very attractive expatriate package back then to establish a ‘line of business’ in Singapore back in the mid 2000s and the incentives to relocate your business to Singapore was very appealing and in fact so appealing that by doing so, my LOB basically pays minimal corporate taxes throughout those years.
It was in fact one best decision to relocate to Singapore for work and life (back then) with one of the best healthcare in the world along with a government that knew what they were doing. Not to mention the unwavering focus on ‘marco-economics” that results in today’s strong currency.
To be frank, I did not regret being a SPR as there comes along with plenty of “perks” if you know what I meant but I wouldn’t give up my Australian citizenship for Singapore despite the perks I enjoyed here. 
As time goes by, I realised that there bits and pieces of Singapore that didn’t sit well with me in terms of social ethnics, declination of basic human decency and a climate that makes it increasingly tough to call this place liveable. No qualms this is still a place worth working however, I wouldn’t go to the extend of saying it’s an ideal place to live in anymore. 
From time to time, I would observe utterly poor social ethnicity such as “driving without a regard for other commuter’s safety, speaking loudly in public transportation, the lack of tolerance for one another despite living in the same estate. These are just a few examples that I could shed light on. Unfortunately, there are plenty more. 
There is saying, ‘whatever that is constant in life addressed short-lived benefits.’ This is especially true when it comes to the climate in Singapore. I know many people will say how fortunate it is to live in a place with no natural disaster. I would agree in an heart beat but as time goes by, I start to realise that the climate is partly the reason for gradual social aggression against one another. 
Another point that is worthy to mention is the over-burden of public infrastructure as the nation starts to materialise the 6 million population. Singapore used to be a fairly enjoyable place to live in back in the early 2000s, however I would beg to differ now.
There is also a strong emphasis on promoting Singapore as being the place to be and being number one in almost every aspect attainable and this is especially true when you observed the sort of news that is being shared in “The Straits Time” and CNA. I wouldn’t say that is necessary bad. However, over time, the locals created a perception to think that they are the ‘elites’ in the world and that has become rather detrimental for the nation as a whole in terms of ‘social values’.
Recently the DPM of Singapore introduces a movement called the ‘Forward Singapore’ which covers aspects of what Singapore will be like down the next 50 years. To be frank, I would suggest folks who chose to live here to start cultivating a basic social ‘norm’ or behaviour that respects one another cause without ‘respect’, there is no amount of money that could buy you happiness’ 
Over the years, i spoke to many locals to understand if they are truly happy living here but often the response is ‘not unhappy but neither happy’  - The feeling of stuck in neutral and often it will lead to being unhappy as one ages. I guess that plays a part in the current context of ‘society degradation’.
Ultimately, I guess it is what it is or what the locals would say as “L L” in their lingo. I’m simply thankful for having the option to choose where I want to live.
Stay happy and live a better life.

61217,108412,"Hello, I’m the OP of #108353. Thanks for sharing your thoughts on my situation! Now I better understand on many possible reasons why my mum disagreed to the arrangement although I personally feel that certain things like neighbour’s judgement don’t really matter to me because we don’t even talk to them. Maybe relatives if they even know about it, but its not important to me though. Perhaps parents are mindful about it?
From my POV, it will be whereby he stays over maybe once or max twice in a month or two? Not permanent arrangement until we get married. It is merely because I find it an easier arrangement sometimes for both of our schedules and he don’t have to travel all the way back home when its already late, and not denying I like that we get to spend more time together. I personally enjoy times when he’s with me even when he’s doing his own things or even when he’s taking a nap lol. Anyone feels the same as me??
Don’t even consider about naughty things, that’s not the point to me for this issue, although I acknowledge from your inputs that it might be one of my mum’s concern.
No choice, abide by house rules lo. Thanks for reading btw. 
Anyway, i’m just curious if anybody has to share about your parents allowing your partner to stay over before marriage? (or if you are a parent, why would you allow this?)

61221,108452,"Hi everyone,
I am in a situation and would appreciate your advice. 
Recently, I noticed the presentation layout which I created for a module submission last month in my part-time program bears a striking resemblance to the one my lecturer (A) used for a promotional course last week, which happens to be the institution’s first of its kind.
I suspect my module lecturer (B) forwarded my slides to the lecturer (A), given their shared teaching responsibilities in the same program. 
The similarity is especially notable as my design layout originated from my organization's specific marketing approach, and I was the creator behind it. While lecturer (A)'s presentation layout shares similarities, except for its content, her design falls short, which is understandable as she is not a professional designer.
Complicating matters, lecturer (A) is also the marker for one of my modules this semester, and I'm uncertain about the best approach. 
Should I address the similarity with her now, or after the exam papers have been marked? Should I also inform the program leader regarding this presentation layout issue? Or should I just let the matter go, considering the valuable information lecturer (A) has shared about the modules?
Additionally, I've sensed a change in lecturer (A)'s behaviour towards me since Semester 2. In Semester 1, everything went smoothly, but during Semester 2, even though she didn't teach me, I attended her makeup class and noticed a notable shift in her demeanour – she seemed detached, cold, and strict.
My goal is to ensure fairness in the assessment process and maintain a professional relationship with the lecturer (A). If anyone has encountered a similar situation or has thoughts on how to manage this, I would greatly appreciate your insights.
Thanks in advance!

61211,108399,"Intrusive thoughts and how to cope with them
I am and have been coping with very intrusive thoughts for a very long time now and I'm hoping to find a solution before things escalate out of hands. Unfortunately, therapy is out of question due to reasons I will point out in this post.
I am in my late 20s and come from a rather privileged background - I have been working for my father in an investment firm. While my job is quite stressful, I have several sources of resources that make my life quite manageable. Unfortunately, I was raised in an environment where money, status, and, image matters above everything. To some extent, this upbringing has moulded me to be who I am today - I am not faulting my upbringing completely but it is not entirely faultless.
I live in my own apartment that was paid for by my family when I suggested that living together in the family house was getting to suppressing and I needed my own space. I have a PA that does most of the leg work and procurement of things I need, things I do, and places I go to. I take good care of my health and don't drink or smoke - much to the chagrin of my pals. I am attached with a girlfriend but she doesn't seem to bring much joy or purpose in my life, we meet twice a week and do regular couple stuff. She is a little upset that I don't ask her to move in with me but I have laid the ground rules very early on in our relationship that my private sanctum is absolutely crucial to me. Our sex life is nothing to write home about, I usually go through the motions as I find it void of passion and it doesn't terribly bring excitement.
What brings excitement and joy to me are my intrusive thoughts and some of which i regularly give in to and act upon. I find extreme pleasure in dominance and deliverance of pain, and I exercise this in the form of paid escorts. There are services that I can do with next to no need of holding back and I can, to put in crudely, do anything I want to these women and men. I am able to slap, choke, and basically deliver pain with consent and my orgasms are extremely gratifying. I am never able to feel such pleasures with my girlfriend and this was my personal brand of heroin for some time.
After a while, it started to wane as I somehow realised that it was staged to some extent and I'm just lying to myself that I am in control. Not long after, I found a new addiction - drawing blood from strangers. I was invited to play football and basketball by an acquaintance of mine - I would normally never partake in such activities as it involved getting physical with commoners( I apologise for this - I was brought up not fraternise with the common folks). However, I need a specific watch which I am unable to purchase and this wankstain guy has it - I needed to entertain him to get him to sell it to me. It was then when I realised I could essentially 'accidentally' elbow a guy right in his nose drawing blood! I would simply offer to pay his medical bills which was usually a mere couple of hundreds - bloody amazing!
I had to rotate between different groups of different sports to not draw attention but I am pretty good at it I believe. After doing so, I would meet my girlfriend or an escort and it would be a heavenly sexual experience. It has been my addiction for a while now.
I have other intrusive thoughts such as wondering how would the 'cocky finance bros who laughably think their Rolexes and Beemers elevate their standing' would feel if I were to bend them over and brutally destroy them from behind, making them feel like they are being broken in half. At times, I get annoyed by the geriatric employees who seem to be extremely backward in their thinking and traditional beliefs. I have intrusive thoughts that make me wonder if they would expire if I am able to deliver a punch to their sternum.
I am worried that these intrusive thoughts take over me and get me into depths of hell that I will never be able to get out of.
I acknowledge I am addicted to pain and suffering but I know, on some levels, this is not right. How do I address this? If knowledge of visiting a therapist in make known to my family or social circle, my life is essentially over.

61196,108374,"Underinsured for insurance? Looking for investing options for midterm too.(3-5 years)
I have just started working in my current company since May. It has a group term life, group personal accident, hospitalisation insurance coverage for all full time employees that you can choose how much to cover from 12x to 48x of your monthly salary. With me being cheapskate and wanting to claim more on flexible benefits, I opted to downgrade from the default 24x monthly salary to 12x monthly salary coverage for term life insurance so that I can get an additional $200+ in flexible benefits that I can claim for items such as dental treatment, spectacles, medical checkup etc. I am thinking if I should continue like this for the next year and so on.
Currently I am paying $500++ in total yearly for a Great Eastern term life and hospitalisation insurance covering death, total and permanent disability, hospitalisation and surgical coverage. I am in the lookout for something that is much cheaper that I am currently paying right now as the term insurance has a coverage of $200k but I am thinking to downgrade to something cheaper like FWD insurance which has a term life policy of paying $13.70 for $100k coverage till 70. Funny thing is right I can afford to have a higher coverage with my current pay but I don't want to increase my coverage and want to stick to what I am having now. Probably because my father used to tell me that insurance is a waste of money so that idea stuck with me till now ?
My current take home pay is ~$3700 after CPF deduction, after giving my parents $1000 allowance I would invest $2000 into a ETF that I am investing for long term. In addition I would also park $1000 into various 6 months and 1 year T-bills and fixed deposits so I am looking at something that can cover me for the next 3-5 years.

61172,108333,"Dear love, a few months after I started work in this company, I started to have feelings for you and the feelings grow as time goes by. You were everything, if not more, than what I would ever ask for in a partner. To me, you are a ""one in a million"" -- it's the simple gestures like saying ""thank you"", or being a gentleman most of the time is what I really love about you.  I value little gestures; it's the thought that counts. You made realize that a person with a good EQ doesn't have to be a bullshitter. You are wise with your words, and the way you say things. However, not long after, a trusted and reliable source told me that you had never wanted a relationship with me and that we were just colleagues. I was heartbroken. It was my first actual heartbreak and you had taught me what a heartbreak feels like. I couldn't come to terms with why you didn't want to be with me. I told myself that maybe you had inadvertently led me on.
I understand that a handful of those around us realize that there is something between us. When being asked whether I am aware of your relationship status ie, whether you are single, or attached, I quickly brush it off and say ""he is such a good guy I am sure he is attached"" but deep in my heart I know that the statement is an immature one. I value you in the team. I realize that I look up to you, amongst other things. 
As time goes by, I realize I still love you, albeit not as much as I used to after what the source said. However, a few days back I had a dream that I had known you from my past life; I know your race, your gender (you were a female then) and that we were close friends. You are my soulmate, but why can't we be together? Why don't you love me? That might explain why I love your aura, your energy, and why I felt a kind of connection with you. The thought of ""us"" lingers in my mind after the dream. When I saw you walking past my desk it felt nice to have the upper hand of knowing who you were in your past life and that we had known each then. Now, we are two different individuals and I feel that we have probably reached a point of no return -- notwithstanding the fact that you might or might not be attached, you believe that I am attached and my partner is a caucasian. Has it ever come to your mind that he is my father? I studied in the UK since high school and you are aware of that. When my job was on the rocks, I was upset and I wanted to make my desk more ""homely"". So, I decorated my workspace with pictures of home ie. my family members. I have a Chinese surname, am not a local, and my surname follows that of my mother. My dad is a Caucasian and spent most of his time in the UK. I honestly feel that we have reached a point of no return. Even though the person said you never wanted to have a relationship with me, I had a gut feeling that you hated the picture of my father. 
I feel that we have reached a point of no return. Ie. that you thought I was attached and you/we have given up on each other.  On my end, the deal breaker was what the source (a tarot reader) had said, and to you (if you ever had feelings for me), it's probably the fact that you had thought I was attached. As a result, you were less friendly than you were before. Understand that if I were to approach you and clear things up, you would (like all humans do) protect yourself/ act cool/ or not understand a thing I was saying. If I were to approach you and tell you that I had a dream that you were my soulmate, I might be a ""weirdo"" to you, and that might keep us further apart. Tbh, I feel we were closer then, during the first few months in the company.  I can't put myself in a difficult position of letting you know that you are my soulmate.
I love you, but I can't put myself in a position to let you know how I feel. I am grateful to know that I had known you in my previous life; we were friends then, and I hope I am a friend to you, in this life. I don't know when you will forget about me as humans do when we grow older or lose touch, but if that is the case, I hope to meet you again in our next life cycle.
