60534,106967,"Exactly 1 year ago, I wrote a confession here. I shared about dating a guy who earned so much less than me, and I had concerns with that. At that time in the comment section, I got bashed a lot.
Anyway I took the feedback, I went ahead and agreed to be his gf. Today, we have broken up for 4 months. The reason for breaking is (again) because he earned too little, and therefore his mindset was too different from mine when it comes to financial goals and spending. I also find it was too hard to feel happy when I had to keep hearing him complaining about paying for dates (to clarify, most of the time we split 50/50, sometimes I treated him but when it was his turn, the complaints came out). On top of this, with a humble financial background also comes very uneducated behaviors (for example, being mean to family members or cruel to animals). Not saying it is the case for all who earns less, just saying it’s a common risk.
Hence, for those girls who feel alright dating down, good for you. I can’t. I’m not demanding to be treated like princess here. Thinking back on how I was bashed and advised to not be materialistic 1 year ago, I just feel bitter. How women are often looked down on even for asking for just a little bit of fairness in relationships.
Recently, I’ve started dating someone who earns more. It feels good that he is classy and willingly picks up the bill most of the time (although I still insist to pay for some to maintain 50/50). So I’m not in for materialism but pointing out the financial capabilities speak something.

60515,106933,"My advice to guys thinking of settling down and getting married - don't! You will regret it.
I too once thought I found the love of my life. That we will live happily ever after. I was so in love all the advice I've heard before fell on deaf ears. Don't repeat my mistakes!
Someone once told me that the biggest reason marriages fail is because women think that men will change after marriages but they don't. Men think that women wouldn't change, but they do.
And boy do they change... Within a few years, I can barely remember the woman I loved. And I'm not just talking appearance - it's the personality changes that scare me. Even her family commented that she is so different.
The once caring, gentle girl who was the light of my life is now my nightmare. Everything I do or don't do is wrong. Everything I say or don't say is wrong. Every wrong step she will dig up things from ages ago and stack them up.
Other than the 3 kids we have and love dearly, we are worse than roommates. Every time I thought we made progress, something trivial will trigger her and it's worse than ever.
So think twice, thrice, and 100 times before you jump the gun.

60484,106878,"Hello,
NUS SoC alumni here. TL;DR started a startup, declined an acquisition offer last year and the business is growing. This is not about the startup, this is a tribute to my parents.
When we decided to not get acquired last year at the last minute, we had run out of money. It was a gut decision and we did not have backup options for fundraise. I felt it was right and my parents supported me. My dad said I should not think about anything below $100Mn.
Since we were not profitable and I was hearing NOs from investors, I was worried about how to pay salaries. My parents stepped in and gave me some cash which helped support the team. All this while, they have been paying my living expenses (I stopped taking salary of course). They paid me to fly in the region to meet customers.
I had a dispute with my flatmate and they paid for my rental when he decided to make me pay for renovation etc. upfront. They told me to stand up for myself and not get bullied. They transferred me the money and got one of their friends to bring some cash for me next week to help with living expenses.
My brother is in SF and works for FAANG, so all my groceries and grab are on his card. My parents would not let him pay for my rent etc. and he is free to live his life. He lives in a luxury apartment with a cat and does not have to worry. He can spend all his time and focus on his work.
The thing is that my mom is a housewife and my dad is a salaried employee in a developing country. They already used some of the savings to get me to NUS. I had a full scholarship at NTU but I really wanted to go to NOC, so they let me go to NUS. I never could qualify for NOC (rejected 4 times) and my parents never mentioned it once. My dad stayed with me for 15 days when I first came to Singapore thirteen years ago because I was only 15 and made sure everything was okay.
They supported me in continuing to live out my entrepreneurial dream. I got slightly disillusioned in between and gave some interviews to FAANG and had one very good offer. When I shared this with them, they would just tell me to do what I want. And I could not convince myself to take up a job because it would prevent me from having a shot at being somebody who history remembers.
I did not know earlier but know now that they actually sold off their property and took loans to pay for me. I would never have known had I not chanced upon the opened post on our dining room table while I was home. I have no idea what I did in my last life to deserve such parents. I do not. And I do not know what the future will be. We are profitable and growing now but I still do not take a salary. We have a lead investor etc. and I likely will be able to pay myself a little bit in the coming months.
I am not sure if I will ever be able to repay them. I screwed up so many times in university life and even while doing the startup - slacking off, doing random things like picking up chess, not showing up to meetings on time etc.. They would scold me a little for all of this but would never ever tell me money is a problem. I never had that burden and if I knew about what they have done, I would have taken up a job. My mom always asks me if I am eating and exercising right, never about how much I am spending.
If you see someone trying to be successful on their own, don't just think of their work or preseverance. The real MVPs might be their parents. They would never get the glory. And they would never ask for something in return. I love my mom and dad so much, and I will still be pulling their leg or not calling them. They would not want me to know and that is how it shall be.

Honestly, the only saving grace is the guaranteed promotion annually if you don't fuck up.
But is it worth it? Because factor that in, the pay is still miserable and the hours are still shitty. So why join Big 4 for the guaranteed promotion?
Not to mention:
The pay is low, and the hours are long. You have to work on weekends, be it whether you are forced by the manager/partner, or that you are so afraid that you cannot complete your work on time because of the ridiculous deadline with the growing shortage of staff that you turn your computer on to catch up on saturdays/sundays. I had worked 14 hours a day for 6-7 days a week for the last 6 months.
You will have no time for your family and friends. You will have to miss gatherings.
You will suffer badly from a lack of sleep. Your health will deteriorate. Your temper will grow and you will become impatient as well.

Here’s a little background about myself and my family:
We are a family of 4 and earn just enough to not qualify for any financial aid, however we are also in debt.
My sibling and i are matriculating into nus this year.
I have watched my parents work so hard to bring the both of us up and I am very grateful for that. Recently, I decided to find out how much does it take to raise a child in Singapore and after factoring my parents’ income and the cost of living in Singapore, i was devastated. We literally scrapped through every month with little to no savings. I feel like such a burden to my parents, stopping them from living their lives. They were really living just to support me and my sister.
Now having found a full time job whilst waiting for my matriculation, I’m really glad that I’m able to give my parents allowance to make up for their support while bringing us up. However i am worried that they will be pressured when i have to quit working and start studying this coming August.
Hence i feel that if a couple can’t afford to have children, they shouldn’t have kids. When the child finds out about how hard their parents have to work to bring them up, it really takes a toll on their mental health.

Might I be attracting a certain sort of woman and why?

My exes did not want children for fear of damaging their figure.
I am not opposed to not having children but my status quo is want to have children as I like them and that is also the usual path in life. I understand the benefits of not having children but I am not completely convinced.

60480,106870,"Should I break up with him?
I have changed the story substantially to protect my identity but the advice will apply to my situation.
I met a guy during my first year. He was in his first year of medical school and I was in my first year of accounting. We hit it off right away. We shared similar tastes in food, in movies, in hobbies, we even took the same third-lang in secondary school. We've been dating for more than 8 years now. We don't fight, we always spend time together. Everything is better than I have ever imagined when it's just the two of us.
Recently we've been talking about marriage. It would have been a no-brainer for me to marry him were it not for this weird philosophy that he has about our responsibilities as spouses. He believes strongly that he is marrying me and not my family and likewise I am marrying him and not his family. According to him, I will be exempted of all my obligations to his family if I so want to be, and he should be given the same privilege. This, apparently, isn't just his idea. His whole family thinks this way, even his parents. His mom sat me down once to tell me that while I am always welcome, I will not be expected to do anything and she hopes I don't expect her son to do the same. One detail. Both his parents are doctors and they own and run a specialist clinic together. My dad is a taxi driver and my mom is a homemaker.
My mom and dad have been giving me pressure to soldier on with the marriage and they have indicated to me that they plan to ask for an obscene 5-figure amount in dowry and more than half of the banquet seats. His parents have also spoken to me and they said they will not be participating in any tradition, and all costs for the marriage will be borne 50/50. It's probably worth noting that my boyfriend's family do not celebrate any festivals (not Christmas, not CNY) and they are passionate atheists. I am pretty indifferent about my family's traditions but I don't know if I'm willing to get into a fight with my parents over what will come across as blatant disrespect. I also feel uneasy that my boyfriend does not believe in helping out with my duties to my family. One reason I want to marry is the fact that there are many challenges in life that are just easier to take on with help, most of these challenges involve my responsibilities to my family. I have a brother who is unfortunately autistic, and another brother who has a juvenile record and recently got a baby but refuses to work. He had this baby with a girl out of wedlock and now all of them are living in my parents' three-bedroom apartment. Most of the money I earn helps pay for all the problems that keep happening in my family. I don't like that I can't catch a break either. But it doesn't feel right to renegade on my family even when they are clearly suffocating.
I was fortunate enough to have had financial aid through the very elite schools that I grew up in. My friends are all from upper middle class families and I have spoken to them. Apparently they were quite uniform in their inability to support me on this issue because they also believe that it would be difficult for them to want to marry someone if they didn't first have assurances that their lives wouldn't be made more difficult post-marriage. In other words, most of them took the side of my boyfriend.
Am I the weird one to be expecting my future husband to share my burdens, however heavy they are? If I go through with this, I'm afraid of how ugly things can get with my boyfriend's family being of a completely different culture to mine. But if I do not, I don't know there is a guy out there that exists that I get along with while still being willing to support me.

60483,106875,"First of all, context. Family is very well-to-do. Mom doesn’t work (though she has a law degree) but dad ran his own law firm for 30 years, recently retired.
This is an issue with parents not paying for my wedding.
Mom doesn’t get involved in things. Dad has refused to speak to my girlfriend since we started dating and it’s all because my girlfriend is a Chinese-speaking, practicing Taoist from a poor family in Malaysia, and a vegetarian.
My dad is a banana. Doesn’t speak Chinese at all, read law at Cambridge (PSC scholar), freethinker. Doesn’t think I should marry this girl because she has a large low-income family and an even larger low-income extended family and he thinks I am getting myself into a lot of trouble by marrying her. My girlfriend doesn’t know English very well, so she prefers to speak Mandarin with a heavy Malaysian accent. She’s from a small town in Malaysia. She came to Singapore to work but her family are all still back in Kedah. She goes back often. I’ve been there a couple of times.
My girlfriend requested if we could have two banquets, one in Singapore and one for her extended family and friends back in her hometown. My dad told me if I had chosen to marry a middle-class Singapore girl from an English-speaking family he would’ve paid for everything. He would have also bought us a condo and a car. But since I have decided to marry this girl, which to him isn’t a very smart thing to do, he will not pay for anything.
My older brother married his JC sweetheart from Hwa Chong and my dad literally paid for a Fullerton Hotel banquet, an entry level Lexus, and they are in the process of looking for a condo, will also be paid for by my dad. Besides the point.
I don’t have money right now for a wedding, let alone 2. My fiancé said that the wedding in Malaysia is a must, and my parents have to go to Kedah for a bride price negotiation ritual that my dad has categorically refused to participate. Called it idiotic. My mom has also called it “incredibly stupid” and refused to come with me to Malaysia without my dad. My fiancé’s parents said they wouldn’t agree to the marriage if all of these formalities are not done. My fiancé is powerless. She has a rather meek personality.
My fiancé doesn’t want to register our marriage before these formalities are done because she feels she needs her parents’ blessing or else she wouldn’t be able to face her family. Wants me to find a way to convince my parents to participate. My dad has repeatedly used the phrase “third-world bullshit” and I don’t think he’s ever coming around. One way is to convince my mom to do it alone but she’s as much of a banana as my dad is and she also hates tradition.
I feel stuck because my fiancé’s wants her parents’ blessing, her parents will only give us their blessing if my parents participate in the rituals and come to an agreement, but my parents do not agree to my marrying this girl in the first place. Even if this first part is done, I still have no money for a banquet.

60498,106908,"TL;DR Became a doctor for the wrong reasons, feeling disillusioned
I used to do relatively well in school, so when the time came to choose a course, medicine was a natural decision for me. Natural not because of some gravitation towards helping people or other noble desires, but rather it was more of just a question of studying the best course available to me at the time. I guess it was partly ambition. With many friends and family members scrutinising my every achievement, I needed to show that I could do it, I could make it, I could be somebody and have a nice title to prove it.
As I progressed in my studies, it became increasingly apparent that many aspects of the field just did not appeal to me. Often I just faked interest to blend in but did the bare minimum in the things I hated just to get it over with. I found myself repeatedly questioning myself about my decision to go into medicine, if I'm really cut out for this etc. (Though after speaking to some close doctor friends, I realised I wasn't the only one who harboured such thoughts.) Nevertheless, I pulled through with my studies because I had already sacrificed too much to consider changing courses.
Now here I am, a clinician who hates clinical practice, who loathes having to stick things up people's butts and pretend it's normal, who dislikes doing any kind of procedure on a patient actually. It's not that I don't care about them - I do want someone to help them, I just don't want to be the one doing it. Some patients are nice and I can suppress my dislike a little bit better, but when a patient is rude or demanding, I would have no qualms about telling them to f*k right off. (Not in those words exactly, but just enough to not be held accountable for it) I mean there are plus sides too for sure, I don't have to worry too much about cash, job security is rock solid, I get substantial attention from girls, people respect me for what I do, and the field is dynamic so it never gets boring.
All things considered, I don't know if I'm being unreasonable to think about switching careers, especially after having spent so much time and effort in medicine. But I mean what else could I do? I don't particularly like research, and none of the clinical fields I have encountered thus far appeal to me either...

My gf on the other hand, will feel jealous and sulk when she mentions so and so just went to where and where. Like we are planning to see cherry blossoms this year. She is ok with that but asked if we can visit somewhere further year end. I know she has friends who can go on multiple trips in a year. But we only budget for one trip this year. I'm not saying year end I won't be planning anything but its likely we will not travel out for December.
She also told me her friends rents branded clothes and bags and asks me to sponsor her as a bday gift as she wants to try. I don't see the point. Its money spent but end of the day you own nothing. Only memories of the things worn if you had photos taken? I would rather we have a nice dinner and watch a concert.
She's starting to act like I should be more supportive of her wanting to match up to her materialistic friends which I don't think there is a need to. Both of us are earning a decent wage for our age but I think we are more on the thrifty kind of lifestyle. She does own a few nice and fancy items which I find it ok to treat ourselves once in a while. I just don't see the need to rent branded items and clothes.

60525,106955,"Everyday I wake up and think, man I love Computer Science. I can’t wait to learn more about CS!
Studying CS has actually helped me improve my EQ. CS2030 taught me the notion of covariance and contravariance. A little further digging into the theory taught me that, property of an object can be studied by examining how other objects interact with it, such as by passing it into programs, and also by studying the inheritance structure of the classes that the object came from. Similarly, thinking processes of a people can be studied by examining how they with other people, and examining their performance in routines. These routines can be exams, group projects, internships, jobs, or anything really. We can also study their inheritance structures: In the case of studying people, it will be the environment that they grew up in that produced them, and how these environments changed over time. It could be their friends, family, schools attended, interest groups… anything that they interact or have interacted with on a regular basis.
Gaining EQ is like Dynamic Programming. Just store (memorize) the solution to previous subcases (past human interactions) and then find the DP relation to the next case (future human interaction). Of course, different problems will have different solutions and different DP relations. Moving from one DP problem to the next is akin to moving from one social structure to the next. There will be a different culture (DP relation) to get used to, and it can be uncovered by studying and memorizing a few instances of example interactions, (subcases) possibly between 2 other people not including myself, and then generalizing.
Complexity Theory was especially interesting. Interactive and Zero Knowledge Proofs taught me to think clearer about information being revealed in daily conversations. This helps prevent accidental self-doxxing online. It also helps in constructing politically correct, non-answers when faced with sticky and awkward questions. When studying derandomization techniques, I found out that most researchers today believe that BPP = P, meaning that all problems solvable by an efficient random algorithm also has an efficient deterministic algorithm as a solution. Extending this to observing people, I feel that the many seemingly random choices many people make are actually part of some principles that they live by.

60506,106924,"Currently a student in Finance, working in a MNC.
I have been holding this annoyance for a while and wish to get it off my chest and gain some opinions. I felt that I was wrongly blamed.
I have recently joined a new company and I’m the youngest. My team consist of about 8 of us and most of them are in their mid 30s.
2 weeks ago I was tasked to choose a place for our team lunch. It is a tradition where the youngest usually is the one choosing the place. I was given less than a day to think.
It is known that there are quite a few factors to consider:
1. There are 3 lacto-vegetarians in my team. As such, the restaurants need to have vegetarian options.
2. We worked at Buona Vista and our lunch need to be quick as we have important work to finish. This also means it needs to be nearby. For dinner, there must be additional of alcohol as we have heavy drinkers in the team.
3. The ambience must be pleasant and nice. No coffee shop, no rundown places.
4. They want a generally expensive place. (It is known as they are quite well-to-do individuals). They won’t settle for coffeeshop. FYI, our first team dinner when I joined the company was for 8 pax at Artemis and we spend close to $2000 for it. The company paid for it.
I tried finding around Holland Village for a restaurant with vegetarian options as it is fairly close-by and there are a few restaurants there. I found this western and Italian place with vegetarian options and suggested it to my director. Him being a vegetarian himself looked through the menu and agree to it saying “There are quite a lot of vegetarian options and ambience is okay.” I gave the menu and restaurant name to the rest of my team and they all looked through it. Pizza, pasta and some tapas are the vegetarian options.
Fast forward: After we had our lunch at the place, I overheard another director (he) and colleague (she) talking bad and laughing about the place, saying “Pizza and bread for lunch?! Hahaha.”
Shortly after I conversed with them and came to know that they don’t see pizza as a proper food item, but rather a side dish. There was no direct confrontation but just some sourness during the conversation.
I was fairly offended after. There was no direct confrontation but it still left me quite confused and angry.
For myself, I didn’t come from a very well-to-do family and I’m okay with pizza for lunch. I wouldn’t even mind going to a coffeeshop and just have noodles and rice.
My family don’t have a high status in society, just an average Singaporean. The most expensive food meal I ever have and paid myself is probably just kbbq that cost around $30+.
This is why I went an extra mile to provide them with the menu to see if they are okay with the food but the result wasn’t what I expected. There were no direct objections at the start and I thought they are totally fine with it. After getting negative gossips behind my back over this makes me feel upset.
What do you think? If it is you, would you be upset?

And I'm feeling really stressed. Not just because the final exams are coming soon (just over a month later in the first week of May), but also because I find that with so much time spent on studying, there's not much left for things like exercise, my previous hobbies like netball, and dating. So sick and tired of medicine.
Don't wanna use dating apps because of the stigma. It's a last-resort as I have heard horror stories from that. Pretty sure I can meet guys irl first?
Currently single (for 2+ years) ever since I broke up with my first bf from JC, and keen on dating. What do you all think of the idea of dating a batchmate from my cohort? I feel like with dating a batchmate, since we'd have a lot in common and we can probably relate a lot to each other. But I don't know anyone else apart from my CG (clinical group).
I have a secret fantasy about dating an older guy too, so, hmm... I imagine that most of the guys in my batch are my age cos of army disruption, but I think that there should be a few who had completed NS first. There're also some who transferred in right?
Too bad I'm not chio la. Just a 5/10 (prob 6.5/10 with good makeup) plain Jane, and never had a guy confess enthusiastically to me before. If only there were a way for me to meet more my batchmates... I secretly want a cute oppa batchmate to confess to me hehehehe

I hate this line ""please lower your expectations"".
I only have one question to everyone, ""How do I get into the same league or a better league than great girls?"".
What should I work on?
What makes someone attractive despite their disadvantages?
Please share some actionable steps.
If you believe that I should just look for someone within the same league or that I cannot improve myself, then I think you should not read further.
Here is a little background about me:
I am kind of on the lower end for looks because of a specific health condition.
I also have a background which is a little disadvantageous and people constantly look down me.
These are issues I have no control over.
I don't want to lose out because of things that are not in my control.
This is not even my fault.
No one, from my friends to relatives, believe that I can get someone good in my life.
Here are things I am already trying to do:
I am already going to gym to get into shape. Due to an injury in army, I cannot get into an ideal physique but I try to get as close as I can.
I am working in an average but meaningful job. I have worked extremely hard and have made some achievements there, even been featured .
I have also worked on my social skills (reading books, watching videos) by trying to be more funny and actively listening to people to have more meaningful and deeper conversations.
Despite all my effort thus far, I am still not going any further.
Dating apps are brutal because they are 80% based on looks (no matter what I write on my profile) so I get practically no matches.
I have tried physical dating events and have had some slight success. The girls say that they enjoy the conversations with me but they don't want to be romantic partners. Some even offered to be friends.
I have no idea where I am screwing things up. Things seem to keep repeating.
I am still in a league below them. I am not sure how to climb up further.
If you have any tips, please do share.
Thanks!!!

I do plan to get married in the future, but I'm not currently dating, and at the rate that I'm going I'm probably going to be single for a while, 'cos I'm just constantly doing internships and studying so I don't actively meet anyone.
So, my parents divorced when I was 1yo, and never really had much contact with my father. Due to certain reasons, my mom lost the matrimonial home and we've been staying in a rental, 1-bedroom HDB for a few years now. (I have an elder sister but she has married out so she's kinda out of the picture)
I have thought of renting a place when I graduate but I don't feel good about spending close to 1000 a month on rent, but yet I can't seem to be satisfied with sleeping in the living room for the next few years. And hence I've thought about this. (My earning potential is around 5k-6k/mth as a fresh grad, and hence the downpayment amt isn't really a concern as long as I have 1 or 2 years.)
But then this does still raise a few concerns, right? For the ladies, would you be okay with settling down with someone like me, knowing well that you won't be able to do the conventional BTO, or maybe even the fact that you might have to live with your mother-in-law?

But he says he's unsure and also worried that he will hurt me. And he says he don't want to be possessive too. Someone told me that if the guy really loves you, he wouldn't want you to date another person.
What are your thoughts and perspectives? Should I move on and focus my energy and time on another potential?

60466,106830,"Asking for advice:
I've recently met someone through an interest group, we went out few times, I enjoy his company and have some very different feelings with him that I've never experienced.
We have very similar hobbies. However, I started to realize we have different life goal and as well as background, it'll be really hard if we are going to build our future life.
Am I being too realistic for thinking to put a stop now before our relationship grow deeper and hurt each other ultimately ? Am I thinking too far ahead? Or is it unfair for him if I still continue to hang out with him?

My recent coping mechanism is to think of my neighbour, who goes by the name of Amos Yee. Yes, the one who yeeted his chance at escaping Singapore for good by liking children a bit too much, and will be behind bars in many places for the forseeable future.
Get a D for Data Structures and Algorithms? There are worse D's he will be faving
Get a CU in Singapore: Imagining the Next 50 Years? I don't mind seeing you again, GES1035. Can't say the same for him and his prisonmates.
Get an F for Honours Thesis? There are worse F's for him than me getting this one.

60500,106915,"I wanted to add on to #106812 about fretting if a course is above one’s station. I know people doing computer science (CS) / pharmaceutical science (PHS) / Aerospace because they did well for A-Levels and chose to “upgrade” from whatever course that they wanted, only to regret later or even change course. To add insult to injury, those that stuck on may not get the high pay that they thought they would get.
Don’t be too hung up by the “prestige” or the IGP, focus on what you’re good at and what you love and. All the best!

Snakes are a part of the world, and as such it is impossible to be completely rid of them unless you fortify yourself inside a solid bubble. The best you can do is keep your snake interactions at a minimum and keep any snakes as exposed as possible. Taking away the animal’s sense of security is part of the battle.
Next, how to trap snakes with a glue trap. Traps should be placed at vantage positions around the snake’s territory. Lure the snake inside through a specially designed opening. Once inside, the glue holds it firmly in place. What you do after is up to your own ethics. The downside is that you risk getting bitten.
So what would you do: avoid, expose or trap?

I’ve sleep typed to my ex multiple times. I would send something kind and loving when I’m really tired and then I’ll doze off for a while in which I’ll have a short dream about how he either replied me (obviously doesn’t happen irl) or my message. This will jolt me awake and I’ll question if I have sent it and realise I did. This happens periodically when I’m so tired. Don’t think it warrants a block because I do feel a lot for him and only want the best so all the things I’ve typed subconsciously mean well. Ah tiredness is a no no.
If you’re reading this, love you lots. Sorry for the spam, though I mean what I said!

Thank you for the kind words and encouragement. I feel I am in a better place after going through the constant transitions over the past few months. Many things have happened in my life. I lost some and gained some. It was a tough transition, as whatever had happened made me realize that I lost myself in the process while trying to chase or care for things or people that would somehow be only a phase in my life.
Some nights, I find myself tearing up to sleep or dazing while commuting to work and even at my work desk. I started feeling inadequate in every aspect of my life and felt that I had lost my self-worth. I had no one to talk to, and all I could do was look at inspirational videos or poems to pull me through. It took me a long time to regain my footing and finally start placing more focus on work.
I have no idea what is going on in your life now, but if you ever feel like you need to feel better, this is what I do: write three things about what you are grateful for at the start of the day, three things that you thought that you did well at the end of the day and three things you think you could improve on. Penning these thoughts has helped me look at things on the brighter side and reflect on my actions and thoughts. It also taught me the virtue of patience -i.e., sometimes, we can be mad and tend to be reactive fast. Instead, it enables me to reflect on my thoughts before acting in a way I would regret. If you feel like you need someone to talk to, I am always open for conversation to offer you a listening ear. As for advice, I think you are wiser than me haha.
Nevertheless, looking back, I would not blame anyone for whatever happened because I believe life has its way of teaching us lessons to grow us into a stronger, better version of ourselves. As you mentioned- tough times don't last; tough men do. Actually, this is one of my favorite quotes, when things get hard, to remind myself that if I could do it in the past, there's nothing to stop me from pulling it through now. Though I may no longer be as close to you as we used to be, I will still be happy and rooting for your future success.
P.s. Congrats on working through your uni phase and settling it through your saving and trading. I know there's no better feeling to achieve that sense of independence and fulfilment in the world. Jia you bah :)
