After 6 months of dating, realizing that his height is actually 162cm instead of 172cm due to the insoles that he never failed to wear on every date, and now the both of you around same height, with you being 1-2cm taller.

60805,107585,"Is it a sampling issue or are people from not-so-wealthy families more spendthrift, tend to engage in a lot more hedonistic activities, and are much more arrogant than people from generationally wealthy families?
I have dated a total of 4 guys.
One was from a ultra-high net worth family. He was my first. I dated him the longest. His parents own one of the most famous food product companies in Southeast Asia. I met him at a friend's wedding. He had just come back from the US, graduated from Penn, in-line to take over the business as the oldest child. Due to differences in goals (he doesn't want kids period), we felt it was better if we parted ways. Apart from the kid issue, I would have married him.
He was an intense individual, very ambitious, very energetic, very calculating, very forward-looking, very pragmatic. He was also modest and thrifty. He loves eating at hawker centres (no air-con), he always wears his old PE shorts from high school, carries an old iPhone with a cracked screen, borrows suits to wear to weddings, buys cakes from Four Leaves to celebrate his parents' birthdays, never travels for leisure (only for work), takes the bus and MRT whenever he can etc. The only luxury he'd splurge on is air travel (he only flies SQ but economy). At 30 he already received all of his dad's holdings because they wanted to avoid the inheritance process to save on inconvenience. His parents are the same as he is—believed strongly in a world-class education, for which they were willing to spend an arm and a leg. Otherwise, their whole family pretty much lived by a similar philosophy.
The other three were pretty similar. Middle-class white-collar families. They themselves had white-collar office jobs—two were lawyers and one was a Morgan Stanley banker. They were partygoers. Traveled frequently for leisure. Ate at expensive restaurants. Went to concerts, even paying $1200 on one occasion for two tickets. Bought the latest phones, laptops, gadgets. The banker bought a BMW 3 series 2 years into his job. He also drank expensive spirits and wine. Once, one of them found out that I dated someone from a crazy rich family and he claimed that he was self-made and didn't have to live off daddy's money. All of whom were very eager to present themselves as upper-class, which was completely contrary to what I personally experienced being close to a centimillionaire family. I broke up with all three of them for similar reasons, I didn't enjoy what they did for fun and they kept putting pressure on me to do what they did. The common reason was ""[I] will not be young forever."" I concur, but I much prefer to focus on my work as I am saving up to buy rental properties to retire.
I have taken a break from dating because it is really frustrating that young people who refuse to participate in ""enjoying life"" are somehow treated like there's something wrong with us, when I am almost sure that it wasn't the case one or two generations ago. I'm still trying to make rent, I don't feel like I have enough money in my savings account for if I get laid off, I have student loans etc. I make good money (high 4-figure monthly) as an auditor. I don't think I'm comfortable enough financially to start traveling. But people expect me to. It makes me wonder if society in general think a certain lifestyle is how the ultra-rich tend to live without actually knowing how most of them actually live. Or is it the truth that the wealthy does spend their time in high-living and I just met a guy who was from an unconventional rich family?

How long will the library incident affect my my reputation? It is already several years now, but I often overhear unkind comments and it is difficult to find groupmates who are willing to work with me on projects. It really seems quite unfair and I am considering emigrating overseas just to avoid the unfair discrimination.

60806,107587,"i often read stories abt couples breaking up for their BTO/EC, and lose up to 200k for EC.
i think it is stupid not to proceed with marriage. at MOP, EC typically earns 300-500K.
good location BTO as well also earn 300-500k. you buy at 600k, you sell at 1 million for BTO.
although BTO the penalty is much lesser - just abt 50k penalty after signing agreement for lease.
So If you already sign Agreement For Lease or BTO, or alr exercised the option for EC, then just go ahead with marriage, especially if you are young.
who knows if it might work.
if it doesnt work, in 7 years time you stand to get 300-500k in total. or each person 200k on average.
it is good to have multiple marriages also, it benefits and create employment for family lawyers.
from that MOP sale, you are set with your first pot of gold.

60817,107608,"I graduated from CS many years back.
There is even a term for people like me, the dumping ground batch it seems based on the confessions I have read. I find that extremely derogatory as although I did not have perfect A-Level grades, I did decently and could have my choice of other courses. I had a strong passion for computers and programming since my younger days and so CS was my natural first choice.
I decided to post here for the first time after interacting with several junior SWEs both fresh grads from CS and mid-career transitioners. Most if not all chose this field because of the high pay.
When I ask if they have any side projects, most don't have any. In fact, most of their time was spent on Leetcode and brushing up their interview skills on the hunt for their next job hop and pay increment. Some even have the cheek to insinuate I'm old and outdated as I don't know and have no interest in the latest Data Science, AI, machine learning stuff which they learned in school and I did not. As if DS AI MR are the only fields of CS...
In my time, the people who chose CS came from either of 2 camps, you could not make it to other courses or you have very strong passion for this field. Camp 1 nothing to say. But for those in Camp 2 like me, we were really different. We were motivated by the love of our passion and hobbies, money while important was never our top consideration.
CS now seems like a a money making opportunity. Where is the passion now it seems?

60800,107576,"At a certain age, you all need to grow up.
I posted this elsewhere before, but I'll post this here.
By the age of 25, you all should start thinking about what to do with your future. All those immature attitudes you have since school time should be gone by then. All those drama you purposely got yourself into cause you're so pathetically bored with your life, you should leave all of it at once by then.
25 is a great time to start thinking about what matters in life. To be responsible, discipline, mature, and of course, a grown adult.
I don't care enough if you achieve certain things late, like graduating, marriage, first car, first house, first child, like say by the age of 35+. But 25 is where everyone needs to start take their life seriously. No more childish behaviour. No more drama. No more irresponsible behaviour.
If by the time you reach 60 but your mentality is the same as when you were 20, then all you did was grow old, and didn't grow up.
Stop being such an inconvenience to everyone else with that childish, dumb, irresponsible attitude of yours, especially when you're a grown adult.
Grow up.

This girl was a 10/10 in my opinion. She was pretty, kind and had a nice personality.
However, within a few interactions, I realised that she had no interest in me. I mean I would ask about her and try to get to know her but she never really asked much about me and she seemed quite uninterested during our conversations.
I still maintained as friends with her. Slowly, we got closer and even she started to make jokes and seemed interested in talking with me. She also opened up to me more with her personal stuff more.
I was going through a rough patch with some family problems when she needed some help. I went out of my way to help her but I requested that she helped me with something else which she agreed to do so.
She never returned the favour and I felt hurt by it. I told her that I felt hurt and she said sorry but never actually returned the favour. Instead, she came back to me asking for more help. She also said that the time spent where explained that I felt hurt was a waste of time and she didnt even bother to try to understand why I felt hurt which made me feel sick.
She was spending time with her other friends going outing and stuff which made me feel really small and unworthy, as if I am a tissue paper.
I attribute the whole experience to a single point of failure. She wasn't attracted to me. To put it more bluntly, I wasn't attractive at all.
I really dont want to go through this at all again.
If I like a girl, I want to at least have a fighting chance at it, not be completely ignored like this. At least, she should want to date me to find out if we are compatible.
I want to be attractive.
The problem is I don't know what I am lacking or how to approach this.
I have things like studies figured out. For example, for Math, I just need to practice questions and for English, I just need to read a lot.
However, I dont know what I need to do for this.
If there is a method to do this, I would like to know. Are there any requirements to be attractive?

All my friends know this girl has a huge crush on me.and she has been trying to get my attention for ages. Actually I have no interest in her so I just tried to be polite whenever she talk to me. No flirting whatsoever. Just that the longer I see her, the more I thought why not just talk to her because we are in the same course and I find it hard to avoid her. She has never confessed so I just acted like I didn't know. But it was very obvious and our friends often teased her about it.
I never thought much about it as I wasn't seeing anyone at that time. Once a few of us organized a gathering and I had a few drinks. She came right up to me and tried to talk to me alone. Eventually she confessed that she liked me, I didn't know what reaction she wanted from me so I told her I only saw her as a friend. I was very sure of what I said but she just threw herself at me all of a sudden. I think the drinks took over and we kissed for a while.
Over the next few days she kept texting me, trying to make me officiate our relationship. I thought over it and apolgized to her. I really don't have those kind of feelings for her.
Actually I like someone else but that person has a bf but I don't think its anyone's business so I never told anyone.
Anyway back to this girl. Now she is accusing me of leading her on and taking advantage of her. I don't know what she told her friends but they all kept glaring at me like I'm some big sinner. My friends tell me to just ignore her. They all said I should have pushed her away but guys tend to lose out in these kind of situations so no point arguing with her. They joked that she took advantage of me instead.

60808,107594,"经历了人生一段刻骨铭心的爱情，我意识了几个观点想与大家分享：
1。 不要对自己过于的苛刻- 失败的恋情并不代表你是否值得人去珍惜，爱护。最重要的是你必须爱护好自己因为只有自己会与自己过完人生的最后一秒。绝对不要对不起自己。
2。不要太轻易的相信别人，就算那是你看好觉得你可以放开心房相信的人，这世界是没有绝对的事- 毕竟可能你想要传递的是自己的真心以及想法，但你信任的那个人可能会质疑你的目的并且觉得你是个很偏激的人。
3。每段失败的恋情都会有所失所得的收获- 失去的要拿得起放得下。这也会是你的所得。尽量不要往坏处想，多想想在这过程里，你是否更多的了解自己？自己的好与不好，让后在想你该做出什么样的改变所以事情不会从道负责。
4。 不要放弃- 人的一生，我们都不停的在学习，经历考验。把这失败重重的经历过程，都当做是在磨练自己成为更好的自己。 总有一天，你会遇到那个你不许多传达言语的那个人，也能理解，相信并且支持你。
这总结了我的收获。希望那些处在一样经历的人也能鼓励自己，有所领悟。
我也想对那个让我经历这样的经历的人说： 感谢你曾经来过，你教会了我许多。这段日子，我想开了，也会放开。对于你认为我会做出对你声誉有损的事，请你放心我绝对没有。感到可笑的事，我认为你会有这样的想法是因为你不断的在我背后抹黑我的名誉。算了我也不想与你计较。我也不会去打扰你现在平静的生活。希望你也能做到。这个空间我留给你发会，享受。我决定离开了，希望你在你众多的wife materials当中找到你理想，心意的。

Then everyone in the group was like ""Omg that's so scary"", or ""That's insane knowing the ghost is right there"". Thing is.... There's absolutely nothing :/ I asked where, and everyone gave me a different answer, then all proceeded to go like ""Oh there's actually more than one that's scary"".
So what I did was, I took the photo, put it in Lightroom and just a touch of Photoshop to brighten up the photo enough. And there's still.... Nothing :/ I sent to them and they say I need to look carefully. I even changed different filter to make it clearer, and still nothing. I asked them where are the ghosts at all?
And they kicked me out of the group :/
I showed the photo to my family and other friends, all of them say they can see it and when I showed the brighten up photo edit, all of them hates me for pointing out there's nothing.
I learned that people just want to have the attention of ""Oooh look at meeeee I can see supernatural stuff ooooooh I'm cool you're not ooooh"" :/

Unlike OP, I managed to land a successful match on a dating app and have since gone steady.
However, I was single like him once and I respect his bravery to keep at his own game. I was there in that former pain. I can relate and empathise.
Some of the comments are plain unrealistic and socially unreasonable in their expectations to OP.
The OP brought up a few good points regarding white-knighted and self-virtuous behaviour. It reeks so toxically online. Speaks volumes on how socially inhumane people are.
OP has already stated his stagnating experiences in social events, school activities and the like. People are shaped by their experiences. Who are you to question?
Most of you can't seem to relate that he felt pushed over the edge with no other option or space to interact with the opposite gender. Many of you are so easy to dismiss him for being dangerous and creepy by seeking to try approaching / talking up girls in public places. I guess society has dismissed you badly in your real-lives and make you miserable?
Hypocritically, if the OP wrote a salty rant on how no ladies have ever liked him, why he's single, and some misogyny, all of you would instead be slamming him for not putting himself out there and being a whiny spoilsport.
OP has never expressed he is sore on his fate. Yet you all still slam him for trying. And even calling him out for being sore. Don't get personal if you can't get your facts right.
For those who mentioned Pickup Artist wannabe, the lame comparison reflects on yourself. Out of touch from Dating Apps? Dating Apps and writing Intros is also some form of ""Pick-Up"" behaviour. Albeit online, not in real life.
The Internet also doesn't owe you a duty of care for tailor-worthy content. Some (not all) of you launched very personal attack towards the OP on this. If you have an annoying issue regarding OP's long confession, no TL;DR or that punctuation is misused. That's your own darn problem. Stop projecting your own illiteracy that onto the OP. You chose to read the confession, at your own will.
To those who mocked him for spending too much time over-formulating and asking OP to get his ass off to go outside. Don't forget that OP already spent his past 2 years outside, away from keyboard, working on himself. Only spend I presume 1-2 hours to write his confession? Whilst for you yourself, I also see your name pop up so frequently on the comments section in NUSWhispers? Who should be the one getting his ass off the keyboard and stop being the justice warrior?
As a former single myself, I can totally relate to why many other guys continue to remain Single. Other than the usual issues people mention, what people DO NOT MENTION is peer pressure by society to be socially perfect in decorum. Upon having a track record that you creep girls out, you get socially condemned.
You got to learn that the problem isn't necessarily on you and creep isn't a total reflective indicator of your failures.
I wouldn't be surprised if this is why so many guys give up and accept their fate to be single. And for the mental health rating to be so badly affected. A fear of judgment if they tried their own way to practice and work on it.
Single guys, if you have male friends who are stumping your social growth, overly supervising your image towards girls and being unreasonably critical on how you express yourself towards women, I beg you to reconsider your toxic ""friendship"" aka ""brotherhood"".
It may be better to stand strong alone in your own struggle. A healthy balance of dating apps whilst finding confidence in your own way might work just fine.

60818,107609,"Dear Admin, please post this, as I really need an advice urgently.
Hi all, I have a big question regarding my decision to file it to the executive director or HR of my company, hence I need some suggestions from you guys. I’m a biomedical science researcher and have completed a BSc, a MSc, and a PhD in a local autonomous uni, and had 2 years of work experience. I had very little issues with my previous bosses, and I was even offered a new contract, which I rejected due to my pursuit of my PhD.
Never have I ever expect myself to fail a job probation, ever! Unfortunately, a few days ago my boss told me that I couldn’t meet his expectations, and hence he won’t let me pass my probation. Honestly speaking, as a scientist, I’ve done whatever he asked, and in fact I actually did more than what he expected, like trying out new solutions, thinking of new projects, troubleshooting, etc. I’ve also never once failed to update him whenever he asked for results. Hence, I honestly think this is an extremely unfair treatment to me, and I would like to file a complaint to the HR or executive director of my company.
The way I record my experimental results was one of his reasons to not pass my probation Since the day I joined, I have been doing all data recording based on my own format using powerpoint, excel, and word, which my previous bosses had no problem with at all. However, I was in a big shock when he only told me that my format doesn’t meet his preference at all after 4 freaking months, and demanded me to redo all my data recording according to his ridiculously strict formatting, which certainly takes plenty of time to do, considering the large amount of data accumulated over the past 4 months. I did try my best to do, but bear in mind that his format is ridiculously specific, and it’s not even meant for publication, presentation, conferences, seminars, these results are merely just to show him what I’ve done. Since then, every week he would approach me to complain about very minor issues here and there, and I did tell him that I’m trying my best, and on top of that, I still have to fulfull other duties at work. Imagine having to organize my data in all powerpoint, word, and excel files that I’ve accumulated for 4 months, it really wasn’t easy to do all within a short period of time. If he wasn’t satisfied with the way I record my data, shouldn’t he have told me from the start, instead of telling me after 4 freaking months?
Second was his bad science. I believe the reason why he hired me is due to my experience and expertise in this particular research field, but he refused to take my suggestions/advice positively. I have friends working in big pharma who are experts in this field and I’ve actually consulted them to discuss my ideas before I suggested them to my boss, but my boss always thinks he is right, and doesn’t give me the chance to suggest or execute my ideas as a scientist. To me, as a phd level scientist, I strongly think I should be given the freedom to come out with my own ideas and discuss with him, and be less micromanaged, but his style is totally opposite, where he plans everything on his own without discussing with me, and I can only do as he asked, which really makes me feel as if I’m just a research assistant rather than a postdoc/research fellow.
There was also once where something in our project plan actually went wrong, and he put the blame on me, though it was 100% his fault. All these while I have been trying my best to get the results out as soon as possible, but he asked me to do something else rather than focusing on my experiments, so when the results weren’t out on time, he blamed me for not being to deliver my results as scheduled.
There were also a few things that he asked me to do, and I did as he said, but during the confrontation with him, he said he asked me to do these stuff but I didn’t deliver. I then listed out the tasks that I actually did as he told, and he just brushed it off by saying “it’s okay, I’ve already made my decision anyway”.
What stunt me the most is that I soon found out that he is actually running out of funding as his grant application has failed, and the lab funding was worsened after the institute decided to cut funding, so in order to keep the lab going, he has to cut cost by laying off staff. Since I’m still on probation, he can actually leverage my probation to kick me out, just by simply saying that I can’t meet his expectations, which is actually not true.
What should I do? Should I just let him terminate me? Should I resign? Or should I file a complain to the company’s HR or director?
Thanks.

60796,107568,"How do you guys deal with the insecurity? I am working in healthcare and this girl I'm seeing is a cute nurse colleague. In our field, some patients are (partly) naked due to their limited capacities/illnesses/procedures and the nurses have to physically handle them in their various degrees of undress. If they were regular old patients I wouldn't really care, but once in a while they have to go check or even adjust some young, fit guy's d*ck and it makes me feel weird and kinda jealous. Once I heard her talking with another nurse about if they needed to some procedure on a guy's genitals and I was so disturbed I just pretended I didn't hear them and quickly walked away. I mean I know it's just part of the job - and maybe even hypocritical of me to say as someone in healthcare myself - but I can't help but feel like nakedness is something sacred to be treasured and shared with a partner exclusively, but that some kind of innocence is lost here..

60812,107603,"I am not angry, just upset with the dynamics between me and my mum and idk how to make things better.
My mum rarely asks about my day or what I do. When I initiate to tell her stuff, she starts talking about herself or my siblings. When this happens I stop talking. Not because I'm upset but because I have no idea if my own mother is interested in me. I don't want to keep talking if she is not interested. It's fine. I can share those stories with my friends, even though she is my mum and I want her to know something about me. She knows nothing about me beyond 7 years old.
I don't blame her. Personally I feel having three kids is too much for her to handle. She is occupied with my older sister and my younger sis who are more accomplished. She simply doesn't have any spare attention or energy for me. Not that she doesn't want to.
Sigh. Not interested in me? Fine. But it's annoying when she starts saying things about me that are not true. For instance, telling her friends that I don't eat a certain food. Fuck bitch. I have been eating that in front of you my whole life. You just haven't been paying attention.
Sometimes i think that maybe I would be happier without my family. The lack of connection breaks my heart more than anything.
Anyone in a similar situation? How to make things better? As time goes by, my family becomes the last perosn I tell anything to. It's sad. I cannot express how lonely I feel. I know my family loves me but there is no understanding and no connection. No one knows anything about me at home. They remember nothing even if I told them. Being busy is one thing but if you don't ask and don't remember shit then that is just messed up. Also, I am always the last perosn to know things at home. They discuss with each other at their own time and one notices that I'm not being told. I don't think it's intentional. It's prolly just that there are too many people (?) . I'm married with kids.

60819,107611,"Ref #96185
I chanced upon your confession from 21 March 2021 regarding the pick-up culture of girls in Singapore. This surprised me. I did not know someone had asked this online before.
I hope you read this, despite being 2 years late.
You wrote: ""How is it still possible for guys who have lost faith in online dating to stand a chance to meet interesting girls that they randomly come across on the street? Or is it really a social stigma in Sg that random guy approaching a girl on the MRT is deemed a creep? Are there any effective solutions to this?""
You have met someone, mid-20s, who has done a good degree of all of that for 2 years now. Working at it for the past 2 years (since 2021) until today, and still pressing on.
My personal story cut very short is that I was persistently rejected by girls during compulsory education years, and short-changed of genuine interactions when signing up for Events. Problem with Events is that you cannot pick / choose who you pair with. Certain people there can socially judge you negatively for being some despo (and hungry) who just want to pick/date girls.
They make you feel bad for something you were genuinely shortchanged and then benchmark u as a social creep. These are toxic, socially over-privileged who don't know what's like to not have natural social advantage.
In other cases, signing for events/dating-events/CCAs do not guarantee your gender-balance and you end up wasting precious time trying to fit-into group decorum to which you never really signed up for.
I personally felt I was running out of years to get valuable practice and bucket list feelings/desires of just flirting and being playful around the opposite-gender in general.
You would have side-tangent your main purpose - which is to practice approaching girls of your desire, try to get them feeling comfortable around you and see if they're willing to stay in contact thereafter.
I decided to take things into my own hands and cut-away all of that unnecessary social-off-tangent. Those social settings dont work for me. Perhaps its coz I have my own line of thinking. I wanted for myself, a free space to test and explore my own thinking and what I really wanted to experience during my general interactions with girls.
I also wanted to stress-test what I could achieve, express and adjust when I interacted with girls. And find how exactly, I can reduce the likelihood of creeping them out over the course of my Work. And to also spend time reflecting on what kind of girls I need to let go - despite me trying and failing at hitting on them.
I never regretted. I had full autonomy on the exact type and looks of girls I caught-eye and wanted to hit on. This basic feeling should not be taken for granted.
The past 2 years consisted of me falling back on dormant legacy personality traits from young. For me, I had this thing about words and writing. Hence, I wrote cards of general message/encouragement and use it as a leverage to give it to a girl of my choice. You could append your number behind, or just a handle if you weren't keen enough to be so open. You can take creative direction and just adjust what you wanna say based on the season or place you are going to visit. Possibilities are endless and you feel real good just expressing yourself.
I tried many things. From just merely giving and not talking. To the more recent years of relying less on my card and really just speaking to test water. When my confidence grew, I allocated greater emotional strategy to Exit away from girls who replied to me in a very ignorant manner. Coz - abundance mindset.
For the good girls I experienced and successfully gave my card. You ofc hope they get back to you. However, whether a conversation does hold thru - still mirrors what you recounted. yourself.
From that point on, I opened my own exploring on what works, what doesn't work and most importantly - what lasts as a good impression.
This act on girls and cards also tested me regarding all various ways, permutation and setting I can best approach them. At times, making mistakes, feeling nervous and consequently creeping them out were inevitable. Nevertheless, thru the bad emotions I felt, I pressed on somehow to just find another way to do it - to also let go and self-talk against past emotional baggage that remind me that ""I'm creepy/despo to do all this.""
I encourage you to go out and try pick up girls in your best self in public places. You have to start somewhere and see which parts of your own personality are best tapped on when you vibe off to a girl you eye candied. You also get this priceless benefit to explore all these bucket-list excitements, emotions and flirt-desires before you really get too old to regret not doing them.
Its good to have your fill of these very impulsive stuff instead of answering society norm to ""feel to clean and decent in front of all girls in the Universe - that approaching/pursuing girls you don't know is condemned upon"".
The micro-thrills of some girl you hit on through your own effort - replying to your number, Tele or IG DM or beaming at your flirts/thoughtfulness etc - is priceless to experience. An important bucket list to experience enough of before you get too old to look appropriate for the Acts.
Find ""yourself"" whilst you look around outside. You have your own type and age range of girls. Take ownership and don't feel bad for having such a preference. So long as you stay respectful and genuine. Have nothing to hide.
I am personally still kicking my bucket list to talk up school girls/students as much as I can - if such suitable opportunities arise. It feels good to be young again.
The self-discovery journey is not guaranteed to be easy. I had my very testing and emotional moments in earlier periods of missing girls, lacking confidence, getting affected by social reminders and at worse cases, creeping girls out because they could already sense I'm present even before I do anything.
Advice for you - creeping girls out will be inevitable. Keep telling yourself that no guy is socially pitch-perfect to creep 0 girls in his entire life. Don't listen to any white-knighted guy who socially reminds you about (sexual) harassment and fear of accusation, and then links back to how ""you need to be a decent guy.""
These are people who gaslight what you truly want in your social energy and its your right to explore as much of it. Just know when to let go of some girl if she just looks at you so revoltingly.
Think statistically on ""Creep Rate"". You can't impress everyone. What you can best do is to work on confidence and timing such that you can REDUCE the likelihood of creepiness by making approaches as seamless, natural and clean (minimal hesitation) as possible. It will take time. You will not master it overnight. Neither does it stay consistent from girl to girl because you also may be sensitive and conscious about her unspoken vibe.
Once you have enough experience of picking-up girls. You will come to feel good that you have your own reserve and abundance of experiences to look back on. You will come to realise how some girls were just plain bs to hit on. Perhaps it was just looks and shallowness (and prob some lust) you approached them.
On the contrary - you may feel surprised to reflect on the other set of girls who left a good, sweet, gracious and decent impression on you - even if you didn't eventually get to date them and have since fallen out of conversation. It will guide you better on what exactly you are looking for in your ideal girl.
For me, I sort of had my rough image of that girl. My experiences have been slowly helping me confirm most of such vibes and features as what really counts. Very recently, I had personal encounters with (6-7)/10 girls (on looks) but proud of myself to have advanced on them because of their (8-9)/10 personality.
Sometimes also due to age gap, these girls are still maturing in look - but personality 100. I believe that they have potential to become even prettier in later years.
There is also a risk that some girl's boyfriend will reply you/confront you online regarding ""picking-up"" their girlfriend in the public place. You will need to know how to deal with it.
(1) pick your battles. You do not need to reply every boyfriend who messages you back. Some of these boyfriends may just be insecure pussy who just dont trust their girlfriend enough that she will be easily swayed to you.
(2) If you choose to reply that boyfriend, just tell them what you are doing and looking for. You got nothing to hide. But no need to be too nice. You dont owe them an apology. You hit on a girl (back then) to which you got no reason to believe she is attached. All you only did is just talk her up and give her your card. At most - just say sorry if the gf felt creeped out.
Different strokes work for different timings/environments. Not every setting you can afford talking a girl up. Sometimes, its just better to approach, say your small piece, give her your card and then walk away. Other times, it is better to spend time small talking her up or at least, just confessing your feelings and outright asking for her number.
You own your adjustments and flexibility. Versatility is all on you. There is so much more experience I could share with you but - it would be very lengthy.
For now, please just know that you got someone here supporting you in finding your true happiness, albeit it being socially deviant. Throw those peer pressure advice out the window! Listen to yourself.
Don't regret not doing enough when you are older and when your age is really way above that your own conscience cannot take it.
All the best!

60828,107629,"I can't relate to a lot of people's common childhood experiences. And I feel pretty left out.
Example 1 : People told me that they need to hide under the blanket to feel safe from potential ""ghost"" attacking. Or they won't let their foot hang outside of the bed area or else something will pull them. I couldn't relate cause logically if there's ghost or monsters, why are they so immune to the blanket when they can just take it off and attack you?
Example 2 : People told me they felt panic when their mom asked to wait in line to pay while she go get something, and as the line moves pretty fast, people told me the panic is real cause their mom is not back yet to pay and it's close to their turn at the cashier. I couldn't relate to the panic feeling cause when my mom asked me to wait in line, and when it's my turn, I simply just say I'm sorry and that my mom is not here yet, so I just went back in line. What is there to panic about? Obviously you can't pay, so just go back.
And many other childhood things people typically experiences, I just couldn't relate. Everyone seems to bond really well when they talk about it. I feel really left out.

But I can't. Men aren't supposed to show self pity. I'm 39, I have a newborn son, so stick to this job in these uncertain times and suck it up.

I took time to read through everything. I feel so enraged.
By the way people have put you down online.
Applaud your courage to have tried relentlessly over the past 2 years despite lack of results.
Who r the rest to negatively judge you for your actions? No one is perfect. At least you are actively trying instead of sitting around and sulking why you are single.
Seeing most of the 25+ comments on this confession, most of these comments are coming from socially-entitled and self-virtuous individuals who cannot be pleased and expect perfect decorum on social behaviour even when it means trying something that others don't dare to try.
Hypocritical that we keep advocating on a more socially inclusive and open-minded society/space. Society to also keep obliging that guys should put in effort to try work on their interaction and social skills towards girls and dating etc.
Yet when someone actually shares his candid experiences, its only met with white-knighted criticism and scrutiny. Have more social backbone and stop latching into other guys social failures to amplify your own moral high ground.
OP, word of advice for u. This kind of thing, better to share offline. People don't appreciate, so be it. Don't be too affected by what other ppl say. However, continue to work on your confidence so that girls feel less creep out. Learn to live life and let go.
Those ppl are the real coward to hide behind keyboard and attack you, whilst you have spent 2 years outside actively trying and getting actual work done. Some of their names appear very frequently on this platform unlike your confession. Online double standards are real.

Hi, I'm a 26Y (F) and my Bf 28Y (M). We've been in a stable relationship for the past 4.5 years and recently applied for a BTO as we plan to settle down soon. With work being hectic, we decided to clear our leaves & take a 14-days getaway to Europe. We've already planned the itinerary and made the necessary bookings, but now his mother wants to join us at the final minute. While I don't mind her coming along, she's suggesting additional activities that we're not particularly interested in, and I'm feeling pressured to add in the itinerary. To make matters more complicated, she's also invited her extended family, turning our ""honeymoon"" holiday into a family trip. I've proposed having some days dedicated to spending time with his family and others for just the two of us, in an attempt to find a compromise. Despite my willingness to find a compromise, she insisted that we should stick together due to the unfamiliar environment. Although this trip was intended to be a time of relaxation and rejuvenation, I find myself feeling both confused and stressed. I understand and appreciate his close relationship with his mother but these emotions are beyond my control.

I’m sorry I lied all those years ago when I said my depression was getting better when it truly wasn’t.
You looked so crestfallen when you couldn’t help me. And so happy when I made slight progress.
Maybe the faking to make myself look happy helped.
I’m better now. But I’m sorry I lied then.
I shouldn’t have. then I could have gotten the help I needed earlier.

60829,107630,"sorry for the long post ahead!!!
The company I'm interning at now planned nothing for me during my summer internship.
This internship was different from what I was studying but still somewhat relevant. During the interview, it was discussed with me that i would be involved in an implementation project, but after accepting it and a few weeks before the start of the internship, I was informed of a change in my supervisor due to restructuring which i didnt think much of as i assumed the work would be the same.
But on day one, I found out that my supervisor changed as the department's division that I was supposed to be tagged to was consolidated with a third party company within the same building with all the projects being handed over to them. and my supposed department's job scope had completely changed! My supervisor had nothing planned for me and put me under them where they were nice enough to let me tag along, but this also meant I am always in a different office from my supposed supervisor. I didn't ask my sch's mentor for advice bc i assumed it would be fine, pls dont flame me i just wanted to learn to be independent;-;
So ever since day 1, I have been trying to learn from the third party team I am tagged to, and having to ask for work every day for 2months now. Luckily for me, the third party team was nice enough to give me 2 projects to work on both with very different job scopes.
I know i shouldnt be complaining about this but the projects were mostly put on hold most of the time after I've reached a deliverable, and now one of them has been on hold for a month as they do not have a no way for me to test the prototype due to their restrictions and slow response time from seeking approvals/advice on their side. and my2nd project just came a few weeks ago and is also delayed due to slow response from clients. so ive still been just asking for work daily while waiting, ive been given some adhoc tasks which i completed quickly and properly, other than that theres mostly nothing to do at my desk. i do try to watch/learn new things online during this ""free"" time but i just feel so useless during these 2 months.
To add on, because the 1st projecthad no deadlines, my workplan was not very detailed even after discussing it with the third party team and my supposed supervisor. so it got rejected and now i have to submit a revised one, and i think the sch's mentor seemed unhappy about it in his comments saying im learning lesser. so now im worried about the doing the sch report and end of internship presentation :( i've still been asking for work and projects to be involved in but there's nothing much going on with my projects and in general while I wait...
what should i do for my report and presentation? and for my final month while waiting for said projects?

60797,107569,"TLDR: My gf hates my family and says and does mean things to them secretly, but I love her. What should I do?
My gf and I have been together for almost 4 years now. We are staying together in my family’s home. We grew up in completely different backgrounds so naturally we would have different upbringing. Before we got together, I had brought 2 very important points to her and that is my family is very important to me and if she can get along with them, it would mean the world to me. And if she can’t, I would really appreciate her being courteous towards them. I feel like my parents have been treating her so nicely and doesn’t disrespect her in any way because she is who I chose. But it has been almost 4 years and she hasn’t shown any basic respect at all (eg: greeting my parents when she sees them when we/she return home). And honestly to me, this is a huge disrespect. I had sat her down and talked about this so many times, but it just doesn’t seem to be working.
Recently she also confessed me out of guilt that she contaminates my parent’s food / drinks with my dog’s urine and that is freaking unhygienic and disgusting. I was too stunned to speak when she confessed. I didn’t know what to do or say at all… It has been a week and we haven’t talked yet. She keeps saying she’s very apologetic but I really do not know if I am able to get pass this. I honestly fear for my family’s safety if this continues because I don’t know what will happen in the future if she gets annoyed at them again… And as a cherry on top, she is living here rent free and does not help out in any chores at all.
I love her a lot and really wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, but after hearing her confession I really don’t know what to do or feel now.

60833,107635,"I read a post here about a 10/10 girl or something and the comments were mostly not useful or just mostly trolls.
I am in a similar situation to the OP where I want a girl who is (8-10)/10 but I am probably much lower. I also have friends (both gender) who are in similar situations.
If you are someone that believes that someone's rating (not a good word but for discussion sake, pls let it through) should be static, then this post is not for you, move on pls.
The premise for this post is that you can improve your rating and possibly even become a 10/10 from a 0/10.
I think there are two main benefits of this thought -
Firstly, it is basically self-improvement, pretty sure it makes someone feel more confident, feel good and probably has results in a better life.
Secondly, you can get your 10/10 girl or your dream crush or whatever.
By the way, this 10/10 is not just physically attractiveness, it could mean other aspects such as personality or whatever.
I am a CS student so I think of things logically and step by step so there are here are questions:
Assuming I am starting out as a 0/10 person,
1) What are the main aspects I should work on to reach 10/10 (not limited physical attractiveness, can include others as well)?
2) How should I approach this problem?
3) What are resources that I can refer to, if any?
I hope this helps other people as well and is a positive thread.
There are quite a number of guys and girls in similar situations.

60843,107646,"To #107608, I'm a one such recent CS grad and take offence at your claim that we are in CS only for the money and not passion. I wonder where are your logic skills when you paint entire batches from your small sample size of a couple of junior SWEs.
While I do not dismiss your accusation that many in my batch chose CS because of the high starting pay, I have met many who are in CS because of similar passions in computing. They have sizable side projects and have formidable programming skills even before entering NUS. I dare say many did not need a CS college education at all if not for that piece of paper that HR and some jobs require.
On the issue of pay, what is wrong with going for courses that pay more? With times of high inflation, rising cost of living and housing prices, it's natural for us to go for degrees with higher ROI. It's economics 101 of demand and supply.
If road sweepers were to be paid the same as CS grads, tons of people will line up to be one. However, I'm certain you won't complain about the lack of passion of road sweepers.
Being in a MANGA company for a year and several internships in SMEs before I graduated, I have worked with many seniors. While some are good, I noticed a distinct and noticeable gulf between the average of those who graduated more than 5 to 8 years back and the newer batches. I recall Prof Ben commenting somewhere about seniors who were really quite weak so this is not an isolated observation.
Nobody said DS, AI and ML are the only fields in CS. However those skills are the current baseline for a CS grad and the tech industry. If you don't believe me, even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says those without AI expertise will be left behind. When you show no interest in them, you are only betraying yourself in not even having an minimum industry skillset. I honestly worry for your future in tech with this kind of stagnant mindset.
If your attitude is representative of your batch, you all deserve to be left behind in the dumping ground.

Furthermore, when going out, small meals like food would be paid directly by me as she does not bring her wallet along, knowing that I would pay for them. I am alright to pay for small meals which are lesser than $10 per person but I would want to go dutch on shopping mall restaurants as they are generally more expensive. Overall, I am just a student with a part-time job that pays me enough to survive by myself. She would pay me back whenever her parents gives her allowance but would usually end up in debt since the allowance would be spend on other items such as clothing.
Whenever speaking about finances, she would claim that I look at money too seriously.
Should I remain with her till she graduates to see if she has more serious financial planning or should I just break-up?

60825,107626,"Find it really weird that some people are in such disagreement with being frugal and saving for retirement. The most common reason I’ve read is “you’re going to grow old and miss out on all the things you could have done with your youthful energy.”
Let’s run a thought experiment. Assuming you don’t save right. When you’re 60 (and the life expectancy in Singapore is at least 80), and your income goes to zero, what then? Whether you remember your 20s and 30s for all the things you did, you will hit 60. Barring any freak accidents, we will all hit 60. Inflation would have happened at least for 30 years. If you hadn’t built enough wealth or passive income by then, you’re going to have a really difficult time bootstrapping for resources as an older person with obsolete skills.
By my age, my uncle (now 50) already had 2 apartments paying him rent. Because of extremely thoughtful financial planning, he was able to retire at 45. Most of his money came from his real estate investments. He travels monthly, goes to concerts, drives an Audi, eats at atas restaurants, life is great for him. His trick was fairly simple. He spent a minimal amount of money for the first 10 years except on necessities and investments; for the next 10 when his income blew up he made larger investments. By his 40s he was already worth 8 figures. He was an Oxbridge trained lawyer and a retired as a senior partner.
Is 45 really that old? He runs 2.4km faster than I can run at half his age. I’m not saying everyone can make a lot of money just by being frugal and delaying gratification; but whatever the case, it would be more than spending $500 on a Taylor Swift concert when you’re only earning $3000. That’s more than 15% of your income on a useless thing!
The next thing you know all these people are going to start calling for communism because they didn’t work hard on their wealth and are somehow surprised when they don’t have money when they need it.

60858,107672,"Prof Ben,
This will be a rather unique message to the ones you typically receive because I don’t have a question for you. What I do have is a thank you. Thank you for saving my life.
When I was at NUS, I was a struggling student; not because I was getting bad grades, but because I chose a course for the income and prestige not because it was a natural choice for me. I was in NUS med. Yet I was always better with languages than I was in science. I did well out of just a good mastery of studying techniques but I wasn't interested in the medicine nor any of the biological sciences.  
The other reason why I forced myself to enroll in medicine was because I was always under the impression that only the smartest people did medicine. My brother was doing medicine at Imperial at the time and I just really didn't want to lose. It didn't help that my dad was a cardiothoracic surgeon and my mom is a scientist at a biotech company. Nobody forced me to take medicine, it was my choice.
I hated every second of it. By the end of the third year, I genuinely wanted to kill myself. I was in such a dark place because even though I was doing well in school, I had zero passion for the subject. But I was in so deep at that point I thought that I was going to spend the rest of my life doing this. One dark night, I almost had enough Ibuprofen to overdose, but I stopped myself. I spent that night crying in the bomb shelter of my house. 
Out of a desperate search for an identity, I borrowed some of the legal textbooks of my best friend and I discovered a real love for the subject, in particular, American constitutional law. After a few months of getting into deep conversations with my friend, I was hooked. At the same time, I came across a piece that you wrote about perfectly intelligent people being good at one thing but not another. I just didn't have the stamina for medicine mostly because I did not have the slightest interest in seeing another picture of a scrotal fungal infection.
I decided to sit down for ultimatum talks with my parents to allow me to drop out. Because I had been out of sorts for at least 3 years by then, it was more of a relief to my dad that I had that conversation with him. He told me that he was going to support me regardless of what I wanted to do. I dropped out. I did some research and I decided that I wanted to do law in the US. I didn't want to do a gap year, so I picked a small state school with rolling admissions and unrestricted semester course loads and I finished my 4-year degree in political science and philosophy in 2.5 years. Guess what? This fall will be my last year at Harvard Law. I plan to do a doctorate and go into teaching.
The main takeaway from this is the fact that not only should people not beat themselves up over not having a gift to be good at their chosen ""thing,"" even if one has indeed been good at something, it doesn't mean that it is what they ought to be doing. People called a witch-hunt for you earlier this year because I think people fundamentally mistook you for allegedly claiming that people without an aptitude in one thing are stupid and will never be good at anything. Even though I don't doubt that there could be people who are mediocre at everything, there will always be something that they could do that they will have more passion and talent at than every other thing. Do that.

60859,107678,"It's going to be a long story that I need to get off from my chest and pardon me from all my grammar in case there are any grammar police in the comments section.
I have been with my gf for 4 years since 2019 and there were many ups and downs between us. But today she decided to break up with me because of everything that happened and also because of her parents. Some back story - she has depression and I have been by her side in early 2019 and decided to get together with her because I really care for her. And there was once she attempted by overdosing and I went with her to the hospital and stayed overnight with her. Her parents didn't even came to visit her immediately and they only came the following morning with policeman and I was arrested and detained for 48 hours because her parents told the police that I was the cause of her to suicide. It took me 1 year to get her parents to really understand me and I have to endure things like can only sit at the balcony because I am forbidden to go into their living room, I cant use their toilet and have to run to the nearest toilet outside to use before running back to her house balcony. Everything was ok but in 2020 when my gf shared her dreams over dinner table with her mum and elder sister, she got shot down by saying she becoming an accountant will never be rich as an interior designer and that almost made her want to attempt again but it took me a while to calm her down while maintaining my cool in front of her parents. Side track her sister is an interior designer and she is always borrowing money from my gf which pisses me off because when my gf doesn't have enough to lend her, the sister would tell her mum and she will get scolded badly for being useless. Her sister is also married to an Ang Moh banker and stays in a bungalow, have 3 dogs and a helper and 1 son and the irony is she always have to borrow money. Another irony is her sister could stay overnight with her then bf and not give a shit about her mum and her sister could easily get away with not paying her university school fees and not get scolded by her parents, but I have to made sure I was a good guy before my gf could stay over at my house.
I hate her sister because she keeps telling my gf to find Ang Moh or find sugar daddy so she can have money, saying i am useless and not earning as much as her husband. And her mum keeps telling my gf to find someone around her age like her classmates and all, i am only slightly older than my gf who have graduated and in the workforce. All this overwhelming thoughts went into her mind and depressive state which one day in 2022 she decided to take a break from our relationship and dated someone else but she was not happy because the guy abused her, forcing her to do things against her will. Her mum did not want to help her break up, so I stepped in and told off the guy and her mum, and this incident cause her mum and dad to have bad impression of me. We have to hide our relationship moving forward and it appears to be very taxing for her and just today she said it to me and said her parents will never be accepting us and growing older, she feel that she wants to have her parents validation and blessings as compared to 4 years ago when she just wanted to heck care them. I don't get it, her parents don't even give her allowance, don't even pay for her medical bills when she see doctor and psychologists, don't even give her money and ask her to keep buying things from Shopee or buying food home, don't even care about her and only scold her for being useless when she can't lend her sister money, to date she have already lend her sister 3k. Even if she gets awards from school, the parents don't even bat an eyelid. Yet today she says she don't see a future in the relationship and wants to break up. I really don't know what to do now, as much as I hate her parents and want to bring her out from that shit hole, suddenly she drop me a bomb saying that.
