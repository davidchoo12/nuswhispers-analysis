58626,103214,"I dated a poor guy. We were both from NUS, graduated so in love and very much I n debt. Blame that on the student loans we had to take. Our dates were mostly hunting for cheap and good hawker food, cooking at home, going shopping in neighbourhood markets, streaming movies online and cuddling. We didn't celebrate anniversaries, partly because he couldn't afford and always refused to have me pay for everything, but mostly as we didn't bother to remember the dates. For everyday we were together in the past years was special and I would not trade my days with him for any gold or diamonds. I love my poor boyfriend, except now that he has becomed my debt-free/start-up owner/decent income earner/still extremely hot fiancée. We still don't celebrate anniversaries, and we still go hunting for cheap deals. He still opens the door for me, pulls out chairs and tells me he loves me everyday. We just bought our first home together in a pretty condo (missed the HDB income ceiling by a few thousands) and are expecting our first baby in a few months time. Girls, believe in your men. They might struggle at times but if you love them unconditionally, they would do anything to give you the happy endings you deserve

57726,101466,"My boyfriend and I were holding hands while strolling around fortcanning today. He isn't the most comfortable with holding hands in public because society can still be homophobic at times, but I really appreciate that he still does it anyway when he feels like it.
Anyway we were walking up a flight of stairs and a lady and her 4/5 year old child walking down. My first instinct was 'should I let go of his hand' because some parents think their child can catch the gay by seeing two guys hold hands or whatever. But to our surprised she actually smiled and gave us a thumbs up. My boyfriend was so touched afterwards and it really brightened our day. So shout out to that lady I hope you're reading this and hope your son grows up to be amazing like you.

58965,103843,"To OP #103823 I was like you 25 years ago and truly understand what is like living paycheck to paycheck.
I gave up my poly study at year 2 and work as a teller cos I couldn’t bear my younger brothers being affected my my family situation and they couldn’t concentrate on their studies. So I chose to work to support my parents and siblings.
No one will understand how it is like when your friends need not bat an eyelid on Starbucks but you have to refund EZ-Link card to use the money to buy dinner for the family cos your payday is on the next day and will credit in midnight.
My husband (back then still boyfriend) never once say anything or complain. But he was equally poor???? staying in an one-room rented flat. We saved every single cent, dates were usually at hawkers or foodcourt. We held our wedding dinner at a Chinese restaurant and even ‘earn’ back our dinner cost with money for overseas honeymoon.
Now with 2 kids and staying comfortably in a 4-room HDB flat, combined income still below $10k, we never once feel ‘inferior’ as compared to our peers. We are ‘debt free’ as our cpf have surplus to cover the housing loan monthly. We have no car, no condo, restaurant meals seldom exceeded $80 for fam of 4 but we are contented.
Our nights are spent chasing dramas on the bed, no drinking at pubs, no cafe hopping as all these are $$$$ and $$$. Kids during their free time, play bubble guns at the corridor, Nintendo switch and mobile games. All these activities really no need much money but still keep us occupied.
Guess god ‘compensate’ my hard life by giving me a good husband albeit we are defined as ‘poor’ in today’s context. So the question you really have to ask yourself is whether u love your boyfriend and if he is the right person who you can depend on for the next 30 years. Some may have the rich boyfriend/hubby but still unhappiness over 3rd party or debt issues.
Life is short, don’t think so much if he is really good.

59036,104015,"This is my mid-career switch experience from teaching to software engineering. If you are thinking of doing the same, I hope my post would help you in some ways. Long story ahead.
I graduated from NIE with a bachelor in arts degree and was bonded to MOE for four years. During my four years of teaching, I gave my all and was performing above average. However, I always knew I wanted to try something else besides teaching. At that time, I didn't know what the alternative was but I just couldn't see myself in teaching for the rest of my life. Towards the end of my four years bond, I wrote my resume and applied to various job adverts on LinkedIn. I was lucky as one of the companies replied me. While I didn't have the necessary skills they needed, I promoted myself as someone willing to learn and keened to work for the company. I was prepared to take a pay cut as I knew I was starting from scratch again. I settled for a 40% pay cut for this new job.
Unfortunately, things didn't work out well for me as I found the job to be rather mundane. I knew I wouldn't get anywhere with the skills from this job and decided to cut loss by ending my employment with the company at the end of my probation period.
The good thing that came out of this was I realized I wanted to work in an environment where there would be minimal face-to-face interaction and it should be stimulating enough for me. During that period, SkillsFuture was encouraging people to join the IT industry and they were promoting this professional conversion programme for mid-career switchers to train them in IT programming. I decided to go for it. At the same time, I made use of my $500 skillsfuture credit to purchase programming courses on Udemy and continued with my learning at home.
To be honest, the courses provided by the training institute were insufficient. I was expected to learn OOP, MVC programming in 5 days, which was just impossible for someone like me without any programming background. But I was determined to figure it out. So when I was not in class, I would be following my Udemy instructor and learning on my own. The entire conversion programme took around 6 months. I updated my resume with a few mini projects I did and began my job search process. In total, I applied to close to 100 job applications and only heard back from 4 of them. I still remember the agony I went through to this day. You must understand teachers have it easy when it comes to getting a job. Our jobs were handed to us even before we graduated. We didn't have to go through this excruciating job searching process and I was jobless for more than half a year. All the self-doubt, anxiousness and negative thoughts were just eating me up every night. While waiting to hear back from the companies, I practised my interviewing skills, did leetcode, continued with my Udemy courses and prayed. I also gave part-time tuition during this period to help with my daily expenses.
After being unemployed for more than 7 months, my breakthrough came. My friend referred me to their company's HR internally. I was given an opportunity to do an online technical test which I passed and was subsequently interviewed by the project manager and MD. What helped was the mini projects I did and knowing the basics of OOP. They extended an offer to me and this ended my 8 months drought. I was drawing a fresh grad pay. It was 20% higher than my last drawn pay. While it was still lower than what I was last drawing in teaching, the opportunity to work and learn in this industry was more important than the salary. I knew I had to be humble and learn from my colleagues who were all younger than me.
The learning curve was steep but I enjoyed every part of it. I'm coming to 3 years in this industry and in these 3 years, I attained two cloud solutions architect associate certifications and was promoted to a senior position. I burnt many nights and weekends away studying and upskilling myself in new technologies.
Looking back, leaving teaching was a leap of faith. With a degree in arts and four years of work experience only in teaching, it was really difficult to find something comparable in the commercial sector. To those who are thinking of leaving teaching or even joining the IT industry, I would advise that you try out those programming courses on Udemy first during after office hours and weekends. It'll minimally take you 3 months to figure out what you are doing. But you must persevere. Rewatch the videos until you get it. Figure out if this is for you. Most of the udemy courses will teach you by building projects. Make changes to those projects and customize them so that you can show them in your resume. If you plan to go for the diplomas or certifications provided by higher-level institutes, make sure you have enough savings to do so. Even if you don't plan to, you should also make sure you have enough savings for your expenses in case you need to settle for a pay cut. Those in teaching, at least leave after you've collected your 4 years connect plan.
I got headhunted by another company during this recent tech hiring spree with a happy increment. I'm now drawing a salary higher than what I would be getting if I were to stay in teaching. Most importantly, I'm doing something I can see myself doing till my retirement. Was it scary? You bet. But I grew so much in these three years when I chose to leave my comfort zone and I'm glad I made that decision 4 years ago. Oh, and not to forget the benefits of working from home.
To those who choose to stay in teaching, I have nothing but admiration for all of you. The working hours are tough and there is no such thing as work-life balance. You are a teacher to your students 24/7. Thank you! To those who need a way out, maybe this could be an option for you to consider. All the best!

58807,103530,"tl;dr: I cheated with my female colleague and I feel very bad about it. What made it worse was that my wife witnessed the cheating…
I'm happily married with a wonderful wife with two kids. I work in marketing in an FMCG company and I'm constantly surrounded by younger female colleagues. Ngl, many of them are very attractive but I'm a faithful man who thinks with his bigger head.
However my life recently turned upside down. There's this female colleague who recently joined, let's call her G. G is in her late twenties and has a face and figure many women would die for and many men would go for. I was so surprised to find out that she was single (she gave me that information without me asking). G would constantly ask me for advice dealing with work matters and invite me to go lunch together with her batch. Sometimes we go for lunches and it's just the two of us. G would constantly ask me what I was doing over the weekend and tell me what her plans were. She was actively using dating apps but none of the guys were up to her standards. She would often flirt with me (I think?) Like when we are alone she would playfully brush my arms and sometimes bump into me (too often for it to be by accident). She’d also tell me about her experiences with her dates and how they're not good, and I'm so much better. I always felt a weird sensation whenever I hear that from her. It’s a nice feeling to be validated, but I’m married and it feels wrong.
One fateful day, as my wife had to use the car that day, she came to my office to pick me up. As I was walking away from the office with my wife, G somehow appeared out of nowhere and said hi to us and was extremely friendly towards my wife. G and my wife started chatting as if they were besties and they somehow ended up organizing a games night at my place that weekend. G said she’d bring her date over.
Fast forward to that day, G came with her date. Not sure why but I felt a tinge of jealousy seeing him. We decided to play some card games and I ended up partnering with G. This is when things went down. G was secretly texting me the cards she had in her hand and signaled me to read my phone. I got the hint and was trying to discreetly look at my phone. However, my wife caught me doing that and snatched my phone away and she saw the message from G. She acted like it was ok but after G and date left, she was so furious that I cheated with G during the games and my wife refuses to talk to me now.
How can I appease my wife?

58625,103217,"I am a freshmen in NUS. My father works as a roadside cleaner while my mother cleans houses. I have never been ashamed to tell my friends what my parents do for a living for it is after all an honest living regardless of the job scope. In fact, I am grateful for my parents for despite their low incomes they have never failed to provide for both my sisters and I. At first glance, you would never assume that I came from a low-income family because I carry an iPhone and dress decently from labels like H&M and Zara. Yes it is difficult, having to take on part-time jobs (currently taking on 2 part-time jobs) all my life but I do not complain for my parents are my motivation to continue to push through the demands of both school and work. Being in NUS means the world for me as it brings me one step closer to earning a stable income and ridding my family from poverty. I guess through this post, I hope to inspire others out there who are having a hard time now. Find your motivation. Find that light at the end of the tunnel, the rainbow after a storm and before you know it, giving up would never be an option. Nobody said that this was easy but it definitely helps to have a support system so strong you never feel alone.

59017,103962,"To #103947
I'm a stay home mum in my mid 30s, my husband's income is about $12k, which I consider substantial. Being pragmatic and frugal by nature allows us to sustain this single income lifestyle where I can stay home w the kid. We don't need alot of things to be happy and so don't see a need to chase material things that add to stress.
We currently stay in a 3rm HDB and are moving to 5rm since baby #2 is coming in Oct, so we need more bedrooms.
At the start of our house hunting journey, I honestly felt like you too! Because our income was not low, we didn't qualify for subsidy.
We're also not well off enough to afford private housing comfortably without stressing about monthly instalments. Private housing is out of the qn for us in the foreseeable years because I don't want to put extra stress on my husband and we also see no need to stay private. I think it's the inside of the house that matters, not the outside, since we spend most of the time at home, not in the function room or swimming pool.
When choosing our new 5rm resale flat, our key considerations were location, to be close to extended family. But that meant we had to continue to stay in mature estate where HDB prices are crazy. 5rm or EA flats around the area is at least $700-$800k onwards..
Both of us didn't want to pay this much for a 99yr lease. As we are also skeptical how much we'll be able to sell it for in future.
So to combat this, we looked at older units and low floor. It helped that my husband prefers low floor, and I liked that older units are bigger.
After more than 15 viewings, and months scrolling on propertyguru, we finally found a flat from 1970s, 5rm, mature estate, low floor, at less than $600k, with a greenery view at the balcony.
I think it's entirely possible to find something comfortable within your budget so that u don't have to postpone plans just to save up for that ideal property at sky high prices.. You just have to go for many many viewings, so that u can find something that's acceptable to both of u.
If you would like advice, don't let housing or lack of push back your marriage plans. My big regret is not having kids earlier. I had my first baby at 33. Second one is coming in a few months at 35. I feel tired and old already.. But we still want to try for baby #3, as my husband and I are both only children so we know it gets lonely.
My husband and I got married in our late 20s. At that time he was still studying, but we didn't want to wait for BTO and too broke to buy resale. So we rented a 1 bedroom condo at $1.5k per month, which was very affordable. But that was the rental market years ago, i don't know what it is like now. Maybe u can consider renting a cheap / affordable place in the meantime to start settling down.. After 1yr rental, my husband graduated and we bought our first 3rm resale flat and have stayed here till now.
We also didn't have a lavish wedding/ proposal / diamond ring. We don't see the need for all these. So it also helped to save money and put it into longer term things..
However, I do have to agree with u about renovation costs! Now that I'm embarking on the reno journey myself, prices are crazy.
Because our new flat is so old, we really can't keep anything. It needs a complete redo of floor tiles, electrical, lighting, toilets, kitchen.. Really everything. We're not even looking at elaborate carpentry or anything very fancy, our 3 quotes have come back ranging from $75k- $120k. And this is just renovation cost, not including appliances, aircon and furniture!
I find this really unbelievable. I'm still persevering to find more reasonable quotes. I will not spend $100k on reno, it's crazy. I think $60k is probably our max, but we haven't found that yet, still working on it...
Good luck to you on your house hunting. Don't give up on HDB, not everything is $1mil.. $1mil is usually for penthouse unit but do you really need that to be happy? Take time to find, you'll surely find something you both like.
Also, your first house likely won't be your last. So don't need to go all the way to $1mil immediately. Because it's the first time you will be staying on your own, there's alot of things you will need to experience to know if you will actually like it.. So no need to max out on your first home yet.
Like for us, we were so noob choosing our first hdb, we only went to view in the night after work. So we didn't know it was so dark. It doesn't have natural light coming in as it is blocked by opposite block and is a corridor unit so I even have to turn on lights in the day!
But we'll chalk it down to first timer mistake. So for all our subsequent houses, we know clearly what we want / can live with and what we absolutely cannot and we're able to make better decisions..
One last thought, maybe don't go private la, i imagine it must be very stressful to carry such a big loan on your shoulders at this early stage, esp if u say both of you have not much savings yet . But that's just me.

58900,103714,"I fell for a Siam bu.
Before u guys judge me, please hear me out. I often frequent Thai disco / Siam Diu as a means to de-stress. I find that the loud music and spinning lights help take the stress away from my work.
Like any other visit, I sat at my usual spot when a petite silhouette from afar caught my attention. Her round eyes, sharp nose, and elongated legs is what many would consider ""attractive"". Not to mention that her long and silky hair that is constantly brushing against her shoulder line; any man would subconsciously gravitate toward her and I was no exception.
I could not help but to glance in her direction without making it too obvious. I got caught eventually and we exchanged eye contact for a good 10 seconds. She understood the assignment and came over for a chat. As we began sharing more about each other, I realized that we have many things in common. We immediately clicked as though we had known each other right from the beginning. She introduced herself as ""Moon.""
At that moment, I felt as though I had found my soulmate. Talking to Moon made me forget about my fatigue from work. It was as though time had stopped. Deep down, I was sincerely hoping that the conversation could last forever. Time flew quickly, and before I knew it, the place was closing for the night. We exchanged contact and parted ways.
The next day, my phone rang. On answering, I was greeted by a familiar voice. It was Moon. My face lit up knowing that I could connect with her again. We agreed to meet up at a Thai restaurant called NaNa at Golden mille.
NaNa restaurant is a famous Thai restaurant in SG. Moon claimed to be a frequent patron of the place as their food tasted close to home. She even use the opportunity to teach me the name of the dishes in Thai. Halfway through our meal, she was rudely interrupted by a phone call which led her to leaving the restaurant. She claimed that she had something urgent to attend to, and needed to excuse herself. She sounded anxious.
Feeling concerned, I quickly paid the tab and followed her. I was soon led to one of the floor exits where I found her seated on the stairs and sobbing uncontrollably. I approached her to check on her. My presence caught her off guard and, almost immediately, she apologized for leaving me alone in the restaurant. She then went on to explain what happened. Turns out, her mom was terminally ill, and needed money for her operation. Sympathizing with her plight, I agreed to help her out without much hesitation.
As I was about to get up and make the withdrawal. She grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her. She gave me a peck on my cheek to express her gratitude. Things got heated up and we made love in a public space. Despite the shabby location, the sex was good and memorable. The day ended on a good note with her settling her family matters with my financial support.
That incident pulled us closer as we started hanging out more. Despite numerous warnings from my friends and family about her intention, I chose to believe her as I felt that the society perception towards hostress is based on stereotypes. Things, however, did get dubious when she started asking for more money...
P.S I realized the story is getting too lengthy and I apologized. I'll split the story and post the part two if the post hits 200 likes

57879,101745,"I am married twice and I have learnt so much about maintaining a marriage from a woman's POV.
1st marriage, I was young and over zealous about being a good wife and living a good marriage. We were a horrible match, but I believed I could make it work. There was always a need to prove to everyone that I made the right choice.
I did everything that social media would deem as the perfect woman - including cook, clean, work, bring home money, plan, love his family, do home improvement projects, romance the husband, keep up with the s** and whatever you can think of. Eventually I got burnt out and he took me for granted. Can I blame him? Yes but I am also to blame because I made him into who he is.
He hated my guts because I was so good. He criticised me because he hated the compliments I got. He hated it when I see his friends because I stole his limelight. He didn't need to do anything because his wife could do everything. In my POV, I was just trying to be the best for him but in his POV, I was putting him down in every way. So like most marriage tragedies, he cheated on me with a woman who was so ordinary, so ordinary that it opened my eyes completely. I had been working blindly to become what I thought is a good woman - but was it for him? Or was it just for my own ego? I went through a phase of blaming and hating on him because I was self righteous about being the best - and yet I was hurt so badly. But now I am thankful because that failed marriage has taught me so much.
My current marriage made me realise that if you meet the right person, you don't even need to try so hard or work so hard. We know each other's strengths and we give each other space. Of course we have days when we are just pissed at each other but we choose our battles. I have the brains and he has the muscles so I do most of family and kids planning while he does the physical labor like cleaning and fixing. He will play his games and watch his sports but still be responsible for the chores at home. I go out partying with my girlfriends but still return home to be a good partner the next day. We respect each other's activities and hobbies. We are always verbal about our appreciation for one another. It is harmonious and great for the kids because I see them growing up being good people.
The biggest lesson I learnt is that - if you have issues with a man before marriage, don't marry him, wait for the one who makes you feel good about yourself and brings out the best of you. The right man will not hurt you and will appreciate you for what you have. It will hurt him to hurt you. You don't have to try to make things work, it will just work. When you realise you are trying too hard, something is very wrong!

57717,101452,"I am a 19F local dating a China guy with a really curious trait. Whenever he has trouble remembering how to pronounce cheem-sounding English words, he will transliterate it into Chinese and memorize that instead. For instance, ""s**ual intercourse"" becomes ""谁输儿 阴特扣死“ (shei-shu-er yin-te-kou-si), which I find so funny I make him say it every time he wants to do it.
But yesterday when I was helping him to spring-clean his room for CNY, I stumbled upon this army notebook of his. I recall that he told me as a second-gen PRC he had to serve, and he was a Platoon Sergeant, so I was curious and had a look at what he wrote. Lo and behold, it was full of Chinese transliterations of army commands and on one page, there was a full-blown Tang dynasty-esque poem:

巴黎死色囊地利 (ba-li-si-se-nang-di-li)

58541,103048,"I have been an independent girl, I solve my own problems on my own.
Upon graduation, you won't believe how many people get into companies based on who they know, not what they know. Their relatives are connections which they depend on to secure employment. I am different. I did two internships, and every time holidays rolled around, I'd get myself a part time job. so through interviews and a few professional exams. I got my job offers. With absolutely no help from my family at all.
Then came convocation. I walked around empty handed when my friends carried teddy bears, balloons and flowers till their arms couldn't hold any more. Their parents, aunts and uncles each contributed to a convocation gift. Me? Nobody bought me anything. Unfazed, I decided not to whine or even hint to my family they ought to get me something. I marched up to the gift counter and bought my own convocation gifts with my own hard-earned money. I felt extremely proud of myself for being so self reliant. I don't rely upon my family like a crutch. I stand on my own two feet and get what I want with no assistance.
On my birthday, my clique didn't know. Cuz I sort of didn't publicise my birthday when I was in ntu. My parents knew and got me only a simple blouse. I don't think anyone else knew, or cared enough to throw me a surprise party or bombard me with gifts. Other people had Facebook walls flooded with birthday wishes, tables flooded with gifts, and phones flooded with birthday messages. I didn't feel upset. I can't be unloved unless I don't love myself, I can't receive no presents unless I don't give one to myself. I don't buy the idea that I need to extort gifts from my family. I don't burden them.
So I bought birthday presents for myself. I got myself an ice cream cake, earrings and heels. No one is here to stop me from getting things with my own hands.
It's not just in NTU that I learnt to be independent. it started in my earlier days, where everybody else got rewards for doing well in their a level exams except for me.
I hope everyone who reads this learn to find their own happiness by working on their own. The choice is yours.

57856,101703,"I read here about marriage proposals that went wrong - guys not putting in enough effort etc. But marriage is so much more than just a proposal... there are so many other factors to consider.
I will tell you after 21 years of marriage... don't marry unless you are very sure.
We went to pre-marital workshops talk about anything under the sun. Talking is easy.
Doing chores, having kids, and even having s** is difficult.
Firstly, we had never even gone travelling alone before marriage, never stayed together at all before marriage.
It's ok if both parties are serious about making it work..however sadly people change. I feel like I ended up getting a shock. My hubby has never cooked nor has ever done a day of chores in his life.
We didn't even know how to have s**. We needed to read books about it.
We didn't even know that we both have fertility issues. We took three years to have our first child with clomid and 6 years to have our kids via ivf.
And when it came to kids - the person who usually ends up giving up their job to take care of them is the women. So the hubby who had promised to have a joint account at the start of the marriage suddenly decided to have an individual account.
Suddenly you realise all the promises of your money is my money and my money is your money is all nonsense... he changed. Knowing he is the sole breadwinner, he decides how much to give you and he keeps his own account from you.
He bought his ""own car"", changed his job to do anything he wants as he has his own money.
Suddenly, after 21 years of marriage, you realised you had sacrificed so much for the family (inhections, iui, ivf) but your husband acts like a single man.
He enjoys playing with the kids, but disciplining them and managing their studies, their handphone usage, their meals... all lies on your shoulders.
He continues to game and does not help with chores. He even continues watching p*rn as if he was single.
Then you realised - why did you even marry in the first place?
The diamond, the promises that he will continue to love and protect you and do all the chores are just nothing but lies.
He just enjoys the fact that he has a family so he won't be lonely. But other than that, he continues his single lifestyle.
So ladies, please open your eyes big big... don't look at the proposal, don't look at the diamond, the bank account, the house, the car, the degree.
Know if he is the guy you can spend the rest of your life with. As he is now, not what you hope he will be.
We are usually maternal and might give up everything for our family.
If given another chance... I would rather wait till I find a more suitable guy who truly loves me and keeps the marriage vows, than someone who will only keep the vows if you don't disturb his gaming or interfere with his money.

57685,101379,"I am an insurance agent. So many negative and hilarious posts about my job. Thought I'll offer another perspective to some people who are considering joining.
My credentials: I am under 30, in this line for years, quarter-million annual taxable income, MDRT and all the other awards, blah blah blah....
1. Do not underestimate the privilege of having no liabilities & responsibilities.
I joined this line at 21, and only needed to take care of myself financially. This means I could afford to earn only $12k a year back then while building my career slowly and organically. Treating every day working as a learning opportunity rather than being super despo to close the sale. Those desperate to close the sale usually fail because consumers are not idiots. Then it becomes a vicious cycle, no sale = no money = more despo. Trust me, you will earn like shit the first few years. That's normal. Those ""successful"", ""young"" agents that earn money ""fast"" are liars. There are so many dirty tricks in this industry to con the consumers. If you know you know.
2. Literally get good at money.
So many agents only call themselves ""investment specialists"" but can only sell their companies' ILP. That's bullshit. I know so many junior agents that do not even have a brokerage account and whatever issues the client has, ILP will always be the answer. While you are earning like shit, you should invest your own money and be legit good. Attend courses like CFA, CFP, ChFC, Certified Private Banking etc and APPLY the knowledge learnt. Do your own investments, talk to doctors to be aware of medical trends, be extremely familiar with all the different hospitals processes. Personally, I have certain qualifications and run my own investment holdings company, hence clients trust my advice more than some XMM in a LV bag talking about why her ILP is the best.
3. Network like f***.
Consumers can buy insurance online and this trend will increase in the future. So what is the agent's value proposition? I am the problem solver. Need some free legal advice? I can set up an informal dinner with my lawyer clients. Need a medical appt soon, I can bypass the long waiting time and set one for you within 3 days. Need to divorce your spouse? I know many private investigators and dirty tricks to increase your chances of winning. Need car mechanics and workshops? I get kickbacks from the shops and pass it to you as a form of savings. Need renovators and interior designers? I know people. Wanna get a job in IB (JP, UBS, Morgan Stanley etc), I know people, lemme set up a lunch. This network is exclusive to paying customers only, not even my extended family or friends have access to it, unless they are paying customers. The more the customers pay, the more priority you get in my network. So, it becomes a bidding war among customers and it makes good business sense.
That's all. You can earn a lot in this career, but it is all blood sweat and tears. Young naive people also quite dumb ah, you think can just suka suka earn $100K fresh out of school, with no qualifications meh? There is always a price to pay, hope this enlightens people out there.
Maybe I shall do a confession exposing how agents appear successful? and churning practices? hahahahaha

58125,102269,"Subject: 50-50 Split in Relationship
I have been hearing about the so called general norms of setting up a joint acc and contribute to the said account for the expenses etc based on your income. Each couple has different arrangements. Let me share mine..
My husband has been working in financial industry with senior positions, hence he brings more income for our household. Since our dating time,I have asked him what his preference is. Setting up a joint account and contributing x percentage according to our income? He proceeded to tell me that he will take care of all the bills and expenses. Let me keep my portion of salary (at this point of time, we never went for BTO as he already purchased his own property).
And yeah we proceeded to do that. He paid all the household bills,groceries,car n house installments, even my online shopping bills, meal with my friends, all those big expenses like hospital bills and insurance plans. He said that since he earns way more,let him take care of me as it is his duty as a guy and as a head of family. He said he is looking for a wife and future mother of his kids, not a business partner, so why need to calculate so much? He asked me to keep my salary and encouraged me to keep working in order to have a sense of financial freedom, building my self confidence and to enhance my personal growth as well as networking. As a husband, he's going to be my pillar of support and I can always rely on him emotionally and financially. He is also giving me a small amount of monthly allowance as a token of appreciation.
Now that we have a baby, I have quit my job since I cannot bear to be away from my baby, but I feel guilty for not working. Nevertheless, he told me that it does not matter, he will support my family's monthly allowance (I'm still giving monthly allowance to my fam btw) on top of providing me with extra allowance. Of course our savings will shrink, but he said why so calculative?His money is my money too. I have contributed a lot by being a mother to our baby, and he feels sorry for not being able to spend more time to take care of our baby due to his busy work schedule. He said I have worked hard and contribute so much in giving birth and sacrificing my careet in order to raise our baby, so he is doing the minimum he can do as a husband.
I know every couple has their own arrangement..nothing is wrong or right, it really depends on their own circumstances and level of comfort. I really appreciate my husband as I know he is rare in the market (even all my friends told me so). What works for me may not work for others and vice versa. In return, what I provided to my husband is respect and prudence. I let him have his financial freedom and discourage him from making big purchases like buying branded goods for me or fancy car or posh private property. I'd rather he channel his cash for investment and saving plans. I'd rather not burden our finance by insisting to purchase fancy house or car for ""face"", but to do it when we can very comfortably afford the loan installments.
That being said, every couple has different definition of being ""calculative"". I'm sharing mine as I would like to say that, husband will not lose anything by contributing more if they can afford to. Afterall,a wife will turn your house to home, carry your baby for 9 months, breastfeed and nurture your family, all while working as well. Can these being split 50-50 also? Down the road, there are roles which will continue to grow between husband and wife. I want my daughter to have a financial independence to build a family, but I also wish for her husband to treat her like what her daddy treats me. As such, I would also like my son to treat his future wife like how his father is treating his mother.
Selflessness will trigger sincerity and gratitude. A little goes a long way :)
P.s. for singles, do not give up on looking for a partner that wholeheartedly loves and respects you. I found mine on dating apps :) hehe, thank you for reading. Have a good day!

58582,103120,"All these advice about asking men to go gym, workout, pick up a sport, stay buff, just to increase your chance of getting a girl. You know how it makes fat people who can't slim down feel?
I'm fat ok. I have a pot belly and I'm not even 30. I try to exercise but I work really long hours, sometimes I just want to go straight to sleep when I get home. I eat whatever is served to me at work so I cannot afford to be choosy as I don't want to pack cold lunch boxes. I eat whatever my mother cooks because I am not a picky eater. I wear glasses and didn't get contact lenses or want to do lasik. I hang out with a lot of older people due to my job. So I really have not much chance to meet girls. Sometimes they joke about helping to matchmake me with their daughter or niece. I never took their offer seriously.
I know this girl from another friend. I find her very pretty. She works in the beauty industry so she is always well groomed. We spent a lot of time messaging before meeting in person. I grew to like her but I was worried because I can tell she is barely half my size. I didn't want her to meet me out of pity so I didn't ask her out a second time. We continued to message each other often. I really enjoyed talking to her. The next time we met with another friend in tow. She asked me why didn't I ask her out and she wanted me to accompany her to this place after we split with our friend. I guess I didn't get the hint as I thought she only thought of me as a friend. She held my hand and told me she like me.
Now I'm happily attached for the last 6 months to this gorgeous girl. I'm sure she didn't fall in love with my pot belly first. I met her parents and they accepted me. She's not a princess, she is very understanding and kind hearted. My parents approve of her too.
I don't earn a lot, I'm not good looking, I'm not a smooth talker. But I'm genuine to her. So don't give up guys. There is always someone out there for someone like you.

57425,100810,"Recently, my department welcomed a fresh grad. When asked if this is his first job, he said no. He was actually from an e-commerce company but left the organisation. I didn't probe too much into the details of his leaving. But I would just like to say that it's ok for fresh grads to feel pressured and stressed when they first start to work. It's also ok to see them leave their first job within a matter of months. In fact, it's normal. I too, was a classic case of leaving my first job after several months due to some matters.
Why is it ok? Fresh grads tend to have this mindset of what their ideal job should be. They aim and strive to create that perfect picture in their first job. But reality isn't always the case and setbacks and disappointments ensue, which cause them to leave the work. It's actually good, because now they know that the line of work doesn't really suit them, be it people, responsibilities or company vision, mission. Since they are young, they are able to bear a bit of the loss and search for another job.
If they get another offer, good for them. If they don't, then it's time to search hard. And this is also a lesson for them. To cherish and realise that their ideal job is not as realistic as they thought it to be. Then in their next line of work, they would be able to put aside such thoughts and focus.
People who think that these fresh grads are strawberry or durian generation. No they are not. They are just normal human beings that are still trying their best to navigate the working world, one that is already being ruled by laojiaos who set the rules as and how they want them to be, and these young people have no choice but to get used to it.
So let's not judge them and instead, support them. Teach them the things they need to do their work. Don't know much excel skills (most grads I know really know a few basics only because in uni, who uses excel often? It's all R, Python, Solidworks, Matlab, Arduino), teach them what you use.
They don't talk during department lunches. That's fine. It's their way to assimilate and trying to be a part of the group. Initiate conversations with them, get them to talk about themselves. And please, after a few months, there's really no need for department lunches. Sometimes, even I want my own time to just rest my head on the table in silence instead of faking smiles at the kopitiam table. Let them do their own things during lunch. You never know, they might be watching a drama that you are watching too. More things to talk about.
To all young and fresh grads, know that you are not alone, this guy here typing, and many others out there were just like y'all. Learn and absorb. Blend in well without losing yourselves. And always be courteous and reasonable, and pass down this attitude to the next generation of new people. Because like you, they will need your support.

58213,102441,"A lot of men like to complain that their wives & gfs have low s** drives, that they’re “never in the mood for s**”.
Well guess what? Most women enjoy s**. We LIKE s**. But only when we are feeling comfortable, happy and in a good headspace.
The problem with men is that they’re only affectionate & sweet only when they’re trying to get laid. When a man starts touching or kissing me, he’s not doing it to be sweet & affectionate, we both know he’s trying to get into my pants.
I’m currently involved with someone, and I absolutely detest having s** with him. He’s overall a decent man, but he always makes it blatantly obvious that he EXPECTS s** whenever we spend time together. It’s the expectation that turns me off.
Some days when I was totally not in the mood, or I got my period etc; and I say no. He reacted very negatively to this- his reaction ranging from sulking & huffing & sighing loudly next to me, to throwing tantrums and banging doors, banging things around, vocally expressing all his frustrations.
But whenever he gets to have s**, he’s all sweet & nice again. Wow manipulative much?
Like seriously if u start behaving like an asshole the minute my legs aren’t open for you, that’s when your true colors come out, and I lose all respect for you.
I think I speak for most women when I say it’s a huge turn off when a man behaves like he’s entitled to my body. Like hello, I already grant you access to my body on a regular basis, and I have the right to say no to you occasionally when I’m not in the mood or not well. My body is not a all-you-can-eat buffet.
So now, I totally have lost all my s** drive. I am dead & numb from the waist down. Whenever he wants s**, I just give in because it’s easier than dealing with his f***ing toddler tantrums. I just lie there like a dead fish and wait for it to be over. To be honest sometimes I even feel like I’m being used; and I feel so damn resentful towards him.
I can’t wait to dump him and never have s** with a man again. He totally ruined my drive with his behavior. Absolutely appalling and disgusting. He’s made something that was supposed to be enjoyable into something that feels like a chore.
So guys. If your other half doesn’t seem to be in the mood, PLEASE don’t force it. The worst thing you can do is react badly to her saying no, by reacting aggressively or even passive aggressively. Don’t even try to be subtle with a sour attitude. We can sense it.
All we want to hear is, “It’s okay baby.. we don’t need to have s** today if you’re not feeling up to it. Let’s just chill okay?” It’s that simple.
S** is so much more enjoyable when the other party is not SO hung up about whether he’s getting laid; and he just wants to spend time with me. If a man were to just offer me a back rub or foot rub after a long day without expecting anything in return, I think there’s a high chance I’ll actually want to jump him.
A man who can fully respect boundaries and our bodily autonomy is rare; and that quality makes a man so attractive tbh.
A man who can be affectionate, and touch me in non-s**ual way, is so much hotter than a desperate man who’s like constantly trying to burrow his way into my pants every single time he’s near me. Ew.

58088,102201,"Just a rant from the spouse of a junior doctor.
My husband goes to work daily before 5am and only ends work after 7.30pm. Sometimes, he does 30h to 32h calls which is from 5.30am till 1pm the next day. He works more than 100h a week when the contract says not more than 80h. He works both weekends and once worked 20 days consecutively. It is common to work for 14 days in a row and I have heard some horror stories of his friends working 30 days straight without a day off. He doesn't reflect his true working hours in the system as if you get caught for working more than 100h, they won't investigate why you overworked, they will investigate why YOU overworked. Thus, to avoid all the troubles, it is a common practise to under report the actual working hours.
My husband doesn't bring home much. His starting pay is $4k before CPF deduction and with all the on-calls and weekend half-days, that brings maximum another extra $1k - $1.5k. Is $5k justifiable for >400h of work per month? I don't think so.
They have no time and energy for their loved ones. He comes home late and usually will continue reading up until he falls asleep at his desk. We hardly date because he has to work and albeit saying that he is not tired and he can go on a date with me, I know he is and I'll prefer to let him sleep in. We have been delaying our wedding because he is too busy and we are still saving up.
Will MOH wake up their idea? No, that's why healthcare workers get claps and not a better working system.

58663,103277,"I came from a humble family. Went to neighbourhood school. Barely made it to NTU. I studied hard and got a prestigious scholarship to for PhD studies in NUS. At this point, I had a little fame. Many people know me for my intelligence. Many people said I would be genius one day and be very successful.
Then when I graduated, by chance, I befriended upper class people and learned a lot about being wealthy. It seems my path in life was set, until the Netflix documentary, Surviving Death, appeared. Using that as a stepping stone, I researched deeply into the spiritual world, and found out that we are spiritual beings here to on Earth to learn unconditional love. Nothing else matters. Neither status nor material wealth. That our souls was involved in the planning of our lives before we are born. Who we meet, the parents we will have, the careers we will have. Many things were planned. All we have to do is to trust a higher power and do good and be good.
Now my focus in life has changed, from achieving social status and wealth, to serving people and bringing joy to others. I enjoy donating money randomly to the needy. I also take a lot of effort to reduce the amount of waste other people generate.

57426,100814,"Do you ever think about your ex partner and wonder how they're doing?
For the record, I'm happily married, with a beautiful baby girl. My husband is loving, everything I could have ever wished for. My life is complete, beyond my dreams and I'm really grateful..
But today, while putting my baby girl to sleep, I suddenly realized that it must have been roughly 10 years since my first boyfriend had broken up with me. (My husband is my second)
I started to wonder how this first guy is. Not in a romantic kind of way but genuine concern as someone who had known him very well in the past.
You see, he's not a bad guy. At all. He just has all the bad luck. And I do wonder how he is from time to time, though I've no desire to get in contact. I genuinely hope things have looked up for him since.
The circumstances of our breakup was dramatic, though it was none of our fault. He's just plain unlucky.
We had been together about 5 years, throughout university, but he broke up with me the first year after we graduated and started working.
The following can probably be written into a mediacorp drama:
His family had always been fraught with problems. They're a working class family, with total of 4 brothers. He is no. 2. They could have had a good, middle class life but his father gambled to the point of having loanshark come to the house and to the office, causing him to lose his job.
Then his parents divorced, selling the flat to split assets. His father then became homeless, and my then boyfriend who was still in uni, had to fork out few hundreds a month from his part time tuition income to rent a bed for his dad.
I pitied him having to support his dad while the rest of his family moved to a HDB rental flat. By this time the other brothers had stopped contact with his dad, only my ex boyfriend was supporting him.
Wanting to save on university fees, he deliberately loaded on more modules so he could graduate a semester earlier and go to work to earn money to support his dad and family, with 2 younger brothers who were still schooling.
The last straw came one day when I was at work. By that time I had just started working a few months, so he could have been working for a year already.
I still remember I received a text from him, asking to meet me that night after work. I had period cramps and really wanted to go home to rest so I asked if we could meet another night. But no, he had something urgent to tell me. So we met at my void deck.
I still remember that night. He sat me down and told me everything...
He wanted to break up with me. Because his youngest brother, then in sec 3, had been kicked out of school for failing to turn up for the retake of his end of year exam. Yes, so he had failed once and had been retained. The school gave him another chance to come back for re-exam but in between, he had gone to lion dance, fallen and broken his collar bone, meaning he couldn't take the re exam since he couldn't write. So the school had called to kick him out. That was the last straw for my ex bf as his problems seemed unending and which led to his decision to break up with me.
Incredulous? The whole situation was incredulous to me. I cried and cried and cried. I didn't understand why it was me who had to suffer a break up when we both agreed I wasn't a problem to him.
He then told me everything else. He said he didn't want to burden me with all his family's problems so he had kept alot of the severity of the problems to himself.
But during the break up, he came clean and told me everything that had been plaguing him.
By that time, I hadn't seen his eldest brother for months. I did ask, but my then bf just made excuses. Only during the break up did he tell me that his elder brother had been caught taking drugs and had been either in jail or rehab (I can't rmb). I was shocked and so pained for him. This meant that he could no longer continue to work in insurance after his release, and the burden on my ex bf to support the family became even heavier.
He also told me, when his parents divorced and sold the flat, they split proceeds, and his dad went uncontactable for a week, apparently he had gone to Batam to gamble and came back after he lost heavily or most of it.
So yeap up until that point, I had been blissfully unaware of the severity of his family's problems and only knew that they divorced due to his gambling problem and that only my ex bf was supporting his dad by renting a bed space for him to stay.
I was stunned. And sad. We had talked about BTO, visited the show flat, discussed applying for the one at AMK etc. Everybody including me, thought we would end up together because that's just how we were.
And then as I sat crying and wailing, he told me he decided to break up with me because I was always a happy girl and he didn't want to burden me with his problems. So he didn't tell me alot of these things that plagued him. But when he had to meet me, he had to put up a happy front and he didn't want to anymore.
I was bewildered because yes im sheltered, but I'm not unhelpful or uncaring. I didn't understand why he had to hide his problems from me.
When his dad was homeless, I even suggested he move in with my own dad so as to save on rent.
My parents were and are separated, my dad stays alone in a house. So there was room for his dad. He did move in, but my dad is not easy-going. He has OCD and is very x100 naggy. So anyway, things didn't work out between the dads and his dad had a fall in the house and was warded and later diagnosed with kidney failure and needed dialysis.
Anyway so we broke up that night but I was distraught and kept pestering him, stalking him at his house and workplace to force him to speak to me. I even contemplated jumping off his block, while sitting on the stairs in between knocking on his door for him to speak to me.
Eventually he told me, please stop knocking on my door. I feel very stressed, it reminds me of times when the loanshark came to our house.
It took me more than a year, and a few months of severe pimple outbreak before I got over the heartbreak. I had pimple outbreak from excessively crying, it dried out my face or caused some hormonal changes and at age 25, I had my first outbreak.
My turning point came when I was overseas with a group of girl friends doing community work. After activities one day, they took us out fishing for lala in the river. It was evening time. As I floated lazily down the river, I looked up and suddenly saw that the sky was round. I can't put it in words, but the sky was so vast and clear.. clouds dotted the sky. I could see it was indeed round. And I thought to myself: The world is so big, there's still so many things I haven't seen and done, so many things waiting for me..
In that moment, I was filled with hope and excitement for the future and stopped looking back on my past. It took another few months for my pimples to die down.. I discovered the vegetarian diet helped calm my hormones and pimples down.
My healing really came after this river trip. I started doing alot of things on my own, like cycling from ECP to Changi Point or Barrage every weekend. Going to swim 20 laps. All on my own. It was very empowering because I had never been a very independent person.
And then about a year after the break up, my colleagues encouraged me to start dating again. They told me about online dating. Actually my director was the one who told me about it. That's where he met his wife. So I did, and then I met my future husband. We dated for 2 years and have been married for 5 years now.
Anyway, I am just writing to put this on the internet, and putting it out there that I hope this first guy is well and found someone he deserves. I hope things have gone better for him and his family and I sincerely wish them the very best. I keep him in my thoughts quite frequently, like once every few months I would wonder if he's ok.
I mean, after all he has been through, I hope god is treating him better now.
Oh, actually we did meet about 2 years after the breakup. Purely by coincidence. My grandma had been warded in hospital and so was his dad. My cousins bumped into him and told him about grandma, who he also knew. So he messaged me after that to ask her condition. That's the first time we spoke after so long, I was already dating my husband. Anyway long story short, his dad passed away from kidney failure shortly after and I also visited his funeral. I felt really guilty at that time because I had blamed our breakup on his dad too. Anyway that was the last time we spoke.
End of story, it was long.

58562,103091,"I am the op of #102588. My mother had an affair with a married man and gave birth to me.
The search for my biological father didn't take long because the company he works for still exists. Turns out one of his children works there now. This person was willing to meet me.
My biological father actually passed away not long ago. They all knew about my existence but out of respect for their mother, they stopped short of locating me. He said his father actually had a few pictures of me throughout the years. I am aware my mother didn't send him any photos of me so I assume he had checked me out on his own.
He said he was expecting to hear from me, he just didn't know when. He insisted he did not hate me because I did not ask to be born. We even tried to compare our appearance by taking a few photos together. He made me feel comfortable during our awkward meet up. He has this friendly and warm aura which I think should be the same like my biological father. He did not say much about his family's reaction about me so I guess not everyone knew or wanted to hear from me. He asked me questions about myself. He asked if I lived well as a child then he said I must have done great because I'm a sensible adult now. He said if I needed to look for a job he can help. He also asked about my mother and wished her well.
I had prepared a list of questions of things I wanted to know and he answered almost all of them, including giving me some information about their family medical history. Those that were unanswered he promised to find out. He also handed me a few photos of my biological father. When we said our good byes he insisted we keep in touch. I wasn't hopeful because I don't want to assume he had accepted me as his half sibling. We added each other on fb.
When I got home, we all hugged and I cried. I feel this huge weight and tension lifted off my body but I also feel bad for causing my family distress. Especially my mother. I promised my stepdad he is my dad no matter what happens and I asked him to forgive me for insisting on my search. They are relieved it turned out ok. I'm not sure if I will continue to keep in touch with my half sibling. For now, I feel this odd sense of content to have some answers as well as loss for a man that I've never met. I will never know if he had ever wanted to meet me or not. I hope in time, I will be able to let go of this thought.

58536,103052,"Marriage is just a piece of paper or is it not?
I met this guy. He was perfect. He checked all the boxes of being an eligible bachelor. It was love at first sight for the both of us. We met each other at a friend's party and got together soon after.
A few months into the relationship we started to talk about us. He felt he is not marriage or kids material but he loves me a lot and can see a future with me. He was very clear about this and wanted me to understand before we continue. At that time he also suggested that we get a place together. Eventually he ended up getting a place on his own and I moved in with him. He told me I need not pay anything but I contributed by paying some of the bills and minor house expenses. I felt I was very much in love with him that a part of me believe I can forsake marriage as long as we are happy together. Besides I dislike children myself.
We are not married but we lived like a married couple. We cook for each other, did chores, managed the bills, visited each other's parents and we did everything together. I thought we had the perfect life. We lived like we are married and yet we have the time to date each other. I was envied by friends who witnessed our love. He still buys me flowers and gifts on special days like anniversaries, after being together for 10 years.
The final few months of our relationship I sensed his increasing distance. I convinced myself we are just busy with work and other things. He was out more, he stopped telling me about his day. It got to a point I felt we were like roommates living under the same roof. Then he told me he met someone. He needed me to move out because the other woman wants to move in.
I haven't had time to compose myself and react to this utter betrayal and I had to pack up. 10 years meant nothing to him?.. I moved back to my parents and lied to them that his place is under construction.
I haven't even had time to process my anger and grief then I heard he had a vehicle accident. His parents wasn't aware that we broke up so I was called first. I found out he was severely injured that his life won't be the same forever. The other woman didn't hesitate to dump him after seeing his condition.
Since his parents didn't know we had broken up, I choose to pretend I'm still his gf and stayed with him at the hospital. I took over most of the caregivers job because he was so helpless. I stayed over at his place often and took care of him for a while. He couldn't carry on with his current job anymore so he had to settle for a simpler job which pays lesser. The lucky thing is he had almost paid off the house so he didn't need to downgrade.
He had been needy towards me since the accident. I can understand that. How can I not feel for him? We did have a lot of happy times till this happened. I continued being there for him as he needed a lot of help and support. One day he asked me if I wanted to get married. I realised this was what I wanted all along. But not like this. I said no and realised it is time to leave him. I didn't want to take care of him anymore. So I left.
Now, I'm already past the age of having kids safely. I did try to move on. I tried to date but without much success. I met 2 who were quite persistent in chasing me. But none interest me or can even compare to him. I've got my own place during the time I was taking care of him. I think a part of me already know I won't get back together with him. I just needed a push to move on with my own life. Did I regret not getting married when I was younger? Definitely. I may have lived a very different life if I walked away the moment he told me he is not marriage material. If he cheated while we are married maybe he wouldn't have got hurt because I may not have moved out so easily.
Without a marriage certificate, it's very easy to walk away when things happen. So what kind of a person did I wanted to be? One who walks away or one who stays because of a piece of paper?

58689,103318,"So I finally crossed paths with my ex at my workplace after 3 years. Since we parted ways I've always wondered how I would react to her reappearance again. All I did, quite pathetically, was tapped on her shoulder and uttered a measly ""hi"". Even as I walked away, my heart was pounding frantically, as if back to the first time we met after my fateful confession.
She was my first love and every shade the dream girlfriend as a teenager I yearned to have. We were also our class' model couple, and received heaps of marriage invitations as if everyone expected us to pull it off eventually. We were also inseparable throughout secondary school and JC; she was there through the lowest points in my life, and so was I for hers. But as it turned out, we grew apart and ultimately went our separate ways.
As far as I know, she's relishing a life of familial bliss now, married and happily raising a son - a future we had once envisioned as a couple. To be honest, I'm just a tad little envious, but mostly happy that she realised her dream. As of me, it has been a rough journey since 3 years ago. The gaping hole that she left behind remains to be filled. There is this girl I met in CCA that caught my attention, but for reasons unbeknownst even to myself I haven't been able to summon enough courage to even strike up a conversation with her, much less start a new relationship. Once bitten, twice shy, perhaps?
To all budding, first-time couples out there: don't be afraid to devote your all in a relationship. Even if it doesn't work out in the end, you would have written a exhilarating chapter in your life - that of first love. There will be countless regrets, and I dare say, they are even inevitable. But the one thing not matched by subsequent relationships is the naive, innocent and pure romanticisation of love; a signpost you will look back later for guidance as you try to navigate romance in the harsh, real world.
To P, I'm thankful for everything. Really.

58638,103229,"I'm 21 this year. I've been with my boyfriend since JC1. I was 19 when I got pregnant. I chose to go for an abortion. I never told him about the baby or the abortion. I knew he would have wanted me to keep it. He was that kind of guy who would have done the right thing and taken responsibility. I wanted the baby too, but it was bad timing. He was in NS, due to start school in NUS, and I was already in NUS at the time. I made the decision to abort even though every fiber of my being told me not to. I paid a taxi driver $80 for his time and to make sure that I got home safe after the procedure.
Every year, on the 14th of August, today, I feel guilt and sadness. The kind that feels overwhelming that I find it hard to get through my day. Today, two years ago, was the day I got my abortion. I never knew my baby's gender, but I chose Sam for the name itself was ambiguous. I miss you so much, Sam, I'm so, so sorry. Not here, but loved and remembered all the same for the rest of my life.

58159,102358,"Reading so many posts about relationships and having my own share of experiences before finally finding someone to settle down. Been through 4 medium to long term (> 2 years) relationships. I'm married close to 20 years now.
I want to say this to those who are still seeking love.
If you have problems/issues that cannot be resolved or compromised while you are still bf/gf, the same problems will only get worse after marriage. When you are looking for certain qualities in a person, did you self reflect and see if you have anything to offer? Do you want to grow to become a better version of yourself? Do you have the potential to bring out the best in your partner? Do you want the best for your partner?
I recently had a reunion meet up with old friends and found out through them that 2 of my exes are still single after 20 years. The 3rd one divorced after being married for less than 5 years. I married my 4th bf.
All 3 relationships I left because I cannot imagine a future with the guy and there were issues that cannot be resolved. They did not possess qualities of being a reliable partner then. I don't know why they are still single now but I'm glad I moved on else I wouldn't have met my husband.
When I met my husband, he made me want to become a better version of me. It was not hard to love him at all. Like any couples, we have conflicts and disagreements but there was 1 distinct difference about him, he is a listener, he is patient and he can compromise when my request is reasonable. Because of that I start to behave more like him. I start to be more patient too. When I almost slipped back into my old princess ways he will lovingly talk to me and make me want to be a better person not just for him but also for myself. With a blink of an eye, we have spent 20 blissful years together. He became an even better man, better than I imagined, after we have children.
A relationship should not be turning your life upside down and making you question your worth in life.
A relationship should be a fulfilling one that makes you the best version of yourself. If you and your partner do not have this same goal in mind, being together will be hard. To those still looking for love, I hope you find that someone. If you want to meet a patient man, be a patient woman. If you want to meet a kind woman, be kind first.
If you date around with a certain kind of mentality, you are likely going to attract that and your thoughts will lead you to justify that negativity. Consider a setback a lesson that will make you a better person for the partner you have yet to met.
Good luck!

58303,102623,"Typing with a heavy heart. 10 years of relationship, 5 years of marriage, 3yo child, a husband whom I found was cheating on me with his colleague for the past 4 months. She filled up the gaps when my priorities were obviously on our child and house. I kept the house clean and tidy, ensuring they are both always fed during meal times, bought all necessities for the house. He paid for everything else for all the monthly household expenses, i never had to worry. But I neglected his mental needs. He wanted attention from me but knew I'm always attending to my needy toddler. Being athletic, he loves running he love outdoor activities. He was a doting husband no doubt. But he found himself getting more lonely. We have been talking since a few nights ago, tonight he finally opened up. He's not the type who speaks up when unhappy but I told him calmly I wanna listen to his thoughts, not what he wants to do to redeem his deeds. After 2 nights of confrontation, tonight I told him I can forgive but I'll never forget. I'll slowly pluck out that thorn and hope it will be filled with his acts eventually. I'm not perfect either, to save this marriage, I have to take that step back. We promised to work out the differences together.
Msg to all wives: I hope you'll never encounter something like this. I never thought I would either. I hope this major test will make our love and marriage even stronger, and make sure the husband's needs don't get neglected even after having children. He comes into your life first after all.
Msg to all husbands: When your heart starts to waver, think of what made both of you ended up together, not just act on impulse, attending to your emotional needs. We are not the worms in your stomach nor is ur heart transparent to us. Please communicate, unless you are set to give up your family the moment you start to cheat. Is it worth it? Your call.

Here is my story. I am in my mid 30s. I graduated from NUS and became a property agent a decade ago. I make about $150k to $360k a year.
I remember there was one month where I close $50k and was invited to the award ceremony. I remember feeling very down during the ceremony as most of the salesperson earn above $100k that month. I felt like I am the lowest earner there.
Fast forward these few years, every month are there 100, 200 plus salesperson making 6 figures a month. The company even had to expand the away categeory to differentiate people who make $100k, $250k, $500k and even $1m a MONTH.
Last year I clocked about $280k a year and I am satisfied. But my team mate earned over $4m. His income tax alone is almost $1m. Whats my $280k as compared to him?
Not forgeting my $280k doesnt even give me a name on the producer chart.
Here, most agent drive, if you drive a japanese car, and another agent drive a european or sportscar, you will feel damn malu.
Here, everyone owns 1 condo each, husband 1, wife 1. The company management team mostly stays in landed property.

Well my friend you don't understand. I have never been lucky to celebrate my birthday with many friends. Since primary school, secondary school, JC and university, nobody has bothered to ask when is my birthday. My classmates went out to enjoy birthday together everytime, except mine. Once the entire class just left to go to Swensens in between classes without even inviting me, and just pretended that nothing happened when I asked them. Secretly down inside I hope others can wish me happy birthday, and I cry to sleep every year on my birthday through my university years.
Yes this is many years in the past and that I have grown up and should just let go of the past. Yes I am being selfish and being attention seeking and I should just man up. I am sorry that you guys have that impression of me. I just wanted to share this becoz now I do my best to remember the birthdays of my close friends, and give them a birthday wish or treat them to a meal, as much as my budget allows. I have been in solitude for 20 years of my life (and I deserved it), I do not want my friends to have the same outcome as me.

Happy birthday.

If a women post about her sugarbook experience, she is empowering, brave, not constrained by the limits and expectations of society. If a man post about his sugarbook experience, he is a scumbag.
When a man wants to split expenses 50-50, he is calculative, not generous, dump him. When a women wants to split housework 50-50, it is equality.
Just like how guys should mind their own business and not care about what girls wear, why should girls not mind their own business and not care about how guys spend their money.
In this day and age, equality is only used when it suits the narrative of females, otherwise it is why are you not gentlemanly enough.

I saw many people bashing me for not even having 1k savings lol. Do you know how does it feels like to be broke AF for your entire life? Living paycheck to paycheck is not desirable, but there is no other choice for some people lol
Being the sole breadwinner of my family since 10 years ago (when I was just 18!) I am not able to complete my studies, I do not have a high paying job (I earn just 3k+ a month and yes I’ve been trying to upgrade myself to get a higher paying job, I started out with just 1.2k job so tell me how far have I come? Lol) and I have a family of 4 to take care of!
What type of commitments I have you say? I have to pay my parent’s medical bill, my siblings’ study loan + my own study loan that I took up to upgrade myself.
I do not own anything branded, oh in fact the most “branded”thing I have in possession is my 2nd hand iphone 11. Is that trying to “live a luxurious life” to you?
All of you don’t understand that as you’re not the one living in poverty for 28 years. You don’t have to feed and provide for your family since 18 years old, when you’re basically forced out of school to earn money for the family lol.
As for my bf’s side I won’t comment much, but he is in a pretty tough position as well. We are both living paycheck to paycheck while living a FRUGAL lifestyle.
Why do I have thoughts to break up with him? Sorry I probably wasn’t clear enough in my previous post. I’m being selfish, yes. But I feel it’s for our own good. I’m only dragging him down with my commitments, and he is probably also dragging me down with his commitments. We have talked about our finances multiple times, we both agreed that we need to get a higher paying job and lessen our commitments, and marriage and bto is definitely not in the picture for the next 5 years. But why am I so conflicted now? Because I’m worried for my future! For his future!

58054,102124,"I'm married and I've let another person got too close to me. I know I've cheated but at that time the word 'cheat' did not enter my mind.
We were colleagues and work on different floors. I noticed we take the same route to work. I would see her a few stops after me while on the way to work. She's very friendly and would say hi and make small talk. We bumped into each other so often till we decided to meet and go to work together. I didn't think much of it because she's just a friend to me. She started to send me good morning texts. I didn't think much of it. I start to respond back the same greetings.
I found out that we have a few similar interests so sometimes she would send me related jokes so we would have a good laugh. I start to reply back the same. I thought since she knows I'm married there shouldn't be a problem as I see her as a younger sister. I was having some family issues then, and her jokes cheered up my day when I'm down. When she flirts with me, I flirted back to show her I understood.
I notice she was texting me more often. I thought it was starting to feel weird, it felt like courtship? But I considered her a friend so I just continue to talk to her. She would ask me for help and guidance regarding work as well as her personal relationships. I feel bad for her because I get the sense she has a sad past and she seems to make childish decisions in regards to love. All this while I do not have sexual or romantic feelings for her. I do care for her as a friend. I also wonder why is she on my mind all the time. Sometimes she would take the jokes too far and mention my wife which I dislike. So I would ignore her.
This continued for months until she was blast texting my phone one day while I was home and my wife saw the messages.
I was still in denial mode when my wife confronted me about my relationship with this person. I defended myself and insisted I'm just friends with her. But I couldn't answer about the amount of talking and the amount of photos exchanged. I try to convince myself and also my wife it's just a normal friendship because I didn't touch that person.
What made an impact on me that I've really done wrong was the reaction of my wife. I didn't know I can hurt her so badly. My wife didn't eat and sleep for over two days. She barely drank anything. I've never seen her in such a deranged state. She would suddenly wail, scream, sob, hit me, tell me she hate me. Hug me. Tell me she love me. To know I am the cause of her pain, I feel great shame and guilt, almost unbearable. I love my wife and I have no idea how to make things better for her. To know that she will never trust me again, I don't know how to make it up to her that I will never do anything like this again.
I've since cut off all communications with this person and blocked her. She tried to get in touch with me but I don't care about her anymore. I also felt like I was being played by this woman. So there's no way I will rekindle this friendship.
To people who always say once a cheater always a cheater. I have to disagree. Not everyone is like this. I never want to be that person again. I would never want to hurt my wife again. Else I will lose her forever. I would rather not exist anymore should I ever lose her this way. She's everything to me. She's my forever person. I want to grow old with her. Only her. And I hope she forgives me one day.

58486,102964,"TLDR - Reading about the family with 8 kids, I can’t help thinking about my growing up process.
I grew up in a pretty big family as well, there are 5 of us, and my family was living at bare minimum too. I got along well with my siblings, there was lots of laughter and funny moments. But we couldn’t afford some of the opportunities that we wanted. I rmb the insensible primary sch me asking my parents to let me go for piano or ballet lessons after seeing my friends performing, but was told that we cannot afford. Even for my sports CCA, I had to pull out cos of the fees incurred, and switched to a club that won’t incur fees.
Moving to sec school, I couldn’t join my friends to eat outside school cos fast food was considered expensive. My friends would go for occasional movie trips, but I did not join any cos it was expensive, plus as the eldest, I have to go home to take care of my younger siblings. I had difficulty integrating into my circle of friends since I can’t hang out.
I started doing part-time after JC and all the way through uni, in order to fund my own expenses in school. I was asked to forgo a major of my choice and opt for a more lucrative one as I am expected to help out with family finances when I start working. In order to juggle work and studies, I couldn’t actively participate in CCAs. While others form friendships and networks in uni, I was pretty much isolated.
Having started work for a couple of years, my savings have been limited since I took over the allowance and expenses for my youngest sibling in poly, plus some other bills. My boyfriend and I has been dragging our BTO plans in order for me to build my savings.
I love my family and I know my parents tried their best to care of us. I feel very very bad for thinking this way, but I always thought about the missed opportunities and social life due to financial constraints. While I grew up with useful house-chores and babysitting skills, I would hope to have picked up some other skills ie sports, music during my childhood. I mean, who will want to spend their childhood doing chores and babysitting.
I’ll probably get bashed for this. People would say I should be contented and there are people out there who are worse off. Yes definitely, I don’t deny. I’m not saying that the children in the report will feel the same way as me; they might grow up feeling that their childhood was perfect for them. But I feel that there should be a balance between wanting alot of children for a merrier family vs being able to afford a childhood that your children want. After all, childhood is very short-lived and we won’t get to live through it again.
Just a rant.

59048,104026,"Inspired by #104015's post, I felt I should share my experience and reasons for leaving MOE as well (sorry for the long post ahead). Many have asked me why but being one who is not good at impromptu interviews my answers can be quite short sometimes. For background, I left MOE some years ago and am now in the IT field.
Being the simpleton at a tender age of ~20, I signed my life away on the MOE scholarship, thinking that my career would more or less be on a good path as a ""scholar"". Furthermore, my university fees would be fully paid off and I'd even get an allowance and all sorts of subsidies during my studies (eg. exchange, hall). Life as an undergrad was pretty good as I did not have to worry about finding internships and jobs like my other friends had to. For the first year or so in teaching, I was fully committed to MOE's cause. My school had a pretty decent culture, workload was manageable and most importantly I had a fun group of colleagues who joined around the same time as I did.
But somewhere along, I started to see cracks that hinted to me that this is not where I want to be:
1. Progression was slow, unless you are a higher-tiered scholar. In today's era employees would be considering changing jobs every 2 - 3 years, earning a decent raise each time. In my current team, someone who stayed 2 years would be considered pretty senior and experienced. In MOE, you are a beginning teacher (BT) for 3 years. Only after 3 years do you attend a ""BT Graduation"" programme and become a normal teacher. What's worse is that while your progression is limited as a BT, your workload is not. I ""fondly"" remember an instance where about 1 year+ into my career, there was an intern who requested to observe my lesson, only to be rejected by the coordinator because I'm ""only a BT"". When I went into my current organisation, my boss told me that my CEP (an indicator of how high the organisation thinks you can climb) was shockingly low, even lower than that of a fresh grad in the current organisation.
2. Talking about money and promotion is a taboo. When teachers talk, the implicit assumption is that one is going to be there for a long time, like decades. And mentioning otherwise will yield shocked, SHOCKED faces, as if you don't place students above everything else you are the scum of the earth. While we all like to think that teachers are very noble (and I do think it is a noble profession), I certainly believe that they should be able to talk about such matters without feeling guilty or fear repercussions, and supervisors must be willing and prepared to have such conversations. This is what makes a workplace progressive. There is absolutely nothing wrong in having ambitions to develop oneself professionally and seek growth, even in monetary terms, and the saying that ""just do your best for the students; we must always put them first; the recognition will follow"" is just complete bovine waste and a weak excuse to avoid hard conversations.
3. Performance is hard to measure. When students did well, the credit goes to the probably very nurturing teacher who went the extra mile and implemented 101 pedagogies to help students learn. When students don't do well? ""Oh, they were lazy."" ""Oh, they did not hand in homework on time."" ""Oh, they don't listen in class."" I personally didn't like this culture, but I am completely guilty of partaking in it. I want a job where I am in control of my KPI.
4. The lack of academic rigour. Everyone is so obssessed over ""Cambridge's marking"" that nobody wants to question why. In major exams, for fairness, one teacher would be assigned to mark one level/stream of papers. Once when I was going through the exam paper, a student asked me why his/her answer was not accepted. I looked at it and thought it was reasonable, so I went to ask the marker. The reply I got was ""because this is how Cambridge marked"" and no matter how hard I pressed for any possible reason why would Cambridge mark like that, the marker refused to participate in any intellectual discussion apart from the initial reply. I was frustrated because I did not know how to account to my student, but even more so that there was no interest to even discuss from an academic standpoint on possible reasons for such a marking. How can we, as teachers, inspire students about the very subject we are teaching if we do not even want to discuss it?
5. The blind leading the blind. Many teachers have been in the profession since graduation and have no experience in the corporate world. Yet, we are required to teach students about what they'd need in future. And no, one Education and Career Guidance counsellor in the school cannot be used as a defence here.
As someone who had absolutely zero coding experience up and until a friend who introduced to me ""How to automate the boring stuff with Python"", you can imagine the road to switching career was not smooth; I had set a goal for myself to find a job by the time my bond ends but with each passing day the anxiety ballooned. My after-office hours were filled with either watching Udemy videos or applying for jobs/following up on applied jobs. I applied to over 70 jobs and only had less than 10 interviews. But lady luck shone on me and finally offered me a position the day after my bond ended, with only a small pay cut.
I have since learnt and seen so much in my current job and the prospects are really good. And I'm not just saying this because I'm in the tech field - even generalist employees have industry experience which would make them marketable and more importantly, the network of connections they've built with people of diverse backgrounds will open up so many doors to them. Jobs these days are really easier via connections. Recently, a colleague of mine shared an analogy that some jobs are travellators, while others are stepping stones. Travellators are those which are chill, but have slower progression. Stepping stones are those which are rough, but gives you great progression. Teaching, on the otherhand, is a well. It is neither chill nor offer good progression, and is incredibly difficult to get out.
If you are a teacher who is thinking of getting out, unless you have a great network of connections already, I'm not going to sugarcoat it but I will say that it is challenging and you may need to backtrack somewhat. Can try applying to other govt bodies - they are typically friendlier grounds to venture into. But if you manage to find a place which suits you, the rewards are going to be bountiful and you will never look back. All the best to you!
P.S. is there some kind of career support group for teachers looking for career switch?

My husband and I are both high level executives at tech companies. We both draw decent six-figure salaries and have a comfortable life. However, the way my husband runs our household makes me worry quite a lot. He runs the house as if it's a company, with goal setting, performance evaluation and what not. Some of the crazy things he has enforced on us:
- Bi-weekly sprint meetings and retros where we meet to discuss how far along we are in achieving in terms of our career growth, personal growth and fitness
- Quarterly OKRs for our son who is in Primary school
- He made our son set goals for his exam grades, e.g. 95 for English, 100 for Math, etc
- He created dashboards to track our combined income and expenditure, goal progress, etc
- Biannual performance review where we give each other feedback and he decides a rating for us. He will also give an overall family rating depending on our overall performance
- Our family holiday locations and the budget are determined by our family rating. The higher the rating, the better the location (ranging from Maldives to Sentosa)
- Every half, we do roadmapping and each of us have to also talk about how we envision ourselves and the family to be in the next few years and propose changes
I'm a bit afraid for my son that he's growing up in such a stressful environment and have an abnormal childhood. Will this be the case or am I worrying over nothing?

And there his profile is, in that time capsule captured many years ago. I scrolled through his profile. The loving memories of his family, his lovely wife and two young kids. His friends and colleagues, all so contented and so happy in the photos. Those happy times.
The cancer must have torn him and his family apart. I recalled his fight with the cancer, his hospitalization leaves and no pay leave to recuperate. All looks well, then a relapse struck and his health went spiral down to his eventual demise.
I can't help but to wonder how is his family coping now. His kids were so young then, they should be teens by now. How are they now? They must have been devastated to lost a father at such young age. I teared while having those thoughts but did dare to make contact with the family to ask.
All the problems I read in this page, all the whatnot on BGR, dating apps or BTOs, suddenly seemed so trival compared to a loss of life.

Culture wise, it is no surprise that employees have intense hours, often giving you demeaning useless work just because your manager can or upper management flip prata
Employees are expected to grind to prepare for big days (1/1, 2/2, 3/3, etc.) but the company just keeps coming up with more big days (3/15??) to keep the grind on.
Interview and pay wise, they also operate like a Chinese company. They asked for documents all the way back to secondary school, all my past pay slips, and even demanded for the detailed breakdown of current offer (which I have to give in order to continue interviewing, and no, quoting Jo Teo does not work)
I had to suck up, praise and say nice things to the HR, and, if not I was given bad interview time slots. I felt disgusted but I know it’s part of the culture.
To add insult to injury, after giving me take home assignments and multiple interview rounds, and knowing all details about my other offers, they low balled me and offered me just a low few % higher than my last drawn, even after adding share. My other offer was completely ignored. It was 50% higher than what Shopee was offering. Why even ask me about my offer breakdown and documents if you are just going to offer last drawn + 3%??
They offered more equity but it does not matter because the stock has dropped so much.
I was so surprised that CCS welcomed them so publicly last year. Is he out of touch or is he just chasing after the number of jobs SEA bring to Singapore?

We have been saving up since secondary school. We have plans to BTO, raise beautiful kids and go on dream vacations. All these have come to a naught within a span of just a few days.
The idea of investing in cryptocurrency was first introduced to him by his circle of close friends. He was made to believe that he can make a quick buck and retire early. He took his friends words for it and dabbled into crypto trading.
There were occasions where he would boast to me that he had made a killing which would enable us to realize our dream quicker. Given the volatility of such investment, he assured me that he is well aware of the risk and persuaded me to join as well. Considering that his decision meant well for both of us, I decided to follow suit and entrust my life savings to him in hope that he will not disappoint me.
I should have known better not to do it when he began distancing himself from me and stayed silent on Whatsapp over the past few weeks. Being a concerned partner, I reached out to him to find out how he is doing and to check on our investment. When the topic of investment is raised, he would flare up for no reason and would shout at me over the phone.
A few days ago, a crypto-coin known as TerraLuna (or whatever they call it) made headlines for losing all of its value with allegations made against the founder for fraud.
Worried that it would impact our investment, I phoned my fiance but failed to reach him. I tried to dial his friend only to find out that he had put all his money in this so-called coin only to lose everything. Upon hearing the news, my heart sunk knowing that our hard-earned money were gone and our dreams destroyed. The last I heard about him was from his friend who told me that he had to resort to borrowing from loan sharks in hope to recover his losses only to end up losing more.
We have plans to hold our wedding in Dec which was made known to everyone early this year. Now we have to call it off because of his silly mistake. I can no longer see a future with him and I certainly do not see myself helping with his debt. Heck, I am even contemplating doing OnlyFans to re-build my wealth.
I am v lost as to what to do and how to break the news to everyone about our wedding dismissal should they question about it due to this incident.

Has low self-esteem
Is childish
Is materialistic
Is a workaholic
Is abusive
Is ugly
Is too vain
Is weird

So quit framing being single as a consequence of a character flaw.
And its not necessarily a numbers game. Some people find their partner after 1 date. Some find it after mamy dates. Some never at all. If your defition of finding love is a numbers quest then finding love is like a homework to you. You think love is so trivial you can solve it by doing it like a piece of homework? Life is not a piece of homework. Hard work is critical in life but it doesn't pay off most of the time. What helps hard work pay off is luck. Most people work hard like shit to get what they want and they still never do. And what is worse people framing being single as a sign of character flaw can really beat the shit out of your confidence. I have seen how such toxic culture twisted my friends.
Singles. Love yourself. Even if you get married you are still all you have. Marriage is a companionship not a reliance-ship.
