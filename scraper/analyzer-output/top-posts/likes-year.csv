60283,106462,"I grew up in a less than privileged background. I worked super hard, because my mother told me to. She told me that if I didnt work hard, she wouldn't pay for school. That it.
I slogged my ass off, raffles, then nus medicine. I just worked hard, listened to advice from my peers, and worked. I remember failing multiple times during this process, failing, and getting up, no tuition nothing. and before you think I am bragging, I am not, I am bitter. I am bitter because I had no help during those struggles, those struggles where I saw my friends going for tuition after their fun ccas so they could get someone to catch up with them, and then off for nice holidays after each tiring semester. meanwhile I went home to a crowded home with not much.
in university, my parents didnt even understand the course I was in. They said oh wow good ah doctor. But they didnt understand the stresses I was under, how my peers looked down on me for not being able to get that starbucks every week, or eat the same meal every day (""why you always eat the same thing lol"") no one said anything explicitly, but just people started hanging out with me less... and less.
Now I have a family, small but its mine. dont really have friends from school, just a few work ones who we get teh (coffee shop) together and its surprisingly the highlight of my week. I dont want to have kids because I dont want them to go through what I had gone through.
my mum, she was probably the driving force behind why i cant quit. I now acknowledge its my trying to live up to her expectations and make her proud that I did all of this. I never once dared to show her my failures, or my struggles, or my isolation. Because I was the son she was proud of, I was important in her eyes. and so I kept the path, never once considered seriously dropping out even though I had minimal interest in this medical path.
its 2am and I have just finished a shift. I hope that someone out there reads this and learns something from it. you wil inevitably be influenced by your parents/peers/society. this is something ive learnt that cannot be avoided. but what you can do is to be conscious of it, and to try bit by bit, to integrate a part of yourself in a sustainable way, a part of happiness in your life so that one day you can find peace in the struggle that is your job/career/course.
Have empathy for the peers who seem isolated and struggling, or even acted out in school. Dont write them off as introverts or whatever. They likely just have more to deal on their plates than you do, or you have more social/economic support than them to get through your shared circumstance. Maybe say hi, share notes, or reach out to them if you havent heard from them for a while and say hey, I see you, I know youre struggling, Im going through this with you (not in those exact words but like sometimes just company helps)
one last thing, I would also like to say thank you to that one senior in school who stood by me when things were tough and that it was very meaningful and prob was the reason for finishing the course.
I try to do that now with my juniors in the hospital. Anyway goodnight

60461,106818,"Everyone has a story, this is mine.
My dad passed away when I was a teenager. Before he fell sick he and my mom got a divorce. Their split was horrid and traumatic for me because I witnessed a lot of violent physical fights. I can still remember he held a knife and wanted to attack my mom. He swung and slammed the door into her and she let out a terrifying scream. Both of them are bad tempered and toxic towards each other. I witnessed all these when I was below the age of 10. I suffered from PTSD for years.
I remember feeling helpless and terrified whenever they start fighting. I forgot the number of times the police showed up because of all the yelling and screaming. Sometimes there's blood on the floor at the scene where they fought. This was how I remember the bulk of my childhood.
My mother is literally a crazy woman as a single parent. In today's day and age, I guess she can be called a bipolar, narcissist, borderline or maybe all of the above. She had no one to fight and argue with so she would regularly unleash all her emotions onto us, especially me, because I'm a female. When I hit puberty, she became more violent towards me. I was not rebellious. I studied hard, but she was never proud of me.
None of our needs mattered. All our birthdays were meant to celebrate her instead. Because that was the day she suffered to give birth to us. Every holiday was supposed to treat her like a queen because she deserves a break. She only cared about controlling us no matter how unreasonable and nonsensical the request is because we owe her our lives. She was not happy even when we followed her instructions. This was how I remember my teenage years.
I was always mentally preparing myself for her to explode on me. To be battered mentally and physically is the norm. There was no way out as I can't bear to leave my younger sibling alone with her. In a sense, I became a mother to my younger sibling. I fed and supported my younger sibling the moment I could because my mother abandoned all her responsibilities to 'find herself'.
She went on to have affairs with married men. Travelled out of sg for months, in the name of love. Lucky I already learnt how to cook by age 11. I remember bawling my eyes out when she left home with her luggage. I was 13. How tf do kids run a home for months without any adult? But we survived.
When her mood comes, she would go on a rampage and say we are cursed and we will grow up to lead the same kind of life like her. She hated our existence because she lost her freedom, her youth, her everything. For a while, I actually believed her that I should not exist.
Took me decades to understand why she hated me. I didn't end up having a lousy life as she expected. I found a job that I love and actually enjoy. I met someone, married and lived a totally different life from hers. I have long term friendships unlike her. All of us are leading peaceful lives now.
She is wrong about all of us.
Don't believe everything your parents tell you. They aren't always right. Never believe you are doomed to walk in their footsteps. There's always a chance to change your destiny.

The guy who earns less than 4k a month.
I don't know you. But I've met men like you. I totally get why you made such sweeping statements about women. No one likes to be rejected. I can tell you one thing. Even men who make less than 4k a month can get women. But would you reject the women who want you? You probably won't even give these kind of women a second look as you deem them as not good enough for you. It's like you're a 5/10, wanting an 8/10 and looking down at any woman who is 4 to 6.
Everyone wants the best for themselves but what do you have that the 'best' must accept you?
I'm guessing from your post, not only you do not have money, you also don't have the looks, personality or intelligence to nab the type of women you're after. So what does that leave you? Focus on what you can work on. Calling women gold diggers because you are rejected just shows you haven't learnt much about women.
If a man have enough good points but don't make enough money, some women will be willing to stay around and work together with you. Trust me, you wouldn't want a woman who will be with you just because you can earn 20k a month. Just like all people who want to have a relationship, we want someone who is willing to be with us through thick and thin.
The only advantage you have is that men have almost no expiry date compared to women. You can be 40 and still date women from 20s to 40s while a woman of the same age have to settle for a smaller pool.
But above all, I still have faith that men like you would be able to find someone one day. She may not be your first choice, she may not be a perfect 10, but I can assure you, as long as you play your part as a decent person, lover, boyfriend or husband in this partnership and help each other blossom, she can become a perfect 10 in your eyes.

61100,108189,"Regarding #108150:
There is nothing wrong with wanting to be rich. My father passed away when I was in secondary school because of a rare but curable cancer, and if we had $250,000 when he was diagnosed, he probably would not have died. He worked in construction and my mom worked at a nail salon. I have 3 siblings and we all lived in a one-bedder. I know a lot of people will disagree with me vehemently, but poverty is no fun.
I am now one year out of medical school and my goal is to give my family a better life. 
Believe me when I say I understand fully that money will be less than useless in death. To me, making money has never been about what I can spend it on. Money will enable me to be a safety net for my loved ones.
Buying unnecessary things, traveling, paying over the top for a meal, I have never quite understood the appeal of such things. Not that I ever could afford them in the first place. 
My best friend with whom I went to Hwa Chong grew up not too far from where Goh Chok Tong lives in Bukit Timah. He never spends more than $5 on a meal. It puzzled me in the beginning but then he revealed to me that he’s not being intentionally frugal he just found it difficult to justify how a $20 plate of chicken rice is 4x better than one he can get for $5. Today he is a Ivy League graduate who is in line to take over his father’s business, but he is still the same guy who wears washed out t shirts, takes the bus, and eats $3 cai fan whenever we do meet. 
When I was in medical school, I met friends from upper-middle class families who were as frugal as I am. It was only surprising how common they are, people whose parents are specialists, lawyers, businessmen who are more humble than a blade of grass. 
I’m not saying it’s wrong to live your life to the fullest. How anyone wants to live their life should be their prerogative. But I think if you want to mitigate the regret you will feel if you died prematurely by ignoring the fact that the vast majority of us will probably live as long as the life expectancy seems to suggest (84 years), then I think it would be a mistake not to make preparations for those ages that you will no longer be productive. 
Lastly I just want to say this, seeing the world can be a great experience, but the same critique that you can’t bring money to the grave can also be said about your memories. You bring nothing away because you simply cease to exist. People who obsess over money aren’t all shallow and materialistic. Some of us need it to pay for a better life for the people we care about.

60410,106731,"Today will be my last day in Singapore for a long time.
This is my (33M) first time posting on NUSWhispers so do forgive me if my formatting looks weird ah. Growing up I always wanted the Singaporean Dream, to find a nice girl, get married, have kids, BTO in a decent neighborhood, etc. But life is unexpected and I found myself more and more detached as time went by - let me just share why.
One of the first wake-up calls was when I was discussing getting a BTO with my ex. When we actually looked at the figures, we realised that if we wanted to balance saving for old age and paying off loans, it would take a good couple decades to pay off everything. Renovations, furniture, etc... the figures added up and it looked really daunting. For us folks with a more humble background (3-4k take home), this was a subtle reality check- at one point we looked at our finances and decided with heavy hearts that we might not be able to fulfil our dream of having kids before 35. It was during COVID that our relationship was fraught with more financial difficulties, and we parted amicably.
The pandemic was a double-edged sword. I managed to keep my job, but the workload only got worse even though I was working from home. I was at home, there but not there. I believe I can speak for almost everyone in my age group when I say that we all became jaded and upset with our lives and our jobs during that period. The rat race only intensified for my colleagues and I, and I kept asking myself- is this the Singapore Dream?
During that time, I was dating actively on Tinder. I found that many Singaporean girls are just too similar to each other, and in a fashion that wasn't to my taste. Yes, Singaporean guys only hike and gym. But Singaporean girls always have the same movie quotes or some random MBTI/Horoscope sign on their Tinder profile. They have the same interests and conversations. Political views were never diverse- in fact, many girls don't think about politics, as it isn't their interest. I don't think we can blame anyone for that- Singapore is just too small, and lacks space for us to explore hobbies and interests. We all end up liking the same stuff, watching the same shows, and we all end up feeling that a trip to Don Don Donki is an adventure. But after breaking up with whom I thought I would spend my life with, I felt like I didn't want to lower my bar anymore.
I had a friend who went to Israel during his NOC days and stayed there afterwards for his work. I visited him there once the pandemic died down, and he introduced me to a friend of his whom we hit off right away. I have to say, when the folks in Israel talk about equality, they mean equality. She laughs at the Singaporean girls who say that females shouldn't need to serve National Service. She refuses to be stuck in a rat race and chooses to spend her limited time in her 30s taking care of her ailing parents. She is refreshing, unlike any girl whom I've met before in Singapore. I was smitten. The months flew by, and before I knew it, I had already made plans to join her there. I have gotten a job offer and I will be flying towards Israel tonight.
I will be moving there to pursue a new way of life, a new job and hopefully a new place to stay until my old age. I will miss the small things in Singapore- the efficient MRT, my favourite Saizeriya (yes, maybe this is the reason I was dumped hahaha), the top quality Roti Coin at Kembangan MRT. But I think that this Chapter of my life in Singapore is at an end. I look forward to my new life in a new place!!

60318,106546,"My dad is a wildly successful business owner with a tech recruitment agency with operations in New York City and San Francisco, and a net worth in the tens of millions. We live in a bungalow in Bukit Timah. He always told me and my older brother that we should never aim to be a corporate slaves because if one were to commit to working hard for anyone, it should only be for ourselves. I have been told this multiple times for nearly 30 years of my life. He is also of the opinion that people who strive to do very well in school and for their company, will rarely create life-changing wealth, because they are too socialized to doing well for others.
I have done well in school. I went to the best IP school and I graduated FCH from law school. Near the top of my cohort. I then got a masters from Cambridge, where I was also near the top of my cohort. Now that I’ve gotten a big four law job, I feel that my life is comfortable, I make good money, my bosses love me, and I feel no incentive to make it on my own. I was even told in passing that if I keep up my work I could make partner one day.
On the other hand, my older brother is a bioengineer, didn’t do that well for A-levels, graduated from the University of Michigan and then UC Davis, quit his pharma job to start an agricultural technology company in California with four of his friends from college that recently fund raised at an 8-figure valuation. Recently there was even an acquisition attempt that was rejected. Needless to say my dad has started to overwhelmingly favor him over me. He went to the same IP school as I did he was just very lazy about schoolwork.
I have a weird upbringing in that I used to bring home great grades from school and my dad was never impressed. My brother is a tinkerer and he built a PC at the age of 14 and back then my dad couldn’t stop bragging to relatives about it. At 16 he wrote a password manager on iOS that made a few thousand dollars in its first year and I literally have not seen my dad so proud about anything that I’ve ever done before. Not even when I was in the Humanities Programme and ranked 3rd on a literature block test in my JC cohort of 1000 people.
One thing he has never done is gave me explicit instructions to do anything. He has always believed in giving us a lot of freedom to try things and to fail. What affects me deeply is his unwillingness to show any regard towards those who are not inclined to challenge conventional life goals. I once overheard a conversation between him and my mom in the bedroom after he showed absolutely no reaction when I ranked first in my sec 2 class. He told my mom, “all he did was work very hard studying to do well on an exam, what’s so special about that?” That hurt me deeply. He has this deep distaste for what he believes to be a “typical Singaporean philosophy”—do well in school, get a good job, promote, make some money, retire. Which I frankly don’t know where he got it from since he also went to Raffles College, and he also has a degree from Cambridge.
I respect him greatly and I just wish to get some approval from him. I’m just not an enterprising person by nature. I find it odd that someone would look down on people who do well academically and aim to do well at their jobs. If my brother’s startup hadn’t been an immediate success he would have been working for no pay and no reward for 5 years. The amount of money I saved in the past 3 years alone gets me 80% of the way to making a downpayment on my first apartment. There was no risk involved. If I keep being on this trajectory I’d have more money than I know what to do with anyway. I honestly don’t need anymore than $5 million to retire comfortably.
I don’t hate my brother. I’m incredibly proud of him even though I used to not be able to stand it when his exam was literally 24 hours away and he’d be twiddling his pen in the living room watching anime. It always seemed to me that he was squandering his talent since I know him to be very intelligent. He learns things ridiculously quickly. Nevertheless I think the world values all sorts of people and I am incredibly happy that he has the creative energy that startup founders often share. I just don’t understand why my dad values people like him and not people who can really take an instruction and deliver the best work.

60372,106655,"Don't mind my long story, but this is for all the current NUS students who feel overwhelmed and feel like dropping out.
My name is Mei Ling and I am a 22-year-old Chinese female studying medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My journey to becoming a doctor started when I was just a little girl, watching my grandmother struggle with a chronic illness. I was struck by the power of medicine and the difference that doctors could make in people's lives. I knew then and there that I wanted to become a doctor, to help others the way that my grandmother's doctors had helped her.
Growing up, I was a top student, constantly striving for excellence in everything I did. I was driven, ambitious, and passionate. So, when it was time to choose a career, medicine was the natural choice for me. I was determined to become a doctor and make a difference in the world.
But the journey to becoming a doctor has been far from easy. The Singapore education system is known for its high standards and intense pressure, but in the field of medicine, it's even more grueling. Every day feels like a race against time, with endless hours of studying, assignments, and exams. The competition is fierce, and the expectations are sky-high.
I used to love going to university, soaking up knowledge and expanding my horizons. But now, the thought of stepping foot on campus fills me with dread. I often find myself lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and wondering why I am even there. The constant pressure to succeed has taken a toll on my mental health, and I feel like I am drowning in stress and exhaustion.
The constant comparisons to my peers only add to my stress. It seems like everyone around me is thriving, while I am just struggling to keep up. I have lost my sense of identity and my confidence has taken a hit. I used to be so sure of my path, but now I question everything. I often wonder if I am even cut out for this field, and if I will ever be able to meet the expectations placed upon me.
I have considered dropping out of NUS countless times. The thought of not having to worry about grades and expectations is incredibly tempting. However, I know that quitting is not the solution. I fear that it will only add to my feelings of failure and regret. I fear that I will look back on this time and regret not pushing through, not fighting for my dreams.
Despite my struggles, I am determined to find a way to overcome this burnout. I know that my passion for medicine and my drive to make a difference are still there, buried under the stress and exhaustion. I am searching for ways to rediscover my love for learning and regain my sense of purpose.
I have started seeking support from my professors and peers. I have also taken up mindfulness practices, such as meditation and yoga, to help manage my stress. I have realized the importance of self-care and have started setting aside time for myself to recharge and do things that bring me joy. Whether it's reading a good book, taking a walk in the park, or spending time with friends and family, I have learned to prioritize my well-being and prioritize myself.
I am slowly but surely making progress. I am beginning to rediscover my love for medicine and the reasons why I chose this path. I am regaining my confidence and finding my voice. The journey will not be easy, but I am determined to overcome this burnout and come out stronger on the other side.
I refuse to let the expectations of others define me and dictate my future. I am ready to take control of my life and forge my own path in the field of medicine. I am determined to become a doctor and make a difference in the world, on my own terms.
So if I am trying, you all can too!

I came to Singapore 15 years ago, thinking of making Singapore my home, as it came on top choices compared to other countries, such as US, Australia and Canada. I have studied here and meet my wife here and had my baby here, however Singapore had a different plan. I am a PR for more than 10 years and they are not ready to give my wife a PR even though she has studied here and been here almost same time as me and they rejected application my wife's and my child's PR. So HDB is out of choice. We both make a combined income of 10k+ but more and more money is squeezed out of us. Looks like Singapore Values free money from China and Hong Kong than integrating locally trained people.
At present our house house hold expenditure is more than 80% of our income and our life style is just average, so you can earn and have a decent life in Singapore. But we feel we are just Surviving here and not really living. We are not evening talking about luxury here like car, condo etc. Just a basic life. And it's same for my Singapore friends but slightly better because of HDB. In general, Singapore is becoming a advanced society with surviving people.
What I see from Govt plan is either you are super rich or under 3k family income rest all will just be rich on paper but poor in real life. All my class mates (locals) have already left Singapore and I didn't listen to their advice to pack up 10 years ago. Now, I am Surviving. When I tell about these things , most locals will complain you can go back where you came from, but if we keep having such mentalities Singapore will become next Japan.
Right now, govt is happy to collect millions from foreigners ABSB and giving $300 CDC vouchers to keeps locals mouth shut. So, till govt doesn't prioritise welfare of people, Sg will be millionaires zombie land.

60534,106967,"Exactly 1 year ago, I wrote a confession here. I shared about dating a guy who earned so much less than me, and I had concerns with that. At that time in the comment section, I got bashed a lot.
Anyway I took the feedback, I went ahead and agreed to be his gf. Today, we have broken up for 4 months. The reason for breaking is (again) because he earned too little, and therefore his mindset was too different from mine when it comes to financial goals and spending. I also find it was too hard to feel happy when I had to keep hearing him complaining about paying for dates (to clarify, most of the time we split 50/50, sometimes I treated him but when it was his turn, the complaints came out). On top of this, with a humble financial background also comes very uneducated behaviors (for example, being mean to family members or cruel to animals). Not saying it is the case for all who earns less, just saying it’s a common risk.
Hence, for those girls who feel alright dating down, good for you. I can’t. I’m not demanding to be treated like princess here. Thinking back on how I was bashed and advised to not be materialistic 1 year ago, I just feel bitter. How women are often looked down on even for asking for just a little bit of fairness in relationships.
Recently, I’ve started dating someone who earns more. It feels good that he is classy and willingly picks up the bill most of the time (although I still insist to pay for some to maintain 50/50). So I’m not in for materialism but pointing out the financial capabilities speak something.

60456,106812,"To #106787 and those who got their A-level results recently: I agree with Prof Leong. I chose what I loved and studied math. It wasn't even my strongest subject. But it made me more money than the 99.999th percentile of software engineers and I now have enough to lounge around, write these long rants for the rest of my life, and gloat.
I didn't collect my A-levels cert on results day, so I found out my grades a week later. Just didn't like queuing and comparing grades. I was already admitted to the school I wanted, and the admission criteria for physics and math at NUS/NTU were low enough I knew I had my backstops. Turns out I was far from a perfect A-level score.
Admissions advice (somewhat CS-specific):
1. There’s wisdom in ignoring the current market outlook for choosing your career path. The market is extremely efficient, so if a particular major pays well now, you can be assured that it will be competitive and commoditized 4-6 years from now, arbitraging away whatever easy upside you get from picking that major.
2. This negative autocorrelation is already evident now with the tech layoffs - I know many in PE, PWM, consulting, marketing, sales, real estate, design etc. roles who’ve made more than their CS counterparts, with less effort.
3. There’s no free lunch. If it were really that easy to predict which sector would outperform others, you’d make even more money just leveraging your education funds in the stock market than studying in that field. Hypothetically, if you really would’ve had such a positive outlook on tech jobs 10 years ago, you’d have been richer just going all-in on FAANG stocks back then than getting a CS degree. And if you still feel your friends in CS really have better job prospects than you, it's never late to just buy into a tech sector ETF.
4. You don’t need a CS degree to be a practitioner. Incidentally, most of the best software engineers I’ve worked with have other STEM degrees or even no degree. 7th employee at Citadel - physics PhD, code still runs today, and he has more money than Jeff Dean.
5. Point 4 and ""do what you love"" translates into something I train all of my hiring managers to look out for. Which is that a software engineer who did in applied math at a top 30 school is most often stronger than a software engineer who did Course 6 at MIT.
6. Most global optimization problems are intractable, and only some highly-constrained optimization problems are easy. Applying this principle: it's bad to be ""interested in tech"". (I wrote #104647 on this.) Find a narrower interest than that. Even “interested in frontend” is not enough. There’s flavors of frontend: do you like frontend tooling and build, or frontend visual design, or building product flows, or maintaining component libraries? The sooner you can apply constraints in your career, the easier your (wealth) optimization problem. It’s hard to get rich by becoming among the top 100 frontend engineers in the world; it’s easier to get rich by becoming among the top 100 component library guys in the world.
7. I’ve seen many people falsely equivocate “Do what you love"" with being lazy. Truly doing what you love takes more hard work, grit, and determination than working for straight A’s to get into CS, law, or whatever course du jour. Traveling the world is not doing what you love. Writing a book; decorating homes; taking selfies; singing aren't. Doing what you love means getting so good at what you're passionate in that you've become one of the best in the world at it. It happens that I know people doing each of the above who've made 1-2 orders of magnitude more than the average L6 software engineer at Google. My best friend made more money modeling in her 20s than any L7 SWE I know, because she's good at it.
8. Taking a scholarship makes it hard for you to choose what you love. So be cautious. (And please don't be the guy with rich parents who breaks his bond after getting to Oxford, because you're depriving someone else.)
9. Pursuing what you love has ancillary benefits. Chiefly, it makes it easier to make quality friends in your adult life. It's nearly as hard making friends when I had $100 as when I had $100M.
I had lunch with the late Martin Trust shortly before he passed. If you have any clothes from H&M or Uniqlo made in Sri Lanka or Vietnam, you owe it to him. He said one thing that day that stuck with me today, ""I made my wealth selling underwear, so nothing's beneath me."" The man's short, but he stood tall. I heard he was surrounded with family and friends at the end.
Do what you love, and whatever you choose, don't fret if it's beneath your station. Because you'll have so many more ways to find happiness if you do.

At the age of 22 in 2020 (Year 2 NUS Female), my mum had depression, which prompted my dad to quit his job to take care of my mum. Since that year, I was silently forced into the only breadwinner of the family. While studying, I took on part-time jobs and internships while studying to save up for allowance, give my parents some money and save to pay for my tuition fees. It has been very tiring but I endured throughout.  I did not tell friends about my situation and they thought I was just hardworking. By the end of Year 4, I have 4 internships including a long term part-time job that made my resume stood out. My sincerity and hard work landed me good testimonials written by my  Managers from my first 2 internships. 
Fast forward to Dec 2021, my last internship was a nightmare to me as my supervisor was very overbearing, I cried a lot silently and bearer her throughout. I cannot quit as it was a graded FYI. Towards the end of the 4th internship, there was finally light at the end of the tunnel. That was at least something I thought! I was thankful to have found a FT job shortly after I graduated from NUS. For the sake of money to provide a better living for my family, I accepted the  FT job immediately. The pay was 3.5k (average pay for my degree). Little did I know it is just a beginning my nightmare.
My immediate supervisor  micromanaged me a lot, scolded me a lot and didn’t give me face when scolding me in front of other colleagues. My reputation went down. The only good side is my reporting officer is very understanding in his words. Nevertheless he still side my immediate supervisor as she is a top-performer in the company. Throughout 1 year plus, I lost weight and dreaded work but I cannot quit for fear that my family income will hit 0 as the only breadwinner in the family. 
Concurrently in Jun 2022, I met my first love through my childhood friend and we got together in Dec 2022. He was someone who I can turn to about family issues and has similar goals and values as me. Whenever I felt so tired from working and carrying family burden, I endure throughout the weekdays and weekends have always been my greatest pleasure to hang out with him.  He was just like my best friend and a reliable partner. I treat his parents as if they are my parents. Whenever I have nice food, I would bring it over to their house to share. 
Little did I know in Feb 2023, I realise he has been cheating on me all these while and worst of all, his family and that childhood friend  who introduced me to him have known about it and had been hiding the issue from me. I have never felt so hurt in my heart. My world came crushing down. He apologised and and I forgave him. Then a few months down the road, I discovered him seeing another girl again. I blocked him and he came to my house to apologise to me. As I was kind-hearted, I choose to forgive him and let it slide. The last straws were:
(1) Caught a random bonquet of flower at his house. He cannot explain what the flowers are for and his mum has to jump in to “cover up” for him. EPIC fail!!
(2) He brought me to a friends’ gathering session and openly checked out other girls. Neither did he introduced me to the rest, I was left transparent there!!!
(3) Lying about his whereabouts, only to find out he was going on dates.
In Jun 2023, I mustered courage to totally cut off from him and walk away. It was never easy, he came back sometimes to check in and I just ignored him. 
I was low key disappointed because when our mutual friends (from other clique) knew about the breakup, they sided him. They obviously did not know about his cheating affair and chose to side him. I felt that there was no point for myself to fight for my say since they don’t believe me.
Currently in Nov 2023 (25 years old, female), I decided to take my power back. Having minimal friends doesn’t matter, what matters is that I have my own back.  What keeps me going is still my obligation to provide for my family. I am still learning, but I would never give up. I have been attending counselling session to cope with my feelings and situation. What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger.  
Thanks for listening.

60759,107503,"Hello everyone. This is an Update from Post #105064.
I had written about my girlfriend's terminal illness and whether we should get married. I'm glad to say that we did manage to register our marriage, and even held a small reception with our closest family and friends. From her illness early stages, we try to create as many happy memories as we could, and did our best to fulfill as many of her bucket list wishes as time allowed. Unfortunately, we were unable to check off everything as she has passed on recently few days before her 24th birthday. Since then, I have been grieving and mourning. Her absence is too overwhelming for me and I find myself lost, unsure of how to proceed with my life now that my wife is no longer here. I really miss her so much. Waking up without her by my side, missing our shared daily activities, and no longer taking care of her has made me super empty and aimless. My closed ones keep comforting me telling me that my wife would not want me to be consumed by sadness and that I should try to move on but honestly, their advice is impossible. My Parents and Parents in law have been trying to console me but I refused to accept the reality. Because of this, I've found myself pushing them away. My wife's absence is really painful for me as we've been together since secondary school. I’m afraid that moving on will make me forget about her. Memories of her haunts me every day, and the thought of me forgetting about her has made me in denial. At this point, I can't even bear to look at her photos or her belongings without breaking down. Even writing this is really painful. I have seriously lost all motivations in my life and I'm struggling to cope with the events that has happened. I feel like grieving and mourning will be my new normal activity. I just don’t feel like doing anything anymore. Life is so unfair to me.
I thought that writing in this space can help me to release some suppressed emotions, and perhaps those who have gone through similar experiences could offer some guidance or support.
Thank you for reading this.

60768,107521,"Things I wished I knew when I graduated:
1. Prepare for interviews like how you prepare for exams. I learnt this the hard way. I thought interviews were suppose to measure how good you are at doing your job, but it really doesn't.
2. Ask for pay raise after your probation. If you are good at what you do, and better than everyone else, ask your boss for a senior/management salary. Bosses are usually not dumb, and will reward you accordingly.
3. Network well with your senior colleagues, the talented ones. Your colleague can become an executive of a unicorn, you can parachute your way there too if your relationship with them is a good one. But don't waste too much time with people from HR, Marketing and other fluff departments, most people in these departments are gonna be completely replaced by AI soon.
4. Start side hustles. Tuition, small business & more. This tiny income streams can really snowball to a huge sum down the road.
5. Invest most of your income. Don't keep your money rotting in bank. At least put it in cash funds, and have a sound investment plan, let AI handle it if you suck at managing finances.
6. Spend time with your family. Not your new bf/gf, but your parents & siblings. For the most of you, your parents are no longer going to be around when you finally have the time.
7. Spend less time here and on other social media platforms. And with that, you would have extra time for yourself. Nobody really cares about your daily life that you share, apart from the ones that you meet regularly.

60339,106592,"My mom cheated on my dad and they had a divorce during my O-Level year. I came home late one day because I was training for a race—I ran 100 and 200m—and a strange man walked out of her room. My dad was on an overseas business trip. I called my dad immediately and the divorce proceedings didn't take that long even when my mom was blaming my dad for being absent in the family because of work. My two siblings and I chose to move out of the apartment into a new apartment with my dad. My dad had one apartment which he conceded to my mom even though he paid every single penny for it.
It's been some years since I graduated with an FCH in applied math and I'm now in asset management and on a good income. For the past few months my mom kept trying to make contact with me to ask for money. She doesn't contact my brother and sister because they haven't spoken to her since the divorce. Since the divorce she dabbled in a few jobs and ultimately retired because she says she's too tired. She has a degree in accounting and she's was or is a CPA, I don't know how it works. She worked for PwC for several years before quitting to stay at home. She said she had to look after the kids when we had a domestic helper our whole childhoods and we were almost never home. I was in childcare until I was 7.
My dad dotes on us, pays for everything at home, and he alone paid for all three of our university tuitions, even for my brother, who went to medical school at the University of Sydney on no scholarship. My dad isn't that rich. He's been in risk-management at an insurance company his whole life. He just worked and worked and he loves us. Now that he's retired, he's finally had time to do things that he loves doing, which is to cook. So he decked out our kitchen with stainless steel commercial-grade kitchen equipment and he's just been making food. Last year on his 60th birthday, I bought him a custom French cooking suite, the kind that's used in fancy restaurants but smaller, I've never seen him so happy. I'm happy to see him being so happy.
I'm not on good talking terms with my mom although I still answer her calls. But she's never asked about my life, she's never asked about my dad, never asked about my siblings, all she does is complain about how hard her life is and how much money she has left. She has brought nothing but disaster to this family. She hurt us so much that my brother and I have zero interest now in being in any relationships and I doubt this will change. I really want this relationship I still have with my mom to end but I feel bad sometimes so I answer her calls.
Can someone please walk me through if I should learn to be more cold-hearted in this because every time I see her I see that man's face walking out of her room and my immediate desire then was I wanted to chuck something very heavy and very hard at his head, we had 4-foot vase in the living room then and I was already itching to do it but I held myself back.

60246,106371,"For the ladies out there who have never been in a relationship or dating before, as a female myself (25 yo, NUS alumni), I want to share on some important notes before you start dating or a relationship.
1) Actions from guys are more important than words. Yes, a guy may claim he miss you, text you good morning, say will bring you you to xxx, say will do xxx. If they are just saying without any actions done CONSISTENTLY, then it is just plainly talking.
2) Please don’t accept a relationship just because you are afraid to be alone or already in the so called “typical age range to get married” or most of your friends are attached. Rather to be alone than to be in a relationship/marriage suffering!!
Side track: according to book I read, the most important things in life for a lady are:
A) Health
B) Own savings
C) Family and Females Besties (see guy is not in the list)
3) Watch out for his body language. If a guy CONSISTENTLY:
A) Keep his phone/phone screen away from you
B) Disallow you from using his phone
Explanation for A and B: he does that because he has something fishy to hide.
C) Never want to put your couple picture as his dp or post on social media or even discourage you to do so. Delete your couple photos on his phone.
Explanation for C: He considers himself to be in the “bachelor” market. Means he is still looking around for his partner or even scared of people seeing you two together.
D) Always talk about himself and rarely entertain you
Explanation for D: One sided. He only want companionship. There should be give and take.
E) Always online on WhatsApp/Telegram but take 10000 years to reply your messages
No need to explain you should know why.
F) Say “none of your business”.
This is a major red flag. In a relationship, you all are supposed to work and listen together, not one don’t care about the other.
G) Don’t know what he wants in a relationship. Even after months.
H) Flirting and Cheating. When someone flirted and cheated although he has you, it means that your relationship is not that strong enough to begin and typically he will not suddenly change his heart overnight. So please do yourself a favour to distance away from him. Why tolerate someone like that?
I) Always texting a lot of female friends. Go to female friends’ house alone and not with a group of people.
J) Not willing to fork out money for meals/trips on YOU. If a guy is cash stripped because of his family situation (eg. Take care of family/pay loan/debt), it is understandable. Otherwise, the typical guy will always have more than money to spend on you on meals. Imagine a guy having difficulties parting with his money at the dating stage/while in a relationship, and imagine if you were to have kids with him, he definitely want you to spilt/pay for the hospital bills and baby accessories expenses. Would you ever want that?
Side note: a typical guy will chat with more than one girl online/in person. Please keep your eyes open and don’t put 100% heart into the relationship unless you feel reciprocated. Otherwise you will get hurt.
4) I suggest ladies to watch videos from Stephanspeaks YouTube Channel (yes I am a fan of him). From his channel, I learned that a guy who truly wants to be with you would put 100% effort and his heart to be with you. He will be willing to spend money and time with you. No excuses. No mind games. You will be his priority other than his job.
Thanks for reading up to here :). I have been in the above situations blindly until I woke up finally. It has been very heartbreaking for me since I put my 100% heart into it. I cried alot and felt depressed and I am recovering from it now. At least I am thankful for recognising it at the start of the relationship.

60865,107687,"TW: R*pe / SA. Need to ask everyone's opinion here. Also long story but please do read. 
So a guy (Let's call him Matt) and his gf (Let's call her Jenn) lives together. They've been doing good together, until one day, they argue about going to a night club. Let's just say Matt doesn't want Jenn to go to a night club cause he's worried about her safety.
But Jenn insist, saying she'll be just fine. Matt still wouldn't allow it. So they argued a lot. Jenn however, always find a way to go to the club. Either by lying about her location, made excuses, or simply just wait for Matt to fall asleep early. Everytime Matt found out, he'll get mad cause he's so worried about her. Jenn however, continued to do this like more than 10 times, and got caught by Matt at least 7 times. 
Matt is very forgiving, but even he has a limit. The only thing he doesn't want Jenn to do is to go to a night club. That's it. Nothing else. But Jenn didn't care. Matt told her, that if she goes there again, one more time, the relationship is over. Jenn, thinking it's just another chance, simply just go out anyways. She doesn't care anymore. 
Unfortunately for that night, after hours in the night club, she got r*ped and SAed by a guy there. She called Matt, crying, told him everything that happened. Matt immediately drove and picked her up, went to the hospital and police station immediately to make reports and gather all those evidence. Took hours, 
but thankfully, the evidence gathered are clear, and the police said for now, they can go home while they go make an arrest on the suspect. It was very late night at that point. 
Matt, however, drove Jenn back to her parents' house. Jenn feeling confused and asked why. Matt said that he's sorry about everything that happened to her and it's not her fault, however, he's a man of his word. He said that he did warned her that if she goes to the club one more time, the relationship is over. Regardless of what happens, even if she's safe and nothing bad happen, the relationship is still over. Matt did say that if she needed help about the case, he'll help. But that doesn't mean he and Jenn are together. 
He already packed every Jenn's belongings from his house the moment she walked out to go to the club. All of it is in the car, and he carried it for her to her parents'. Jenn, crying and begging, asking him not to leave her and said she won't do it again. Matt however, said that he has his limit too. And he said why does it need for this horrible thing to happen then only she'll listen. Before he leaves, he told her again, that he's sorry about what happened, and that if she needed any help with the case, he'll help. But that's it. 
So, the question is, is Matt wrong for doing what he did in the end?

61148,108278,"Response to #108252:
I’m one of Prof Ben’s former schoolmates at RI and this is a reply to his comment. I’ve been in the C-suite at a multinational for more than 10 years now I’m retired. I also graduated top 5 of my cohort at one of the most prestigious pure mathematics departments in the world. I think I am somewhat qualified to opine (at least on the industry side). I also don’t want this to sound like a rebuke, because it’s not. I actually agree with him on some level.
Agree that IQ matters a lot less the higher you go in most jobs. Yet, from what I gather, people with good management skills are a lot scarcer than people who are good technically. My company hired a lot of life science and biomedical science PhDs from Harvard, Stanford, Hopkins. You’d think these people are few and far between but we can always replace a scientist; it’s nearly impossible to replace a good middle manager. It is problematic because we have a million different ways to measure intellectual “horsepower” but we don’t have any metric for management skills. I don’t have a reliable way to find good managers. 
There are several takeaways from my career that I hope can be useful for the readers here. Aptitude does exist but it is a combination of what counts for raw intellectual power, interest, work ethic, and many other things we don’t yet know. It is easy to put it down as a simple “stupid-smart dichotomy.” In reality, not being interested in something or not putting in the work manifests rather similarly as not being smart enough. I had several schoolmates at university who were a lot smarter than me but they graduated in the bottom of the class. Not enough work, too much beer. 
Bear in mind, “geniuses work hard too.” In mathematics, the most famous in recent history is Terry Tao. A lowly math enthusiast like me couldn’t possibly be compared to the legend himself, but I’m pretty sure I’m closer to Terry in IQ than I am in industriousness or in inventiveness. In his early years, people would have probably spent less time awake than he spent doing math. Important to note: Ben was the best student not only because he has a good brain, he was also a peerless hard-worker. 
A couple of things about luck, which Ben mentioned as well. I knew at an early age that I will be doing a math degree. I did IMO and I liked doing math for fun. There was a straight line for me and it was out of pure luck that we are all taught math at a young age. If I had been a secret genius in marine micropaleontology, I would have perhaps ended up as a mediocre civil engineer with an exotic coral collection. Having said that, none of my jobs post-graduation had anything remotely to do with pure mathematics (number theory and algebraic geometry). 
The way people talk about IQ lacks a lot of nuance. IQ itself isn’t understood well and I have spent some time on the literature. There is still a lot to distill in that space. We don’t know how much of one’s ability to learn is explained by this concept of *brain power* and how much is explained by one’s dispositions and all behaviors related to the trait conscientiousness. Interest measures motivation and discipline is work without motivation. I do believe there is such a thing as innate smartness but I don’t know how useful it is apart from being a way to explain away why someone is putting in the work and not getting the result. It’s not the whole picture. There are many ways to look at this, one of which is pretty obvious—you’re working but it’s mostly unproductive work. If you stared at your textbook for 18 hours without intention, you’ve worked 18 hours but you learned nothing because your heart isn’t in it. Why isn’t your heart in it? Possibly because you chose CS after reading about $250,000 starting salaries at Google and not because you were even remotely interested. This has nothing to do with aptitude you’re just in the wrong place.
Being thoughtful about your interests is more important than just working hard. There’s no point pursuing a high-paying industry to be a 10th-percentile worker because there’s a chance you will make no more than a gas station attendant working the graveyard shift. The head of the business development division cleared $1.25M the last year I worked there. She majored in English at a Canadian university. Ben would probably think that her job doesn’t require a lot of IQ, but I wouldn’t survive a day in her shoes. She is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met precisely because she is able to pick up on nuances and cues that I just don’t. If you think about it this is kinda like everything else—some people just pick up certain things quicker than others. 
This brings me to my most important point, the term “intellectual horsepower” should be taken to mean field-specific intellectual horsepower or skill. I’m sure a generalized intellectual baseline exists but I believe that there is a much bigger variable component that is determined by other factors, including interest, discipline, and industriousness. Every single one of my friends who are now surgeons and doctors will fail my degree at my university. Likewise I will not make it through a medical degree. I find medicine incredibly boring. I also failed chemistry in secondary school. Question, how could you fail chemistry weren’t you an IMO medalist? The answer is simple—when I’m in a chemistry class I don’t understand s***. It’s entirely possible to be stupid in one area and very strong in another. It’s also possible to be stupid in all areas or strong in all areas. 
The important thing is to remember, whether you’re smart or not, whether you have aptitude or not, the strategy is the same—you work hard. If the strategy is the same, you don’t get hung up on what your brain power is. By the way, and this is not a dig, it’s curious that only those in academia keep talking about intelligence and brain power. Lower-beings like me? We got something way more interesting we use to overcompensate—frequent flyer miles.

60275,106447,"After working for 10 years, I think young uni students need to remind themselves that the industry is nothing like school. People who do very well in school will generally do much better than the average income earner, but there isn’t any reliable metric that we know of to predict how far up the corporate hierarchy you can go based on how well you’ve done in school. I work for a multinational, and the most successful Singaporean in the company, in fact one of the only non-American partner at the firm who is based in Singapore, was a poly student who graduated from Tasmania. One level down, and many of my Singaporean associate directors come from an enormous variety of backgrounds, none of whom did particularly well in school.
In Singapore, it is not uncommon to hear of young graduates from Cambridge or Oxford or an Ivy League university and it is easy to think that the competition is overwhelming. In reality we honestly don’t know how well these people will do. Being a very good student comes down to two things, natural intelligence and discipline. At work, many other traits are rewarded. It isn’t an asset to be sociable in school but the managing director of sales at our company made 700K last year. I worked on her team for a year and our job was primarily talking to customers and building relationships in the industry. Nothing technical. In school, if you’re the most technical person you’ll end up at MIT; at work, if you’re the most technical person it is rare that you will make management. If you do make management as a genius engineer it would have been for reasons other than your engineering skills.
Success in the world of business is even more varied. I have met owners of a small family business that make close to a million in profit every year from just managing rental properties for landlords. They clean, they market, they find tenants, and they earn a fee from doing it. I have met a marble dealer who made 2.5 million profit last year. I meet a lot of business owners because of my work in consulting.
It’s fine to be proud of scholastic achievements. It’s fine to pursue it hammer and tongs. But know that the world is enormous and people are rewarded for many skills and traits that many people would deem useless.

60767,107559,"I'm (M30) a rather successful social media influencer. But hear me out, it's not what you think it is.
My wife (F29) is someone who likes to talk about and shares whatever she sees on social media. She'll be doomscrolling TikTok the entire day, frequently sending me videos of influencers showing off their branded goods, having fun at holiday locations, etc and asking me when I will bring her there. Bitch please, I just left my cushy corporate job to start my own business, ain't nobody got time for that shit.
She was getting really annoying so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I decided to start influencing her social media feed. I used her laptop and to google for sports, crypto news, AI news, etc, stuff that I know she won't be interested in, searched for similar stuff on TikTok and started liking and following content creators she won't be interested in.
At first I thought it didn't work, but after a week I realized she wasn’t using TikTok that much and I asked her why. She complained that her feed was really boring and nothing she saw interested her. It was WORKING!
I decided to take things a step further by making her see stuff she's moderately interested in, yet is useful so that they'll slowly influence her lifestyle. She has gained a bit of weight since our wedding but she’s too lazy to start exercising, so I started using her account to follow some fitness and health influencers.
Guess what, a week later she dragged me to sign up for a gym membership together and booked some yoga classes. I’m pretty fit myself so I don’t really need that but I’m happy to see that she's doing something about her health. It has been a few months and she looks much healthier. I'm super happy with the results of my ""social media influencing"".
Guys, social media is such a powerful tool. Do try out ""social media influencing"" on your family/partners/kids and you might be surprised by the results.

I used to read NUSWhispers when I was in NUS. I recall during my first year in NUS, the posts were numbered less than 10k and I'm impressed by how much it has grown up to today. It's fascinating that a student project can get so much attention. So as a curious computing kid, I started building this dashboard. The data and code is open source. I worked on it intermittently for 2 years only when I felt like it. Along the way, I got to learn some React and python data tools. Why do I do this? I honestly don't know haha, just felt like completing it as my side project. I did set buying a road bike as a goal to motivate myself to complete this project. Now I can finally buy that bike!

60603,107106,"I have been reading stories about toxic parents, and parents who demand too much allowance. So I'm here to share my story. Just want to get this out of my chest.
Mother was divorced shortly after I was born. She then cohabited with a gambler who frequently molested my elder sister and me. We told her a few times that we were being molested, but the most she did was to tell the gambler that he must be careful in the way he touched us so that we won't call it molest. Had to live in fear everyday for more than 10 years until they spilt. Then she got together with another guy and they got married, so legally he is my stepfather. But I am totally not close to him.
My relationship with my mother wasn't good to begin with. Since young, I blamed her for not protecting me when I was molested for so many times. She was also very biased. She treated my sister much better than me. My elder sister always had new clothes and toys whereas I could only have hand-me-downs. I had to put up with her daily insults and she laid her hands on me even when I was in JC. She never scolded my sister before, no matter what my sister did. I had to do housework while my sister could slack at home the whole day. I could go on and on about the disparity in treatment.
Her attitude towards me slightly improved when I entered the workforce because I started to give her allowance. At first, I thought that I can finally have a loving mother and experience some family warmth. But I was wrong. After I got married and had kids, I told her that I could not give her as much allowance as before. Her attitude changed immediately. When I brought my kids over to visit her, she liked to criticise them just like how she insulted me when I was young. She has never bought any gifts for my kids. I dreaded bringing my kids over to her place because the vibe was always so negative and my kids were puzzled why their grandmother hated them so much. Then one day we had a big argument over money (she obviously wanted more money from me) and I decided that enough is enough. She is just seeing me as a money tree. Given how badly she treated me when I was young and how nasty she was to my kids, I felt that she does not deserve to receive another cent from me and I want to protect my kids from their toxic grandmother. So I cut off all contact with her.
In case you all are wondering whether she is acting this way because she didn't have enough allowance, I can tell you no. She has stopped working for the past 20 years and her monthly allowance from my stepfather, my sister and me was $3000. She is just a housewife who cooks dinner 3 times a week, spends most of her time sleeping at home (or flirting with other men outside, behind my stepfather's back). Yet she is getting $3000, more than the hawker centre cleaners who toil their back from morning till night. And she had the audacity to ask more money from me? It didn't occur to her that she had been mentally and physically abusing me since I was young?
It was that big argument that made me realised that I really hated her to the core all these years. After I cut off contact with her, I dreamt of her occasionally (I never dreamt of her before). And in all my dreams, I was venting my anger on her. I was scolding her all the things I wanted to say to her face in real life. I even slapped her in my dreams. I would wake up feeling angry because the dreams felt so realistic, but also quite satisfied that I 'got my revenge'.
I do feel that I am in a better place now. I don't need such a toxic mother to ruin my life and my kids' lives. I can have my own loving family, with me modeling what a good parent is to my kids.

60515,106933,"My advice to guys thinking of settling down and getting married - don't! You will regret it.
I too once thought I found the love of my life. That we will live happily ever after. I was so in love all the advice I've heard before fell on deaf ears. Don't repeat my mistakes!
Someone once told me that the biggest reason marriages fail is because women think that men will change after marriages but they don't. Men think that women wouldn't change, but they do.
And boy do they change... Within a few years, I can barely remember the woman I loved. And I'm not just talking appearance - it's the personality changes that scare me. Even her family commented that she is so different.
The once caring, gentle girl who was the light of my life is now my nightmare. Everything I do or don't do is wrong. Everything I say or don't say is wrong. Every wrong step she will dig up things from ages ago and stack them up.
Other than the 3 kids we have and love dearly, we are worse than roommates. Every time I thought we made progress, something trivial will trigger her and it's worse than ever.
So think twice, thrice, and 100 times before you jump the gun.

60278,106453,"To 106443. On the giving parents 1.2k rant.
I have to do a submission in order to comment because my entire ""family"" is on my fb.
I have the same toxicity family as you. And mind you, giving money is the least of my worry. I still have to do entire household chores taking turns with my sister while my own dad is watching youtube and mom playing phone games.
When i was still under one roof with them it was nightmare every day. I had to bug my bf to hurry up marry me and get me out of there. I was very stupid for me to tell them my salary of 3.6k back then and i started buying them gifts. And the ball dropped on me when they wanted allowance of $500 because they saw how well to do I am. On top of that, i have to pay for my mom's shopping spree on lazada and taobao because ""i dont know how to do online payment"". I damn regretted teaching her and showing her the good deals available. It is really bad during the 11/11 whatever sales.
So here's the thing on how i escape from these sick ""parents"" who treated me as an investment.
I stayed more in my bf's house, saying that it was nearer to workplace. I eventually got married, got my bto, 2 kids. I told my parents that im not paying them anything other than cny angbao. I have my own life to handle, bills to pay myself and guess what i asked for money from them. They dodge me all the way.
I mean i heck care. They went to manipulate my relatives saying how useless am i. They even refuse to take care of my bb. Refuse to help in house reno. Whatever. I do it myself with my husband & his family. And i never regret this move ever since. Honestly its good riddance since they are out of my life and waiting for me to fail. But i show them success and happy without them.
To any boomers who are about to comment how unfilial am i, think again.
If my parents didnt demand harshly, i would have spent lavishly on them, bring them out on holidays, more family time spent. But they made the whole thing so sour, spoil my image to all the relatives and friends, refuse to help in my confinement, playing with my kids, i think this is what strike the balance. Force me until i simply dont care anymore.

60316,106539,"Long story regarding my relationship, please bear with me as I’m looking to help couples that are going through this phase or eventually will go through it.
5 months ago, I decided to end things with my bf of 3 years. During our last quarrel, i felt that we were not compatible and I don’t see a future with him anymore. I’m looking for a guy that will treat me well, and he is not treating me the way I want to be treated. He is putting way too much priorities over his life and his friends over me. We only meet once a week and it probably was just dinner depending on availability and there were no new activities in our life and it felt that our whole relationship has gone into a stagnant phase, and both of us were not growing at all. Sparks started dying off, I felt like I deserved better, and eventually convinced myself to give up the relationship. And also to make things clear, there wasn’t abuse or cheating involved in our relationship.
2-3 weeks after the breakup(he continued trying for another 4-6weeks), he started coming back to beg me to stay, something that he would never have done for me before. He started saying sweet things like how our break up has affected him and how he can’t live without me. How much he wanted me back in his life and how he would change for me.
At that point of time, i still love him and care for him, but I think this relationship is not going to get anywhere, I spent weeks to convince myself that leaving is for the better good. I was overwhelmed with negative emotions and everything he said just turned me off. So of course I started ghosting him, and took weeks to reply him, despite him sending the long messages about how much he missed me and asking me to meet. Eventually he stopped trying.
I’m actually a stubbornly strong lady, the first two months of letting go, I was in pain, I still love him alot and can’t let go of him. But I told myself it’s going to get better without him. I forced myself to believe that it is over, I will have a better future ahead of me, I will find someone that will treat me better. Everyday, I told myself I will never return to my ex, I deserve better than him. The first month of no texting, I just felt neutral, it doesn’t hurt me as much, as I thought I have already moved on.
Fast forward to a month later after he stopped texting me, I broke down. The emptiness inside me start to swallow me up. I realised I can’t let go of him, I can’t give him up, my life is not the same without him. The months I spent to convince myself that he is not the right one, fell right through. I was in so much pain, I can’t sleep properly at night, I can’t even set my mind straight.
So finally last month, I let down my ego and reached out to him(lucky he didn’t blocked me). Turns out he is still waiting for me. He told me how happy he is to receive my text, he waited me for patiently all this while cause he felt like I needed the space. He never gave up on us despite my no replies and my resistance to meet him. And now we are back together. Spending the Christmas and New Year together.
He is totally a changed man now. He held to his promises so far for 2 months, I can see he really changed. He is putting his 101% into our relationship now. I guess this is where they say “only know how to treasure it when you lose it”. And the pain that I felt during the break, it’s something I never want to experience again, and I thank god for him not giving up on me during our break up period. In fact this break up period made us realise how much we love each other and strengthen our relationship even more.
To all the couples out there, if there were not lying, cheating, abusing in your relationship, even though at some point you lose all your spark and want to give up on the relationship, asked for a break up, it’s very normal, it’s part of life, sometimes it takes space to deepen your love for each other. If he seems sincere in coming back to your life, there is no harm trying again, at the very worst, you can breakup again in another 1-2 months if you noticed he didn’t change. Don’t let the ego of yourself of not going back to your Ex stand in the way, if he can drop his ego to beg for you to stay, likewise you can do the same.
At the end of the day, we just want a guy that is willing to love us, fight for us and never give up on us. It’s never easy for a guy to start begging a girl. Likewise, do not give up on your SO. Sometimes we can be really stupid and needs a breakup to realise what we really want. Of course that is if your SO, is still willing to fight for you. Good luck to all the couples out there and wish your relationship all the best!

60322,106559,"A lot of people seems fixated by which school you go to, the grades that you get, etc. I'm on a different track, especially when grooming my kid.
I teach him social interaction, empathy, identifying risks and problems, coming up with solutions, stamina, and perseverance and always have a backup plan.
I own and run a business with mid 8 figure revenue. I didn't graduated from the top schools for my undergrad degree. I make up for it taking up short courses at Ivy League schools. Even NUS, which turned out quite disappointing for the lacklustre quality of teaching staff.
And why I teach my son all these, and why I'm practising them. In running a business, we can always hire the Ivy Leagues to execute the business plans. But it takes more than the smart guys to run a business.
We need EQ to connect with people at a deep level, we need empathy to truly understand our customers and partners problems, we need out of the box thinking to come up with a solution as our customers and partners are staffed with the smart brains. We need gumption to ask stupid questions so that we can really dive deep and understand the issues. We need humility to talk to people.
So to everyone, think differently. Grades and pedigree are important, but to be the top 1%, it is way more than that.

60922,107835,"Today is my daughter’s 10th birthday, and sadly she doesn’t even know I exist.
One year after graduation, I met this wonderful girl and we clicked instantly. It only took a few months before we’re together officially. 3 months after we got together, she got pregnant. 
Panicked and feeling totally unprepared to be a husband and father, I asked her to abort the baby. She said we could afford it and insisted on keeping it, and that led to numerous heated arguments that caused the breakdown of our relationship. I was torn, I didn’t want the baby, but I couldn’t bear to lose her, so I didn’t break up with her immediately. Selfish and young me thought of the things that I might need to give up if I were to have the child, like I could no longer travel and go out with friends as and when I wanted, I’d have no time and less money to spend on my hobbies, and my career progression might be delayed. Also, I was hesitant about marrying someone I only knew for a few months, not sure if we’re really compatible, if we both could live peacefully together and gave our baby a loving environment to grow up in. For months I was in denial that this is happening and was so consumed by my own worries and fears, I ended up being absent throughout her pregnancy and decided to break up with her when she was eight months pregnant. She still messaged me on the day she gave birth, saying she wanted me to see and hold our baby because she believed it will change my mind. But I chose to ignore her. 
A year later, a mutual friend attended my daughter’s birthday party and told me how adorable and smart she has grown, and all of a sudden I felt immensely guilty and regretful for not being there for my own child. So I attempted to reconnect with my ex, but she refused to meet me. She said I had never been there for her during her toughest days when she needed me the most, and I had never contributed a single cent, what’s the point of letting such a heartless and irresponsible person back into her life now? She said I’m as good as dead, and she and our baby were thriving and happier without me. She then blocked me everywhere. I even went to the extent of dropping by her place to find her, but her parents chased me away and said I’m a horrible person and they’d never accept me as part of their family.
Recently, I found out she is now happily married to a rich startup owner and has a pair of twins with him. Meanwhile, I’ve been on dating app for years and still haven’t found anyone that compares to her. I still remember vividly how comfortable and loved she made me feel, how we both were so happy just doing simple stuff together like cooking and watching shows. I can sense most of my dates are only after my money and don’t genuinely care about me. I’ve been progressing quickly in my career and enjoy comfortable salary, I have freedom to travel anywhere and money to buy anything I want, and I’m moving into my own place soon,  but I still feel so empty. Since my peers are mostly married with kids by now and busy with their own families, I barely have anyone to hang out with and I start yearning for a family of my own. Deep inside I feel perhaps I get bad karma for abandoning my partner and child 10 years ago. Perhaps the universe will never grant me another child and I will die alone, I guess I deserve it. I deeply regretted my decision back then and will live in guilt for the rest of my life. Each year on my daughter’s birthday, I will think of her and cry myself to sleep. How can you miss someone so much when you never even meet them?
To anyone dealing with unplanned pregnancy, I hope my story will enlighten you. Please make your decision wisely. Unless there are medical reasons, financial difficulties, or irreconcilable differences as a couple, please try your best to work things out with your partners, bring your child to this world and be there for them. 
Anyway, will just leave a note for my ex here since she was from NUS and may follow this page.
Dear A, 
I guess by now my apology won’t matter anymore, but I still want to say I’m very sorry. I should never have left you and our daughter and gave up on us. I’m glad you now have a big happy family that you’ve always wanted. I still care for you and our daughter and I really look up to you for being such a capable mother. If our paths ever cross
again and we are fated to be together again, maybe in another life, I promise to be a better man for you.
Love,
S

Funny you should say that. I’ve also been working for around 10 years now. I just attended a JC reunion, went to RJ, and the most successful person was the person I least expected to make anything of himself, mostly because he flunked out of J1. Let’s call him Nick. From what I remember, he took his A levels as a private candidate or something, and he got into NTU. Then he dropped out of NTU and became a real estate agent. Shortly after, he started to write a condo management software which he built for several years before selling it recently for a lot of money to an Australian company. I don’t know the exact amount but it was 8 figures and I didn’t even hear it from him. I had a lawyer friend who was on the M&A team for this deal.
Many of my classmates went to top overseas universities. I myself went to NYU for chemical and bio engineering and did my MBA at UChicago. I just hit a 5-figure monthly last year and I traded an arm and a leg for it. I was around 75th percentile at RJ and barring the scholars, all the best students seem to be doing alright but not spectacularly.
Nick didn’t only flunk out, he was one of the most disruptive jokers and pranksters at RI. I knew him since I was sec 3 and he was always trying to crack jokes in class, he was dozing off all the time, he pulled childish pranks on classmates, he cheats during exams, he copies homework, he made a habit out of playing hooky. As a close friend of his, it never occurred to me that he wasn’t smart. He was just about as bright as anyone I met at RI. You can tell this by just talking to him. He just had a different personality.
So it is true that we haven't the faintest idea who will make it big and who will not. We do know that if you do well in school the probability that you will be middle-class is high. But it takes a lot more fairy dust to go higher than that.

To the lady who wants to break up with her bf.
My parents are in a similar situation. My father have big dreams of doing start ups and creating businesses but all of his ideas have failed. My mother was the one supporting the family and pouring money into his ventures. Watching my mother worry about finances and putting food on the table, on top of taking care of him, me and my sibling, had made me start to resent my father for being a useless dreamer. He doesn't even do anything at home. Typical MCP and expects us to serve him when he's around just because he's a man. He's not a man in my eyes. My mother is a superhero because she stepped up and became the breadwinner instead. She did everything that he didn't do for the family.
His ego wouldn't let him accept that he's not cut out to be a boss of anything so he would always boast of all the ideas that he have. He has worked part time or temp jobs on an irregular basis because my mother has grown frustrated taking care of this man child. The least he could do is earn his own pocket money. Both my parents grew bitter and my dad moved to some woman's house. I know he cheated on my mum too. They finally got a divorce. I'm so happy for my mom to be free of him.
When I've started working, my dad tried to make me invest in his businesses. I expected him to flop so I only gave him what I can afford to sign off else he would be bothering my mother or my sister instead. Whatever little he made or ever earned he would splurge it on himself. In my eyes, he's just a sperm donor.
I'm not saying your bf will turn out to be just like my dad. Without respect, it's hard to love. Having children under these kind of circumstances would be cruel to everyone.
Your bf may or may not succeed later in life. It does not matter anymore as you are suffering already. The truth is the both of you are no longer compatible. But things did not go so bad all this while so there was no reason to think of breaking up until you realised he wanted to make you his legal wife.
Ignore all those who bash you as they are not living your life. He's not your responsibility to take care for life! Being single is better than being with someone you no longer respect. Be free from him! I support you.

60389,106692,"Valentine Day is around the corner. Looking back, there are many things that I want to share.
Throwback to two years ago, 23 years old, I never had a boyfriend. I am that kind of girl with pimples and oily skin. I deemed myself to be single.
Throwback to one year ago, 24 years old, I had my first boyfriend. A boyfriend who loves you for who you are, when he tells you you look better without makeup. A boyfriend who accompanies you ups and downs. However, as a ladies man, he was talking to other girls too. I was unable to accept it and the relationship fell apart.
Currently, I am in a loving relationship with my fiance. He is everything I wanted, smart, caring, generous and kind. Most importantly, treats you well, protects you and encourages you. What I want to say is don't lose hope. A failed relationship does not mean that you are doomed. Be at your very best, be yourself and you will attract the right one. No mind games, no forced convo, and everything just flows.

60787,107554,"How do you normally deal with those who look down on you?
We are a family of 3 and stay in HDB and do not own car. We are not into brandrd stuff as well. We live a simple life. We dont even have driving license because we dont think it is necessary yet as the public transport in SG is already very convenient and good.
However, we travel pretty often. We mostly travel during school holiday. In addition, like once or twice we will go to europe during school holidays.
This is the problem.
Some of our circle of friends often ask us this:
""How come you can go europe few times? Its not cheap right. How do you do it?""
""Eh why don't you buy the BTO in this place? This is very good but its pretty expensive though. Like 800k larrr..""
""Wah your job can earn that much meh till can go to europe?""
So this is the thing. Our household income exceeds the maximum BTO income ceiling. Its not we do not want to buy or cannot afford to buy. We are not eligible to buy BTO. But we cannot be telling them this as we feel it sounds too bragging.
We go to Europe every year is exactly because we stay in HDB and do not own cars/other expensive expenses. To be honest, we do not even have to spend a single cash for our HDB because our monthly morgage is paid off by my husband's monthly CPF. So the gross salary we receive every month is solely for our savings and monthly groceries/expenses. So it is safe to say, our most monthly expensive expense is only our HDB mortgage. Our only debt is our HDB. This is why we have some spare cash for our luxurious travel.
If they ask us once or twice in a while, i think its fine. But they ask us everytime they meet us, it is pretty bothering.
Is it just because you live in HDB, do not live in Condo do not own cars in SG snd not into branded stuff, you are considered ""poor""?

60902,107783,"I wanna know all of your thoughts about this. All of you, read this.
At the time of posting, there's a TikTok video that went viral about this couple in a car while they were on a drive thru, waiting for their food. 
So the bf was scrolling ig and happens that a pretty attractive woman's photo, possibly his old friend, appeared on his feed. Gf saw that, and asked, ""Why didn't you try to get her?"", to which he replies ""Cause I know I couldn't in the first place"". Gf then proceed to ask him to elaborate, to which he says ""Cause I know myself. I know my level. So I'm not interested to try"".
Apparently, this respond hurts the gf. The gf the says ""When you say that, you're saying that that woman is on such a high level that you couldn't get her. So which means you're saying I'm such a low level"". Bf then says ""No, that's not what I mean"". The conversation was cut when they got their food, and video ended there.
It went viral and so many people, typically women, be saying ""Omg your bf is such a red flag!!! You deserve better Queen!!!! You need to leave him!!! He doesn't appreciate you!!!"", and more similar comments. Because they went viral, the bf started to believe that maybe he's not right for her, thanks to the negative comments. He then peacefully broke up with her and requested the gifts he gave he to be returned to him. All those gifts were really expensive too. iPad, Air Pods, Marshall speaker, and many more expensive items. 
So what's your thoughts? 
Here's mine : The gf is at fault and wrong. 
I'm probably gonna be the only woman going against her, but I don't agree with her at all. Like first off, she asked the question, so expect getting the answer from his heart. I know she wants the bf to say things like ""Cause I already have you"" or ""You're way better than her"" or whatever sweet cringe bullshit. But instead, he gave out his deep truth, he says that she was out of his league, so he has self-awareness of his on level. Cause come on, in life, there's always, and I mean ALWAYS gonna be someone better than you. Some don't even have any self-awareness and acted like a douche and became a self-entitled piece of shit that believes they deserve better, when they don't even bring anything to the table (Looking at you, toxic modern feminist). So I respect the bf for speaking up on his insecurities.
But what did the gf do? Instead of understanding his point, she's making it all about her. Started questioning if she's a ""low level"" to him instead of thinking ""I see. That's understandable cause even I know there's guy out there that's way too high level for me to bother."" 0 understanding. She even recorded it and posted it on TikTok all for views, and that hurts and pressures the bf so bad, he blames himself for not being ""good enough"" for her and broke up with her. 
It's reportedly the guy has been a great bf. The gifts were one of the proofs. So what stupid reassurance and validation the gf need from him to say she higher level or not? It's not like the gf is any ""higher"" level, there's always gonna be someone else better but yet the bf chose her and committed to her. 
My husband and I had this conversation before and I wasn't mad at all. He is honest, and I know I'm not a supermodel kind. But the fact he chose me is the thing I will forever appreciate. Y'all who keep picking fights out of thin air and making it about yourself are nothing but losers like gooooooosssssh get a life ????????????????????????????????????????
If the situation was reversed, where the bf ask why don't she try to get a super hot popular tall rich friend of hers, and if she says ""Cause I know my level. He's out of my league"", the bf is expected to accept it as it is and not making any issues out of it. Cause if he makes an issue and show that he is insecure, suddenly he's toxic, he's a huge ""redflag"", he has ""small d*ick energy"" like whaaaaaaat ???????????????????????????????????????? Its wrong if men do it but it's okay if women do it. And women still cry about ""equality"" ????????????????????????????????????????
Then y'all wonder why no one wants you ????????????
Then y'all wonder why there's no more good men ????????????
Then y'all wonder why you're so lonely ????????????
This is why I will always be hated by women. I don't care if I'm a woman, but I will never support the idea of saying ""Men are always wrong"" or ""Men are evil"" from women. Look at yourself in the mirror and fix that shit first before you go and attack men. 
Get a life and touch some grass ????????????????????????????????????????

60378,106669,"Is life really better in the 80s/ early 90s in sg?
I saw many old pics of sg during that period but couldn't tell how life was life was back then as an average singaporean. Most of what I heard were from my parents and older relatives.
Cost of living was lower but so were salaries. Many in the workforce did not even have a diploma. Stuff like vacations and domestic helpers were luxuries. Mcdonalds and KFC meals were special treats.
Most flats were smaller and some families had 6-7 ppl cramping in a 2/3 room flat.
Taking photos were a big thing and videos were almost non-existent. Even so, most families dont own a camera. Unlike now where you can take hundreds of photos and videos on a single outing.
No netflix and youtube so you had to accept wtv was fed to you on tv.
No internet and mobile phones. School projects meant days and weeks of digging books in the library. No google and online reviews so finding a product or service was based on hearsay and referrals. No whatsapp and video calls so if you had someone who lived overseas, that once a week phone call was the only way of connecting with him. Buying stuff overseas was next to impossible unless you or someone flies there.
But they did say life was simpler, less stressful and everyone was much friendlier despite not having much.

60296,106497,"I was just 17 years old when my life fell apart. It all started with my first boyfriend. He was my age, and we had been dating for a few months. I thought he was the one, but I was wrong. He got me pregnant twice and I had to get abortions both times. It was a difficult and painful experience, but I thought it was all worth it for love.
My second boyfriend was 9 years older than me. I thought he would be more mature and responsible, but he ended up being just as bad as my first boyfriend. He was controlling and manipulative, and I couldn't get away from him fast enough.
My third boyfriend was only 5 years older than me, but he was the worst of them all. He played me like a fool and left me feeling used and worthless.
I was so focused on my relationships that I neglected everything else in my life. I used to vape and smoke a lot, and it affected my studies. I did very badly for my O levels, only getting 39 points. It was a far cry from the 213 points I got for my PSLE. I was in Secondary 5 when I took my O levels, and everything went downhill from there.
I was a Chinese girl and I thought I was fairly good-looking, but it didn't seem to matter. I thought that love would be the answer to everything, but it only brought me pain and misery. I couldn't help but feel like my life was ruined. I felt like I had nothing left to live for.
I used to be such a hopeful and optimistic person, but after all that had happened to me, I couldn't see the point in anything anymore. I felt like I was just a shell of my former self, and I didn't know how to move on.
I couldn't help but blame myself for everything that had happened. I thought maybe if I had made different choices, things would have turned out differently. But it was too late for that now. I was stuck in a cycle of regret and self-loathing, and I didn't know how to break free from it.
I wish I had known then what I know now. I wish I had realized that love isn't always enough, and that you have to take care of yourself first and foremost. But it's too late for me now, and I'm left to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.

61133,108252,"I came across one of Ben's old threads about aptitude and I would like to share a story. Make of it what you will.
I am not smart. I went to a neighborhood school after Nanyang Primary because I flunk my PSLE. I then did poorly for my O-levels. I hated school. I hated everything about it. I hated sitting in the same classroom for hours every day, I hated doing homework, I hated working on practice problems etc. I didn't know why I was a bad student then. I've always put it down to what people have always said about me—I'm stupid. I went straight to NS.
But I did like one thing—chess. I would spend hours playing chess on the computer, hours reading chess books, hours practicing openings and endgames, hours reading about past games of famous players. I have no talent in chess. For 3 straight years upon my first introduction to the game in primary school by my father, I lost to him. He was not a chess player. By the end of secondary school (evidently at the expense of my school work), I was competing in tournaments and beating the majority of my opponents. This was my first life lesson in how one can overcome his lack of talent. 
At 18 I decided that I wanted to focus on my studies to get into a good university. Probably important to note, my parents are very rich. After communicating this to them, I set chess aside, retook my O-levels, did well, and they sent me to attend an IB program in the UK. It was hard. My brain was slow, my attention span was poor, but I did want to succeed and that made me persist. I put myself on an extremely rigid schedule and I averaged 6 hours a sleep for two years straight. I took no days off. The result of this was a perfect 45/45 and I made it to a top 2 engineering school in the US. I'm also an FM and I play for the university chess team.
Note: I am still stupid. I always leave lectures with the feeling of ""I have no idea what I just sat through."" I typically have to spend several days mulling stuff over, working through practice problems, even re-watching old lectures of my introductory classes because I forget stuff. Since I been at college, I don't average 6 hours of sleep every day. I sneak 30-min naps throughout a day but I do pull all-nighters regularly. This doesn't seem to be the case with most of my peers, but I have definitely met people here who are here simply by virtue of their relentlessness.
Hard work can compensate for bad hardware to some degree. What Ben said was consistent with my experience. Smart kids do learn a lot quicker. If you're both smart and a workaholic, you'd probably be as good a student as Ben was. But for those who are lugging a Pentium chip, if you want to make it, you just have to sacrifice everything and work. And perhaps this is how I got in at my college in the first place. This is a place where students are known for their almost masochistic work ethic.
Now that I've started working, I am the associate partner at my firm. How did I get here? Simple. I don't stop working. I am first to arrive and last to leave. It has worked for my all my life and there's no reason why it shouldn't continue. You just work. There's no reason why you should spend time mulling over whether you have aptitude or not.

60392,106699,"How can I reject my boyfriend's marriage proposal in the least hurtful way possible? I (25F) and my boyfriend K (26M) have known each other since JC and have dated for 4 years. He has always been good to me, treats me well, and I have no doubt that he loves me very much. Recently, I heard from a friend that he has been shopping around for engagement rings and planning for a surprise proposal. Although this should have been happy news for most girls, I actually felt worried, sad and confused instead.
The truth is, deep down inside I fear that I may have already fallen out of love with K. All my life I have been an (almost) straight As student and usually scored in the top 10-20% of the cohort. I am quite ambitious and competitive in my outlook, and some might even call me an overachiever. Since graduation, I have secured a pretty cushy job that pays close to 5 digits with high hopes for my future career progression.
K is quite the opposite academically. Back in school he was a bit of a joker and would rather spend his days hanging out with friends than revising. Although he was in a good school, his grades consistently scraped the bottom of the barrel and he said he ""just wasn't cut out for studying"". Despite this, K actually has very lofty goals and holds himself to (his own) high standards. He has always talked about his dreams of making it big as an entrepreneur and to be his own boss by the age of 30.
Although I desperately want to be supportive of his dreams, honestly I find many of his business ideas naive, ill-conceived and financially unfeasible. I tried my best to rescue several of his past ""big ideas"" by helping him research business regulations, liaise with industry partners etc. Yet, all of them turned a massive flop because they were fundamentally flawed to begin with. As he fast approaches 30, I think reality is sinking in that he is unlikely to reach his goal and will be stuck in his 3k/month admin job forever. In the past year or so, he has been showing signs of depression such as chronic oversleeping and self-destructive thoughts which has further sucked him into a downward spiral. I suspect that his pride is also wounded by the ever-widening gap between our life trajectories as he would refuse to come to company D&Ds with me as my +1.
I feel that my love for K has been slowly whittled down by the endless cycle of his doomed entrepreneurial ventures. I am exhausted from juggling multiple hats as girlfriend, therapist and business consultant. At the risk of sounding materialistic, I also find it hard to see a future with him buying a house and raising kids with equal financial contributions as I will probably end up paying for the bulk of it while also trying to protect his pride. With that being said, I will always care deeply for K given all the happy times we have shared together and everything he has done for me. He is a good and kind man who truly loves me with all of his heart, and I don't want to crush him completely especially given the current rut he is in. How can I let him down as gently as possible about his plans for a proposal, and would it be cruel for me to ask for a break/ a break up now?

60858,107672,"Prof Ben,
This will be a rather unique message to the ones you typically receive because I don’t have a question for you. What I do have is a thank you. Thank you for saving my life.
When I was at NUS, I was a struggling student; not because I was getting bad grades, but because I chose a course for the income and prestige not because it was a natural choice for me. I was in NUS med. Yet I was always better with languages than I was in science. I did well out of just a good mastery of studying techniques but I wasn't interested in the medicine nor any of the biological sciences.  
The other reason why I forced myself to enroll in medicine was because I was always under the impression that only the smartest people did medicine. My brother was doing medicine at Imperial at the time and I just really didn't want to lose. It didn't help that my dad was a cardiothoracic surgeon and my mom is a scientist at a biotech company. Nobody forced me to take medicine, it was my choice.
I hated every second of it. By the end of the third year, I genuinely wanted to kill myself. I was in such a dark place because even though I was doing well in school, I had zero passion for the subject. But I was in so deep at that point I thought that I was going to spend the rest of my life doing this. One dark night, I almost had enough Ibuprofen to overdose, but I stopped myself. I spent that night crying in the bomb shelter of my house. 
Out of a desperate search for an identity, I borrowed some of the legal textbooks of my best friend and I discovered a real love for the subject, in particular, American constitutional law. After a few months of getting into deep conversations with my friend, I was hooked. At the same time, I came across a piece that you wrote about perfectly intelligent people being good at one thing but not another. I just didn't have the stamina for medicine mostly because I did not have the slightest interest in seeing another picture of a scrotal fungal infection.
I decided to sit down for ultimatum talks with my parents to allow me to drop out. Because I had been out of sorts for at least 3 years by then, it was more of a relief to my dad that I had that conversation with him. He told me that he was going to support me regardless of what I wanted to do. I dropped out. I did some research and I decided that I wanted to do law in the US. I didn't want to do a gap year, so I picked a small state school with rolling admissions and unrestricted semester course loads and I finished my 4-year degree in political science and philosophy in 2.5 years. Guess what? This fall will be my last year at Harvard Law. I plan to do a doctorate and go into teaching.
The main takeaway from this is the fact that not only should people not beat themselves up over not having a gift to be good at their chosen ""thing,"" even if one has indeed been good at something, it doesn't mean that it is what they ought to be doing. People called a witch-hunt for you earlier this year because I think people fundamentally mistook you for allegedly claiming that people without an aptitude in one thing are stupid and will never be good at anything. Even though I don't doubt that there could be people who are mediocre at everything, there will always be something that they could do that they will have more passion and talent at than every other thing. Do that.

People never learn from history. From the dot com bubble burst in 2000, life science hype during early 2000s, chemical engineering in the late 2000s, the cycle just keep repeating itself.

60484,106878,"Hello,
NUS SoC alumni here. TL;DR started a startup, declined an acquisition offer last year and the business is growing. This is not about the startup, this is a tribute to my parents.
When we decided to not get acquired last year at the last minute, we had run out of money. It was a gut decision and we did not have backup options for fundraise. I felt it was right and my parents supported me. My dad said I should not think about anything below $100Mn.
Since we were not profitable and I was hearing NOs from investors, I was worried about how to pay salaries. My parents stepped in and gave me some cash which helped support the team. All this while, they have been paying my living expenses (I stopped taking salary of course). They paid me to fly in the region to meet customers.
I had a dispute with my flatmate and they paid for my rental when he decided to make me pay for renovation etc. upfront. They told me to stand up for myself and not get bullied. They transferred me the money and got one of their friends to bring some cash for me next week to help with living expenses.
My brother is in SF and works for FAANG, so all my groceries and grab are on his card. My parents would not let him pay for my rent etc. and he is free to live his life. He lives in a luxury apartment with a cat and does not have to worry. He can spend all his time and focus on his work.
The thing is that my mom is a housewife and my dad is a salaried employee in a developing country. They already used some of the savings to get me to NUS. I had a full scholarship at NTU but I really wanted to go to NOC, so they let me go to NUS. I never could qualify for NOC (rejected 4 times) and my parents never mentioned it once. My dad stayed with me for 15 days when I first came to Singapore thirteen years ago because I was only 15 and made sure everything was okay.
They supported me in continuing to live out my entrepreneurial dream. I got slightly disillusioned in between and gave some interviews to FAANG and had one very good offer. When I shared this with them, they would just tell me to do what I want. And I could not convince myself to take up a job because it would prevent me from having a shot at being somebody who history remembers.
I did not know earlier but know now that they actually sold off their property and took loans to pay for me. I would never have known had I not chanced upon the opened post on our dining room table while I was home. I have no idea what I did in my last life to deserve such parents. I do not. And I do not know what the future will be. We are profitable and growing now but I still do not take a salary. We have a lead investor etc. and I likely will be able to pay myself a little bit in the coming months.
I am not sure if I will ever be able to repay them. I screwed up so many times in university life and even while doing the startup - slacking off, doing random things like picking up chess, not showing up to meetings on time etc.. They would scold me a little for all of this but would never ever tell me money is a problem. I never had that burden and if I knew about what they have done, I would have taken up a job. My mom always asks me if I am eating and exercising right, never about how much I am spending.
If you see someone trying to be successful on their own, don't just think of their work or preseverance. The real MVPs might be their parents. They would never get the glory. And they would never ask for something in return. I love my mom and dad so much, and I will still be pulling their leg or not calling them. They would not want me to know and that is how it shall be.

Honestly, the only saving grace is the guaranteed promotion annually if you don't fuck up.
But is it worth it? Because factor that in, the pay is still miserable and the hours are still shitty. So why join Big 4 for the guaranteed promotion?
Not to mention:
The pay is low, and the hours are long. You have to work on weekends, be it whether you are forced by the manager/partner, or that you are so afraid that you cannot complete your work on time because of the ridiculous deadline with the growing shortage of staff that you turn your computer on to catch up on saturdays/sundays. I had worked 14 hours a day for 6-7 days a week for the last 6 months.

60786,107553,"My dad is a business owner, self made man. Growing up, he raised my younger sister and I to be capable and independent. My dad absolutely detest ""useless"" (acc to him) people and this translated into our upbringing. He has been scarred by useless children of his rich business associates. Long story short, only 2 points are applicable to this story.
1. He will cut us off financially when we turn 21.
We can still stay at home rent free, but nothing else. We don't have to give parents monthly allowance coz acc to him, the amount is peanuts and he would rather we use it to be independent. If we retain and did not graduate uni by 21, too bad, we will have to pay the remaining school fees on our own.
2. If we are not 100% independent by 30, he will write us out of the will.
Independent means having our own home (rented or bought doesn't matter) and having enough money to feed ourselves.
As a results, I worked by butt off growing up, I chose not to go to uni to work earlier and ended up studying part time for my degree. I studied a course that I did not like, but it's practical. I bto-ed with my husband and now, before 30, we have our own house, kid and pretty good life. I sacrificed, did what was smart rather than what I liked, during my early 20s while my friends were enjoying ""uni life"".
My younger sister will be graduating uni this year (graduated actually). She chose her course based on ""passion"" and now have difficulties finding a job. She enjoyed her uni life a bit too much and took on a study loan when she turned 21, and delayed her graduation a few times. Therefore, now she has no money, in debt and no job. There's no way she will be able to fulfil the independence criteria by the age of 30.
She went back to ask dad for financial help. Dad refused at first and then said he can help only if I approve, as I followed the rules. Changing the rules halfway will be an insult to the hard work and sacrifices I made.
Should I give my approval?
PS, I decided against it. People need to know the consequences of their actions, especially if this has been discussed since birth.

60252,106385,"Depressing story time. You know how in school your teachers tell you that hard work is most important than intelligence? I used to believe that until I got into uni.
My PSLE 100+ almost went NT but got into NA stream. A lot of my classmates are typical pai kia, smoke in toilet, don’t go school and fake MC, have sex in school. I’m the more guai type, study hard, attend all my class but just shit at study. Maybe I stupid, idk, sometimes I see my other classmates sleep in class all day, never go school, never do homework but exam time results is same or better than me and it make me very angry, why I just cannot understand how to study?? My father kena fired that time, no money send me tuition but my teachers always offer help, give me extra tuition after school. My outside friends all also very help me, give me their school notes and past year exam papers. They all very smart, go atas school and express.
N level ok, O level not bad can go poly. At first want to challenge myself, purposely choose harder course. School alumni team even ask me go back talk to the NA NT tell them about my success into going poly.
Few months in results like shit again, lecturer also advice me maybe this course not my calling, not suited for my skills so change to easy course, close both eye also can pass that kind. Again study very hard, go to all my lecture always ask question and after school mug until last bus home then go home. Everyone told me I age a lot. My outside friends all also ask if I ok because I look like shit. No matter how hard I also pia because my family not rich, cannot afford change course then drop out, unlike my outside friends can go overseas do masters do this do that idw sound jealous but actually I quite jealous them.
Meet up with outside friends, all grad already, always talk about their work life, their job, marriage plan, BTO. I sit there like idiot because I 3 years behind everyone. They not purposely make me feel like shit, also give me a lot advice like do internship, do online course and build up CV all. Meanwhile I still over here studying like dog no time do internship or online course.
After mugging like shit for years, surprise surprise, average result. Fuck. 90% my course mate don’t even go lecture, always ask me and others help take attendance, but still results come back half of them better than me. Fuck. Really fuck, IQ 0 EQ also 0. Reaching 30 years old finally got 1 gf at 20+++ actually is I feel like I just anyhow settle for a gf because parents worried I gay or cannot get married so I shoot my shot with every girl. After that find out she also feel the same, just settle with me like I’m rebound because she just break up with her bf and want get back at him. We still in rs but sometimes feel like we just lonely together aiya that’s another story for another time.
Keep applying job, kena rejected by 99.999% company, only lanjiao insurance scammer give me call back. All the company tell me I no experience so cannot. Eventually bo bian settle for internship $800 a month while my outside friends working lawyer, doctor, banker all making 5-10 times more than me, probably even more.
How? Hard work? PUI! Hard work can put food on table? Can do well in school, get good job? Joke. I accepted already I just stupid. Think my big take away is the reason why is call “success story” because it almost never fucking happen.
Maybe make me better person? Can eat a lot of shit 吃苦大王 too bad in life king of eating shit get shit eating job and shit eating life.

60651,107226,"My boyfriend suggested me to join him and his family on a 2d1n Batam trip to celebrate Mother's Day. I casually agreed cause i'm available and free on that day too.
Upon buying the ticket, I asked him if we can go for a 1h message. Which he deny as he say we can only do stuff the mum wants to do as this is a celebration for her. Thus we should not do our own things.
Then i proceed to ask if late at night, when everyone is asleep can we at least spend some couple time, which he also deny. Cause he say he don't want his family seeing or hearing us.
I kind of regret agreeing to go cause he say this trip should be a bonding trip with his family. So now im wondering who is his mother? Cause it sounds like my 2d1n gotta revolve around this 'queen' -.-""

60273,106443,"Disclaimer: rant ahead.
I graduated a year ago and have a full time job earning about 4k/mth. I've been working since uni to support myself and hardly asked my family for money. But since I started working, my family asked me for about 1.2k/mth as allowance. It's not that I can't spare the cash since I'm quite frugal but I'm just tired of how they will remind/ chase me for the money if I'm late. I don't know what's their obsession with the money. When I bring up my financial situation, they will say they also don't have money and that I should just give. In the end, I'll just pay to avoid the arguments and drama. This is too exhausting.
Thanks for listening to the rant.

60713,107387,"My husband and I met in NUS and have been married for afew years. He recently started golfing on weekends and I’m somewhat upset cus hes basically gone for half the weekend, like totally radio silence no text no call nothing on golf days. Anyway, one day I decided to prank him by hiding his gloves hoping to see if he will text me to ask if I’ve seen it, but NO he did not text at all, and I found it puzzling cus he complained about getting blisters in the past if he didn’t use gloves. We never ever had trust issues but this actly got me paranoid and worried.
So, the next weekend I threw my air tag into his bag to check up on him. And my heart sank. He was totally not in any driving range or 9 hole but in some random housing estate. I waited for an hour anxiously before deciding to Grab there to confront him. Heng it was a landed property area so I could identify which house it was from the GPS. When I went up to the gate, figuring out if I should ring the bell, someone tapped me on the shoulder and when I turned around, I just blew up. I saw my husband’s best friend’s GF, in PJs and holding random dabao.
Never in my wildest nightmares did I imagine I’d be in such a situation. I started accusing her of monstrous stuff, and how homewreckers destroy lives and shit, and as I went on I noticed shock on her face slowly turn into confusion and then finally into -_-“. When I stopped to catch my breath, she just opened the gate and said come in and see for yourself.
When I entered the house, there my husband was, seated at the dining table, with 4 of his other guy friends, all with their laptops out, playing dota. Long story short, he started golfing after I got mad at him to stop playing stupid computer games as an adult, but I guess everyone needs their own hobbies. Yea…

61118,108225,"I need to confess...
I met my wife 5 years back ago, when we were about to graduate. The first time I saw her, I told to myself ""She's the girl I want to marry. She's the girl I want by my side. She's the girl I want to protect."" But she was taken at that time.
A part of me felt so lost and wanted her so badly. A part of me felt I shouldn't disturb her and I should move on. I couldn't. So I stalked all her social media, be friends with her friends and got introduced as a ""mutual friend"". When we officially met for the first time, things were already not looking good between she and her boyfriend at the time. I took my chance to fill his spot and constantly gave her my support, my love. And eventually, she fell in love with as well. She decided to break it off with her then-boyfriend, although she didn't know I knew everything about her prior beforehand thus I was able to be the perfect listener for her. 
As we got together and with marriage coming into my mind but she was still not ready, I did a bold decision. I babytrapped her on purpose as I thought, ""with our kid, she will be with me forever. She will never leave me and she HAS TO marry me"". In the end she was furious when she got pregnant, but quickly let go of the issue as she thought we are both responsible. 
Flashback to now looking at our 3 years old daughter and her, she's still the same girl I want to take care for the rest of my life. Although we are financially stable and have a happy family right now while even waiting for our BTO, I feel so extremely guilty. I felt she will hate me, if she knew what really happened. I know I will probably take this secret to my grave, although I will have to carry this guilt for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry, but I love you too much. I know I was selfish, but I will spend the rest of my life making up to you.
