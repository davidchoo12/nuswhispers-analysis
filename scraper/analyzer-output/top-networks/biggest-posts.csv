Unfortunately for you, I think I know the guy you speak of personally. If I may be correct, he is indeed harsh, hard to talk to and strange. He may be smart but has so many faults that I don't know where to start from. I was so pissed with debating with him over something in a particular module before that I was left disgusted with his attitude.
Moreover, now that I am chasing someone close to him, he tries every way and mean to disturb me. I'm not saying he's bad, but you must be careful to not get the ""wrong impression"".

1293,1667,"(This confession is long, but if you want the summary: don't feel bad, 加油 for exams, think about life, read the bottom!)
I am a recent alumnus from FoS. I still remember NUS Confessions and I think NUSWhispers is awesome.
Admittedly, after reading social media, it's likely that one might not be very happy with myself. You might ask why. One could feel:
- envious because others have already got attached but one is left on the shelf.
- backward because others have A+ and A for their modules but one needs to be content with the B+.
- ill-prepared because others have already got life's journey worked out but not one.
But this is social media, friends. There may be trolls running around dissing you, or claiming some other friend is trying to square you up. There are friends of mine who probably posted confessions that turn out to be relationship wreckers more than actual confessions. Sometimes I don't even know if the anonymous CLB incidents were even legit --- I thought PGP was more secluded, or say... near the bus park.
I still remember, when NUS Confessions first started in 2012, it also had such elements. People ranting, confessing real and supposed acts of intimacy and well, frustration with modules. (History check: https://www.facebook.com/nusconfessions?fref=ts). It's a nice experiment with social anonymity: with anonymous postings, what do people make out of that? Apparently, pretty much everything under the sun. In all good fun, I believe it shows the nice side of NUS (with the exception of some trolls who jab a majority of posts). NUS students come together to diss trolls, call out rubbish behaviour confessed by some arrogant punk, celebrate the overcoming of the bell curve god. Sometimes, it shows the ugly side of us: dominating the walls, writing rubbish that no one benefits from reading, not even a good laugh. But these are far and few.
For people who feel pissed at what you may read, it's a good idea to stop comparing. Social media has always, and will be tinted. People always report the good stuff, hide away the bad stuff, and only on an anonymous platform may one see some of the not-so-nice stuff online. It's funny reading posts like #1653 (how to manipulate), #1648 (silly thoughts), #1639 (probably a shy jock), #1627 (sad but real advice), #1620 (self-apologetic), #1595 (untruth), #1583 (real feeling --- I was like this before), #1560 (trivial stuff making one smile), #1550 (advice from some probably damn old alumnus from SoC), #1531 (actually some debate over NUSSU, phew!), #1483 (desperado, I understand your pain), #1455 (blast to the past), #1449 (satirical), #1412 (serial replier), #1398 (nice guy explaining the grading), #1357 (awwww moment), #1348 (continue discussing about worth of a grad please!) and more (lazy to scroll). Darn, now I feel like I am testing the bot, which will tirelessly fish out all these confessions. Yay to computing.
If one takes a step back, actually we're a cool bunch of people. We joke about trying to overtake the next guy on the bell curve, but recognise we're still friends outside the exam hall. We whine, curse about the serial farting king, but certainly laugh it all off. For a university, this is pretty darn lively and warm culture.
Fast forward to me: currently I work at a bank (cannot say which one, otherwise my boss will tell me to do more work and not post confession!), and life IS stressful outside. Pay is sustenance but at times, one's sanity is called into question. Do we really want to work that long hour simply because we have a job to protect? Unfortunately we do. As a student, I could sometimes just say, heck, let's keep the work for tomorrow. Life can be crushing sometimes; people fight just for the next rung on the ladder, but the battles are much more brutal than those on the bell curve --- backstabbing is common. Consequences are aplenty: the careless folk can be easily sabotaged and manipulated. The workplace is harsh.
I miss NUS, even though some people say it's just a place to mug for 3/4/5 years and then bye. It's really short, come to think of it, considering that the average person now will have to work for 40 years odd.
Sigh, I feel so old now.
Ok, maybe the specific replies I have to some:
- To the employers who posted here, thank you for the time and effort. But I think the young should be given a chance to prove themselves. I think the typical Singaporean is demanding, but when called to the fore, will step up to do something good. NUSWhispers is an example: for a module, they go over and beyond.
- To the sexually depraved: go get a life. Free sex stories is it? Even if we read it, we don't really know if we should envy you or ermmm... think you're just trying to make us all jealous.
- To the CAP 2.0 folk: take heart. It is hard to get a job the traditional way, but there may be other ways to make it big in life. Do you have a skill outside academics? Hone it, and maybe it'll be your lifeline.
- To the chasing: all the best. It is hard, fraught with rejections, but hopefully you'll do well.
- To the chased: play a little hard to get, but don't drive your queue nuts!
- NUSWhispers: Thank you for posting this confession. It's probably the longest confession, but I hope it has been worth your time reading this.
(P.S. I wish I had better Chinese. It might be something not graded anymore, but bad Chinese really hurts chances at going to China.)
All the best for the final exams! It's quite silly to say may you be on the right side of the curve (since half will be left), but I should say, may all do well and prosper. ;)

1957,2765,"#2755 To add on (I'm not the OP of that message). The implication of evolutionary purpose would mean doing things that increase likelihood of passing on one's genes to the next generation. Consider the following scenario: Your parents are being trapped in a fire along with strangers. You save your parents first. Based on #2735's logic, we should save the strangers since they are more likely to pass on our genes than our parents (who have already passed on theirs). Generally, most of us save our parents. This doesn't show an evolutionary purpose. Using the evolutionary account doesn't explain fully the reasons behind an action, there is a need to factor in human relations. Otherwise, we would start saving strangers.

1962,2770,"This post is with reference to #2704, #2735 and #2678.
Some people are saying that Singapore is largely a conservative society, as evidenced by the Singapore law. But is Singapore still a largely conservative society? Do the current laws reflect what the majority of Singaporeans think?
I am straight, and most, if not all, of the people I know who are also straight are very open to the idea of homosexuality.
I am not an expert in the Singapore justice system, but just think about this question: who decides what laws to pass? Do Singaporeans vote on what laws to pass, or does the decision lie in the hands of a few ministers.
Take the recent liquor law as an example. The law was passed based on the majority of a focus group of 40+ people and a couple of hundred surveys agreeing to law being passed. Where did they get the sample from and who did they ask? They sure did not ask for my opinion and neither they ask the other 5 million Singaporeans, including you. How are the results representative of what he majority of Singaporeans think? Were the results rigged?
My point is: could it be that the truly conservative people are the ministers (who are most likely be from the older generation) who enacted the law?
And most Singaporeans are open to the idea of homosexuality, but this 'fact' is hidden behind the facade of the law that may not be representative of what the majority of Singaporeans truly feel?
I am not trying to say which is the truth, but would just like for us to be critical and not take what we are told at face value. I am sure those who are educated will know that what the government or news reports tell us may or may not be the truth.

1979,2792,"To #2765 er no, the evolutionary account states the opposite, that we are more likely to save our parents because they have OUR genes. You and your parents share genes, that is why (by evolutionary terms) you would save your parents. Its called kin selection/altruism. Your cells (or genes or whatever) do not in some sense ""detect"" that your parents have already passed on their genes and stop the desire to save them. And when genes get passed on, your parents do not ""lose"" genes, since copies are passed down. Who is to say that your parents would not pass on more genes after you?

Assuming our parents are 50 +/ 60+, how likely are they going to pass down the genes (apart from us)? Not very likely, comparing to saving a stranger who we may have a relation with and pass down OUR own genes. Saving our parents therefore takes MORE than evolutionary explanation, otherwise we should save other people instead.

1995,2816,"This will be my last reply to this series of evolutionary ""debate"" (getting a bit long here). To OP of #2807 I'm sorry but maybe asking the right professor would be more apt -- a biology professor?
Look up reciprocal altruism, or read Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene. Basically, genes that promote altruistic behavior, especially towards that of close ones (parents, friends) or people who helped you are gradually passed down across generations and are naturally selected. Its pretty obvious - helping someone who has helped you before is beneficial in establishing a helpful mutual relationship. Saving your parents is more beneficial than a stranger because well, they are your parents! They raise you up, they provide care and nurture. But saving a stranger does not guarantee that he/she will help you back, or what if the stranger is evil? Most of the time, saving your parents provides more survival benefits, to put it crudely. Through a long period of natural selection, people with genes that generally favored helping their parents will tend to fare better than those who help strangers (you can think of many examples on your own why this would be the case)
You mentioned ""saving a stranger who we may have a relation with and pass down our genes"". What are you talking about? Someone whom you have a relation with is NOT a stranger. ""pass down our genes""? So you mean you share more genes with a stranger than your parents?

2006,2831,"To add on to #2816: If you really want to look at it from an evolutionary standpoint (and not a moralistic POV), you would save your parents because your offspring with your mother (yes I know it is morally wrong but hypothetically) will on average have 50 [your own genes] + (0.5 x 50) [since 50% of your mother genes are also your genes] = 75% genetic similarity; compared to an offspring with a complete stranger that will harbour only 50% of your genes.
Also, to those who are invoking the theory of evolution by NATURAL SELECTION to argue for or against LGBTQ issues, please note: In order to use natural selection as an explanation, there has to be a unit of selection (in this case a gay gene). Since so many opponents of LGBT have claimed that homosexuality is not natural (read: not genetic), it does not make sense to have an evolutionary argument. If homosexuality is as they said acquired, it should not be passed on to the next generation because of epigenetic reprogramming. Whether LGBTQ should have equal rights is completely up to debate (by the way I'm gay); the point of this is to tell you guys: if you guys want to use evolution to back up your arguments use the proper terms. I (metaphorically) get cancer every time I read badly-substantiated arguments.
*ps There was a book to explain homosexuality from a evolutionary standpoint and I thought it was fantastic. Go read it if you can (since its summer vacation).

2016,2841,"#2831 when i mentioned parents, I think perhaps it was not sufficiently clear. I assumed that our parents (mother) would not be able to reproduce.
Your claim that having offspring with your mother will help improve the chances of passing down ones genes is not wrong. But firstly, apart from simply passing down OUR genes, we do have to consider the viability of it. Our mothers advanced age would mean 1) highly unlikely to conceive 2) health risks 3) later age= higher risk of genetic defects in babies. Same goes for mating between siblings. There is a better chance, but with the greater risk of genetic defects, the baby may not live to pass on their genes to the next generations.
Evolutionary is not just our genes, but the genes of the human species as a whole. Crossing-over provides genetic variation, which will help to reduce the impact if a bottleneck situation occurs. Mating with others helps prevents a homogenous pool of genes (i forgot the correct term) but the idea is, it increases our chances of survival. The 'less of our genes' being passed on is outweighed by the greater chance of survival by our offspring.
Just to clarify, I don't believe in the evolutionary account against gay marriage (I support LGBTQA rights)

2077,2909,"#2807 #2792 Whoever uses purely genetic arguments without considering the kind of environment the organisms are living in has missed the entire point of altruism.
For social animals, there are various benefits of acting altruistically. Most important of all is that the debt will likely be repaid. Minor benefits include showing off to potential mates.
In humans, not saving parents causes emotional distress, loss of productivity within the family, shaming by society, etc. etc. That said, I can easily imagine situations where the choice of saving parents or saving unrelated strangers could go either way. Because the benefits differ in different circumstances, as well as different people place different values on things.

3960,5557,"I received the rejection from CS3216. Entering my final year too so I will never get another chance to apply for CS3216.
I'm pissed, I'm really pissed. I read Prof Ben Leong's essay on the strict selection criteria of CS3216/CS3217 and he openly admitted the elitist nature of these classes. To be frank, Prof Ben's elitist premise of these classes may seems righteous and reasonable, is very flawed and similar to income inequality, further perpetuates the divide between good and not-so-good programmers.
Every student who wants to take these classes should be be given the opportunity. In terms of outcome, if they do badly, well they do badly and face the music. We preach about equality of educational opportunity in Singapore but when it comes to walking the walk, SoC is not doing it. We all pay equal school fees don't we? Why are we denied equal access to quality modules?
On the argument that other students may suffer and their protection, isn't this already happening with the standard modules that most SoC students take? In the working world and other mods, sometimes we get the wrong group mates and we have to live with it. If they are really as good as made out to be, they will get through it.
I venture to say the selection criteria of CS3216/CS3217 are the only undergraduate modules in SoC and possibly NUS that reeks of the thinking of a certain old political party. No surprise why we still don't have another Facebook and Google that has spawned from CS3216/CS3217 alumni despite trying.
For the elite few who managed to enter either of these modules in the past and the coming semester, I congratulate you on your great effort and fortune in impressing the selection committee. For mere mortals like me, I have to contend myself in taking more mainstream modules.

I'm pissed, I'm really pissed. I watched Facebook’s video on how to ace your coding interview and they openly admitted the elitist nature of these interviews. To be frank, Facebook’s elitist premise of these interviews may seems righteous and reasonable, is very flawed and similar to income inequality, further perpetuates the divide between good and not-so-good programmers.
Every software engineer who wants to join these tech companies should be be given the opportunity. In terms of outcome, if they do badly, well they do badly and face the music. We preach about equality of hiring opportunity but when it comes to walking the walk, Facebook is not doing it. We all pay equal internet fees don't we? Why are we denied equal access to quality companies?
On the argument that other software engineers may suffer and their protection, isn't this already happening in most companies? In the working world, sometimes we get the wrong colleagues and we have to live with it. If they are really as good as made out to be, they will get through it.

3981,5579,"#5557 Rejection sucks man...but this is how it happens in the real world. You have to face it. Let me give you a personal experience: I was rejected for NTU scholarship interview because I failed to convince the panel about my achievements. I got good grades in English for A levels but I was so nervous during the interview that I stammered and stuttered most of the time. I made a bad first impression and the panel thought I was not competent enough.
It is because I got rejected that I joined NUS. Had I got the scholarship there, I would have joined NTU. Don't know whether I'm better off or worse off but I am definitely enjoying my life here and would consider myself successful. So it's not true that all rejections spell doom for your life.
Instead of blaming the selection process, I introspected and tried to improve my interview skills. With practice, my communication and interview skills are much better than before. However sad you may feel when you get rejected, most of the time there is no denying the bitter truth that you were not good enough. You can't change the unfair world, but you CAN change yourself.
Think harder. Why did the CS3216 committee reject you? Is it because they want a better coder than you? If so, you should utilise this time and sharpen your coding skills. When you apply for a job, the employers will pay more attention to your coding skills rather than scanning your transcript to look for 'CS3216'. Giant tech companies like Google and Facebook have multiple interview rounds to assess your technical and soft skills. Prepare yourself for these.
Paying same fees doesn't give us the right to take the same modules. All Singaporeans pay taxes, why doesn't everyone get the high-paying coveted government jobs. The world isn't fair to everyone, it is competitive. CAP, grades, intelligence, competence aren't everything in life, but they are not totally unimportant. When it comes to limited resources, only the best are chosen. Survival of the fittest.

To those who took CS3216/CS3217 before and commented, please take your elite faces and go back to your ivory towers please. Like the post in #5466, it is easy for you to say, ""just do better, try again, there are alternative routes, you don't need CS3216/CS3217"" when you have the opportunity and I don't. You are nobody to judge that I might not be able to handle the workload and be a tremendous drag on my potential teammates when I did not have a chance in the first place. Why have the double standard of pretending to be like the workforce and turn around and say those inside have to be protected? If one does not need CS3216/CS3217, why did you not walk the talk and not apply in the first place?
It's proof enough that Colin admitted that 99% of apps died after CS3216. This means most of the stuff you guys did weren't good enough to be commercially viable. So much for being the elite. Most of the more visible stuff from Computing students like NUSMods, NUSWhispers and the SoC Print app did not originate from CS3216/CS3217 in the first place.

4021,5641,"Hi OP of #5621,
Beng here. I'd usually be reluctant to add to this, but since Prof Ben Leong mentioned me, here’s some context. Perhaps you, or others, might find it encouraging.
At one point, my CAP was 1.13, and I've experienced plenty of rejection and missed opportunities. Because of my dismal grades, I could only take the more “mainstream” CS3201/2 software engineering modules. But in my spare time, I kept building my own side projects, exploring new stuff and learning.
I've never managed to get a summer internship, so one of the ways I sought to improve during summers instead was to release and iterate on products myself, e.g. NUSMods. That’s the same kind of thing you would do in CS3216/7. (I did get into CS3216, but only in my final year.)
While CS3216 certainly does provide a combination of guidance, teammates and an environment so challenging that it practically forces you to learn faster than you would probably want to duplicate on your own unless you were massively masochistic, what's one semester vs. a lifetime of learning? [=

4025,5643,"#5557 Long post guys, hang on.
The part about protecting you from the mod is not bullshitting.
3217 is a killer mod and not for the weak.
I got rejected for 3217 at first because my CAP was lower than the bar, but I appealed to the professor with my 2103 grades. There was an unexpected vacancy, so I got in.
We were doing assignments right from the first week and picking up Swift on the go. Assignments due every 1 or 2 weeks. The workload was crazy.
I was struggling really hard. I spent most of my time on 3217. I only took 4 mods that sem but my CAP went down.
So yeah there's a reason why they let the 'elites' in - because they can handle this killer mod and their normal mods together.
Honestly I don't regret doing 3217, but it's not like this shiny gateway to heaven that instantly makes you better- it's a hell that you have to work through and come out the better for, and YMMV depending on how much effort you put into it.
Also if you're rejected, it's not the end of the world. (Yes, coming from someone who got in eventually, you probably don't believe me.) Just find alternatives!
Whatever I learned in 3217 could be learned elsewhere. You just need to make the effort to learn. You don't need to take the module to learn what is taught there!
Regarding alternatives to learning what is taught in 3217, watching WWDC might be a good start or picking up an online course in iOS development.
If you want the experience of working on a big project, why not try contributing to TEAMMATES? Or find an internship?
If there's a will, there's a way. I'm sure the professors won't mind recommending other sources of learning too. :)

4027,5647,"#5621 As a social scientist and humanities researcher, I don't think this is a simple issue about whether a student ranting about unfairness of the CS3216/CS3217's selection criteria. I am not happy with most of the responses to OP's confession as they simply amplify the opinions (doxa) of the political structures that we are in.
It is easy to give comments that people agree on and receive likes from them. Scientific progress doesn't depend on people agreeing on things but on finding things that people disagree on. Personally, I learn the most by addressing both disagreements and agreements (in a Hegelian sense). It seems that the dialectic process is missing in many technical faculties.
Have we consider that the possibility of student bringing new qualities to CS3216/CS3217 which is not identified in the present discourse? We often look for students with good developing skills, designers to be in-charge of UI/UX, marketer with Business experience etc. All these are technical skills (the know-how). What else is missing?
For example, Stanford University has a class where Computer Science students work together with students from Humanities / Social sciences to do inter-disciplinary projects. Src: http://news.stanford.edu/news/2015/january/humanities-cs-class-010515.html To quote: ""And they agreed that learning to communicate across disciplines is the course's greatest challenge as well as its major payoff. ""I want the students to learn to talk to each other,"" Thrun remarked, ""and reach levels of achievement that individual disciplines alone never could achieve.""""
Often we relegate the task of generating meaning to the designers or the marketer. But the ones that are good at the ""know-what"" comes from people who like to ask big questions. They are not necessarily the designers / marketers. These people often have degrees which the society consider to be useless ""technically"". They are destined to work for Starbucks or McDonald's. Imagine what we can do if we expand our criteria.
Software engineers learned about the important principle of refactoring. There are often better ways of improving our current design even if things are functioning nicely. So why aren't we taking this principle and apply it to the criteria of CS3216/CS3217 or any parts of our life.
So in software engineering jargon: REFACTOR!!! REFACTOR!!! REFACTOR!!!
In ordinary language: IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE!!! IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE!!! IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE!!!
The comments from some of the students are alerting. I urge everyone to think harder in whatever position they are in. The education system wants to pretend that it is meritocratic i.e. the smartest and the brightest will get to the top. What if you are too intelligent enough to see the flaws in the system and try to change it? Will you be stopped? Especially when most people are comfortable with the conditions that they are used to :)
The lesson is that currently if you are too intelligent to point out the flaws in the system, you are not allowed by the authorities to change it. Power, as Foucault pointed out, is not residing in any individuals but in the social structures. In NUS, the students no longer hold any power over what the schools decide. NUS student union and NUS political association are facades. The university bureaucrats do things behind our back. Just like how they change the minimum workload policies recently.

4034,5656,"In light of all the talk about CS3216/7 in #5557 & #5621, I feel like I need to get the word out about the other non-mainstream third year project modules.
CS3281/2 and CS3283/4 are both really good and underrated alternatives that require students to work independently and create a complex, large-scale app (usually from scratch). Most projects are for a real world client with real end users, which means your code will impact peoples' lives!
I had the privilege to conduct end-user testing of my project on behalf of my client and I can honestly say that seeing their eyes light up and hearing their positive feedback is the most gratifying thing in the world. It reinforced my passion for software engineering and encouraged me to put in even more effort for the rest of the project.
As with 3216/7, the 81/2 & 83/4 modules also take a less structured approach and most of the knowledge gained is self-learned, along with regular peer reviews to facilitate knowledge transfer between teams.
Teams are formed by students and you apply as a team for your preferred project. So in that sense, you are responsible for your own choices, whether you have struggling team members pulling you down or a hard working cohesive team lifting you up, is entirely on you.
This also means that not every project made is fantastic and not all groups are strong, but the onus is on you to make your project the best that it can be. (This is less of a problem for 81/2 because of the vnp/tp majority requirement, but in 83/4, there is broad range of students with varying abilities.)
Imo (and this is purely my opinion), CS3216/7 is a great 'networking' module to allow the 'elite' students to work together and get to know each other, but in order to achieve this, it has to break up the modules into multiple short intensive projects. While this allows for mingling, it sacrifices the opportunity for large scale software development during these short sprints.
To me, CS3216/7 is like trying to hit gold timing for 2.4km 3 times consecutively without breaks; it is intense and great training if you come out of it alive. But CS3281/2 & 3/4 is like running one single 42km marathon spanning 1 and 2 semesters respectively; it is not about short bursts of coding power, but pacing yourself throughout an entire year's worth of iterations to deliver a polished product without letting fatigue get in the way.
In short, the various 3rd year project modules target students with different goals and preferences (not just different abilities!); read up about ALL of them (CS3201/2, CP3208/9, CS3281/2, CS3283/4 & CS3216/7) and pick the one that you think is more suitable for you.
p/s: Look beyond the module name and descriptions because 'Thematic Systems' and 'Media Tech' are not very meaningful and do not do these modules justice.

I think we've all seen a pretty good example of the xenophobia us foreigners are subjected to; the comments and responses on this page prove so. I don't face racism everyday, but when I do, it hurts.
I'm a scholarship holder too. Go ahead, sue me, but my parents don't have enough money to finance an education abroad. If you all didn't know yet, the tuition fee for international students is DOUBLE that of Singaporeans. So yes, if you're coming from a poor family, it gets quite difficult.
Whatever I've done and whatever I've achieved is due to my own hard work. We're not having an easy time in university, we're working hard too, to get the grades we deserve.
Plus, you're forgetting the 3-6 year bond that comes attached with any govt. scholarship. We don't have the freedom to do what we want to do later. Imagine wanting to go for higher studies later in a university you're getting a scholarship to, but having to pass up the offer because MOE rejected bond deferment.

As a student contemplating graduate studies abroad, I don't really agree with the hostility we're directing towards international students, particularly when I don't want to be be on the receiving end of that elsewhere. Put yourself in their shoes - Would you like to be seen as a parasite just because you decided to learn elsewhere and broaden your horizons? And what if you have difficulty securing the means to study overseas without a scholarship? Wouldn't you want to look for scholarships offered by foreign universities (even governments)? Are we so xenophobic now that we hate everyone else in the world just because they're not 'one of us'? Definitely, definitely don't agree with that. Xenophobia is on the rise all across the world again, and that's a crying shame. Just look at the policies that are slamming down in the UK now, much less the increasing xenophobia in Australia, Europe, and the US. We should be breaking down borders these days, not building it up.
Essentially, it's just a simple matter of reciprocity, I feel. If you want to be treated with respect when overseas, why wouldn't you treat people with respect while they're here? Regardless of what they are like (and admittedly, some are less than pleasant--I'm sure we can all call to mind the relevant incidents, as blown out of proportion as some of them might be--, but that can also be said of our overseas students.), they're still people, and deserve to be treated as such. I for one am glad that they're here and raising the profile of NUS. Not only do they help boost us up the rankings (research alone does not make us a world-leading university), but they give us so many new experiences and worldviews while they're here too. You can't quantify things like that. I am reluctant to even call them 'benefits' because that risks a sort of objectification.
Even if you are willing to be treated appallingly in another country for the sake of your degree and that it isn't a big deal to you, I'm still not convinced by arguments that the 'their country their rules' argument is at all well-grounded. We're living in the 21st century, with all the benefits that provides. Primarily, it's a time when we can travel and still keep in contact with our loved ones, a time when heading out to search for work isn't the complete and utter uprooting of our lives as we know it. We can go anywhere and it's not a big deal for us anymore. Some of us will want to study elsewhere for a while. Why should that be penalised? So if the boundaries are more permeable than they've ever been, why should we employ such a knee-jerk and static response of 'foreignness' to it? Sure, local taxpayers put money into the area and should enjoy more privileges that foreigners don't because of it, but it's not like they don't bring money in and spend it here while they're here. We shouldn't be bitter or in any way unhappy about them receiving scholarships and/or the tuition grant, because they bring so much with them, and we have as many opportunities as they do to go elsewhere too. Ultimately, I hope that we've reached the stage where we can be a bit more moderate and welcoming in our response towards foreign students. As the OP pointed out, blaming them for government policy isn't exactly cool, and in the first place, maybe it isn't that bad a policy at all.

I recently returned from a long overseas exchange and realized why that is a problem for many Singaporeans. Foreigners grow up in the different environment as to the locals. Thus, when you first arrived in the country, even if you speak English fluently, you do not speak Singlish. That's not the main point. More importantly, you speak on a different frequency to the locals. They do not find the jokes you think it's funny; you do not like the food they enjoy very much. You might want to go out and explore the country while they prefer to stay home and watch tv.

I'll bite. I accept that none of us can control the country we're born in. And without anything more, it would be at best slightly absurd and at worst incredibly unfair to expect excessive benefits simply because your parents had sex at spot A while a 'foreigner's' parents had sex at spot B.
However, Singaporean males do something called National Service. 50% of us make a contribution to the place we were born that I daresay is not matched by any citizens in any other developed country. This entitles (yes, entitles) us to demand some benefit in return. Duty is well and good, but that alone does not bind me to something as arbitrary as where I was born. I should be at least given a fair chance at making a decent living. Some people, hating the concept of compulsory conscription, might demand more. They would not be unjustified in doing so. In particular, it would be nice if people who did not do NS were not put on a pedestal and be given preferential treatment over people who gave 2 of the best years of their lives to the country. (To be intellectually coherent, this argument extends to a lesser extent to Singaporean females as well, but not many people are willing to accept that implication, so I will leave it at that.) The argument crumbles if there exist no foreign scholars with worse grades than a similar Singaporean with a comparable family background, but evidently that is not the case.
TLDR: Xenophobia is stupid, without anything more backing it up. But in the unique case of Singapore, we do in fact have something that justifies a Singaporeans first policy.
I suppose this may be seen as tasteless and unpopular, but I think it is a position with verifiable merit. I took care to inject nuance and lay out assumptions, and welcome criticism.

I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any foreign scholars with grades worse than a Singaporean but still under a scholarship funded by our govt. All foreign scholars I've met all had straight As. So your argument does crumble.
I've met foreign scholars who are also under scholarships from their own foreign govt or from private companies/institutes. But they these 2 entities are not within our control. So don't assume that every foreign scholar is funded by Singaporean tax money.
But I will concede that scholarship application processes are terribly flawed. Scholarships for BOTH local and foreign students are based on A-level grades or whatever pre-U qualifications you have. We end up with a peculiar situation whereby 4.5 GPA students who did badly in A-levels do not have scholarship while 3.5 GPA students who did well in A-levels have scholarships.
IMO this is a very unfair situation. Scholarships should be reassessed on a yearly basis. Should a non-scholar overtake a scholar during the years in university, then that non-scholar should be awarded the scholarship instead.

8897,13028,"I agree with #13008, although for a different reason. The issue isn't really about sex, it's about what each of you want in the relationship. We all want different things, what you want may be different from what your partner wants. But more importantly, what you want now may conflict with what you want in the longer-term. For instance, wanting sexual pleasure now may come in the way of wanting a sustainable long-term meaningful relationship. May.
So it's about the relative importance you place on your current wants vs future wants vs partner. If you place so much importance on your current wants and your partner compromises, then all's good. But if your partner doesn't, then you have to weigh how important your wants are vs how important your partner is to you. If your current wants are so important that you would seek other means to fulfill them, then perhaps you guys are not suited for each other after all. Or put another way, since your partner views her wants as far more important than yours, then maybe you guys aren't suitable for each other.
Not saying either of you is ""wrong"" or anything, just saying that we all have to make decisions about what we feel is most important. If we can't find a compromise between conflicting desires or work things out, then maybe it's time to find someone else who has the same wants as you or is willing to compromise.

8904,13042,"To #12968: Yes, it’s definitely a lot more common than you think, and it’s fine to not know whether you’re compatible in bed before marriage. I don't know about you, but to me that’s not the most important thing to look for in a life partner. So think about what’s most important to you. You’ve been with this girl for over a year; how’s your compatibility like in terms of character, values, outlook on life, etc? Are you saying that if she was perfect for you in all these areas but wasn’t perfect in the sex department, or if she looked hideous naked (I would think most people look similar and just fine naked), you’d actually leave her?
Like others have mentioned, it’s impossible for most couples to be 100% sexually compatible from the get go. Have a read of accounts of people having sex for the first time after marriage (there are plenty on the net, just google) - couples who have been abstinent all the way until marriage are not going to be sex gods the first few times. I’m sure exceptions are out there, but we’re talking the majority. Most of the time it starts out awkward. It then gets better over time as you communicate and slowly “learn” how to have sex with each other. It sounds silly, but it’s really something most couples work through in a mutually loving and caring relationship. And it doesn’t have to start off as BAD sex; it can still be fun, because you’re exploring it for the first time with the person you love. It’s definitely still exciting and intimate. My point is - it’s a learning process, and that’s what relationships are about in the first place. You learn and adapt to each other’s preferences and needs in bed, just as you learn and adapt to all of each other’s non-sexual preferences and needs in life.
I say good on you for respecting your girlfriend’s choice to not have sex before marriage. Don’t be one of those guys who force their girls into doing it for their own gain - trust me, that’s not love. Love is respect, trust and communication. Definitely talk to your girlfriend, but understand that you’re not doing it to pressurise her into changing her mind if she’s firm in her values and beliefs. Talk to her because she’s your closest confidante, and because you’d like her to understand the struggles you’re going through, so that she can support you through it. Please seek proper help if you need to, or post anonymously on forums (and I mean legit forums dedicated to sexual health and things like that. NUSWhispers may not be the best place because some of the people here have given downright ridiculous advice) for advice on how to deal with sexual urges in an abstinent relationship, google for ideas, etc etc. There are more likeminded people out there than you think. It’s hard, but it can be done, and I speak from experience.
If you’re thinking about hooking up with girls or engaging “professional services” from the bad advice that someone else has posted, please for the love of god, DON’T. I cannot emphasise this enough. I don’t want to belittle your feelings for your girlfriend, but if you’re considering sleeping with other girls to satisfy your own needs and you’re actually prioritising that above the relationship with your girlfriend that has been built on trust and respect so far, then maybe you don’t love her enough. Please REALLY think about it long and hard. Yes, she may never find out. But what if she does? You’re about to destroy the girl you love with your own bare hands in the most brutal way ever. You’re about to take the trust that she’s given so wholly to you and trample all over it, because you selfishly love your own needs more than the relationship that you’ve been working so hard to protect over the past one year. Even if she never finds out, are you ready to live with the guilt for the rest of your life? Because this is cheating, period. You may think it won’t hurt her if you go behind her back and if she never finds out. But no, that does not make it any less wrong, hurtful or unethical. Your relationship (and subsequent marriage) would be one built on lies and deceit, not love and trust. Believe me OP, you’re better than that. Guard your relationship with your life. Don’t take chances, don’t take risks, and don’t underestimate your ability to hurt her as well as your relationship. One wrong step is enough to set off a lifetime of regrets. In short: If you love her, don’t do it. If you do it, leave her because she deserves better.
Lastly, it’s not embarrassing to be a virgin. Like someone else rightly said, it’s only as embarrassing as you choose it to be. And you most certainly do not need to keep your friends updated about your sex life. If you’re really embarrassed about being a virgin (I don’t know how your friends are like, but I understand that some less mature minds may deem it uncool/whatever), no one else has to know about it other than your girlfriend and yourself. You don’t need to confess to anyone about something so private and personal. Yes some guys brag about their sexual escapades, but you don’t have to be that kind of guy. I personally feel that those who don’t actually command a lot more respect.
I wish you the best of luck, OP. I’m sure she’s an amazing girl and I’m sure you love her. I understand that this is something very hard to deal with, but trust me, there are many success stories of abstinent relationships out there. Again, I speak from experience. I sincerely hope you make the right decision for yourself. Treasure your relationship, fight hard to protect it. Remember that she loves you and trusts you. Don’t, don’t, don’t break her heart.

8957,13106,"To #12968:
I am a girl, and because of an ex-boyfriend who kept pressurising me to have sex (but was unsuccessful; this constant pressurising was the reason why I called it off), I viewed my virginity lightly then, and even considered just giving it to him when I was still with him. His constant pressurising made it seem as though it was nothing much (which I believe that's the opinion of many - we all have the right to our own opinions).
It was only when I met my current boyfriend (after breaking up with my ex) that I was so relieved I kept my virginity, and I now see the value of it. I guess I can call myself a convert on this issue. A few days ago I literally looked down there (self sex ed lesson I guess - sorry if it's TMI), and I realised that I have never seen it properly before. It dawned on me how precious and private these parts are, and many of us (virginity believers or not) may not see the beauty of it. I feel that we should have more self-love, we're beautiful creatures. Treat yourself with care.
My current boyfriend is very conservative, and does not take kissing lightly as well, so I guess that also influenced me. I'm actually less conservative than him and has initiated things that he wasn't ready for yet. (Maybe my boyfriend is a special case)
But what my past relationship and my current relationship have taught me was that there's a reason why you should keep your virginity until marriage (but of course you really have to love the person when you decide to marry him/her, else, the marriage will probably fail). It is mainly because sex is an act of love, an act of the deepest connection you could ever have with someone, and you really want to do it with someone you love very much, because you will remember it forever.
While I have not lost my virginity yet, I lost my first kiss to my ex (and a couple of other acts), and from time to time I get reminded of it, and I regret it. In fact, sometimes I even feel disgust (obviously it didn't end well - I'm not speaking for those whose past relationships ended well) that it happened. I'm sure I will remember it forever, and regret it forever. My current boyfriend is an absolutely great guy, and I wished I never had these bad memories from my past relationship, and have saved it for him instead. Of course I can't undo these things I've done. Now I'm certainly saving my virginity for him on our wedding night (or if anything happens which I hope not, the next person I will love).
So, you will certainly remember your virgin experience as well. So are you sure you want to give this up to someone you may not be together forever/love forever? (not saying that marriage lasts forever either - that's why you really need to marry someone that you really love and can foresee yourselves building a life together) You are going to remember your first time forever (feel free to disagree with me on this). And what if... Just what if, it doesn't work out between you guys? You will bring this memory with you forever, and you just can't erase it, and this regret may follow you for a long time to come. If you can't bear this thought, don't create this memory.
And if after it falls apart you meet someone fabulous and someone you love even more than your previous, then now what? Whenever you both engage in sexual acts, you will always be reminded of your first time with someone else. At that point in time, would you have wished you have saved it for this perfect person instead? There's no ""start over"" then.
I have to stress that I'm not coming from a religious angle (sorry if the part on beautiful creatures seems so), and that I am a free-thinker. I'm just highlighting how because we always keep those parts private, we may not actively see the beauty of it, and how we should really let only someone we love very deeply handle it. We all have private parts, something that belongs only to ourselves - we're equal like that, I guess. Something we can truly call ""our own"". It should be something personal, something vulnerable, something you reveal to someone you really trust. This is something I really disliked about my ex - the fact that he's always so open to giving something so private to him to others and that he even influenced me to think like him.
I don't see how virginity should not be held onto even when someone is 24. Love yourself enough to acknowledge that your current relationship, no matter how great it is, may not be your last, and it is a risk to create a permanent memory of something that may be temporary. Choose wisely.
Believe me, I have seen virginity lightly before and I didn't realise how precious it could be. And now I do. To have a self sex-ed lesson only at 20 is a tad late, and I can already imagine how inexperienced I can be on my wedding night and just how much I really don't know about sex, but hey, I think it will be a sweet (albeit awkward) memory to learn along with your partner - it's going to be sweet if you guys really love each other.
PS. I'm sorry if this post has offended anyone (virginity believers or not/religious or not) - I certainly do not mean to, and I'm just sharing my thoughts and my own experience. Feel free to disagree, it's a free world.

This isn't really a response to the post, but I identify with OP fully.

He treats me as if I'm really precious to him and he makes me feel very comfortable around him.
However, in my past relationship, my boyfriend used to force me to do things... I am a bit embarrassed to say this but let's just say that I gave him my body and everything but not my virginity. I'm so glad I didn't give him my virginity, but now I feel immense regret that I gave him all that.. I don't dare to tell my current bf about my past because it'll definitely change his impression of me. I want to keep it in too but sometimes I feel so much pain and anger with myself and I feel guilty for keeping secrets from my current bf. It's easy for people to say 'if he truly loves you, he'll accept you' but this is probably a big issue to him, as it is to me :( should I remain quiet about it?

9020,13180,"Since we're on the sex before marriage issue, allow me to play devil's advocate and offer my extreme opinion:
I think the idea of saving your virginity until marriage is misguided. In fact, I'll even go as far as to say that it is unhealthy.
Mainly I feel that a girl should not be valued based on her virginity or her sex life. You never see guys worrying about saving their virginity until marriage (well actually you do, but much less), so why must girls be restricted to the same standards? This just perpetuates gender stereotypes in society and contributes to inequality.
To take things further, think about girls who have suffered sexual assault or rape. Does that mean they are of any less worth? I hope not. But such a societal attitude can only worsen the trauma experienced by these girls. Now, I am not saying that a change in opinion will make it any less painful for these victims, but it will certainly help in the recovery process to understand that there are things in life that matter more than virginity or sex.
Now. Let's take a look at your view. The main argument in the other side of the debate is that virginity is something you should save for the person you love/marry (hopefully the same person). And if not, you will be haunted by all the times you did ""it"" with other people..
Frankly.. it's just a circular argument, isn't it?
""Virginity is impt cos if u lose it u will regret it cos virginity is impt.""
I know I've probably trampled on the staunch beliefs and values of many out there. But think about it: where did these beliefs about premarital sex come from? Aren't these just social constructs passed down from generation to generation?

Well said. Then again, some girls love being 清高 by saying that they have saved it blablabla. Like as if it was such a big deal.
Its already the 20th century, who cares whether you saved it or not. People lead different lives so stop putting yourself at a high pedestal by saying ""oh im so ashamed but phew i didnt lose it, but i did other things"".
IMO, virginity is not only just about the hymen. If a girl has done any kind of sex e.g oral, heavy petting etc, you are already not a virgin.
Saving your hymen does not mean anything. At the same time, losing your hymen does not mean anything bad either. It just means that they have loved and lost, or that they love their current partner and want to take it to the next stage.
Sure, you should not pressure a girl to give you her first time, but if it happens, it will happen. Virginity is just a social construct to prevent people from overpopulating. Before such constructs, people married at age 15/16.
Nuff said.

Well the thing is, how physically closer can you be with someone other than sex? How more ""open"" emotionally and physically can you be?
Personally, I keep it because I believe that I want to share it only with one person whom I love and who loves me so much that we have promised to commit to each other through thick and thin to the end ( i'm one of those who do not believe in divorce). Why would I share a special moment with someone who does not reach that level of closeness? I think that kind of love that requires commitment deserves to be celebrated. Our culture often describes love as merely a feeling or emotion. I think love is more than that.
Also, even if the notion that ""sex/ vitginity is valuable"" is a social construct, so what? what's wrong with that?( I do not think it is, though, I think it is there for a reason) Why can't I keep some part of me special and reserved? A VIP room is special because people set aside a special area for special people, and only certain people can come in. It makes it special. Why can't we reserve sex for a special person who deserve it? Sure we can save other moments, i guess, though as of now i can't think of anything better.
Based on experience, I regretted that I kissed my ex. I shared a moment with someone that I barely talk to now. I do not regret it to the point that I see myself as not pure anymore etc etc or that it affects my self-esteem etc. Just that I wished I did not easily share that intimate moment with someone in the heat of the moment. Probably because I want to see it as more than just physical pleasure and I think it is an expression of love (and I think love requires commitment)
On the topic of rape, I agree that a raped woman is not of less value than a virgin. I know the pain and shame is extremely hard to bear with, but demeaning sex/ virginity is not the answer. Like, even children who do not even understand what sex means are traumatised by sexual abuse. Their tendency is to avoid the rapist. They sure do not like it. It is natural to feel sad/traumatised when you are sexually abused.
Just like when people are slashed, they bleed, they feel pain.
Would we say that ""it's okay,the cut will heal anyway "" and do nothing?
No, we should recognise that it is a painful experience and try as much as we can to heal them, though we cant do it completely. There will still be unsightly scars that make them want to hide at home
People who look down on the victims are like those who mock the slash victim because of the physical scars.
It is unsightly, maybe. We might have to admit that rape victims might have emotional scars that affects them.
Instead of dismissing their pain, we should show compassion, understanding and empathy. Each of us are broken in some ways anyway.

Thanks for sharing.
As much I would like to believe in true love.. it's really rare for people to find the one person that they love and for both of them to stick with each other for the rest of their lives.
Listen, you shouldn't regret that you kissed your ex. It doesn't make you any less of a woman (i assume) or a person. That is actually what I was trying to say.
I don't claim to understand love fully, but surely heat-of-the-moment, passionate love is also a form of true love. Furthermore, nobody loves perfectly from the beginning. It's only through failed experiences that you learn to love your final partner properly.
I certainly can't change how you personally feel about sex or intimacy. However, my point is that as a whole, this social construct that virginity is important is detrimental to how society values girls and how girls value themselves. And, like I said, it's really just a circular argument. A needlessly demeaning circular argument.

I am kinda in the same situation like you but in my case our roles switched. It's my boyfriend that went through the similar past that you shared about. However, sadly, his is worse. He gave his virginity to his ex too. He didn't want to tell me but, let's just cut it short, I found out about it. It was very very very, hurtful when I realised everything that he'd told me was a lie. To be fair, it was his past and I had no right to know if he didn't want to tell. However, now that I know about it already, the thoughts of him f**king his ex always appear out of no where and it's just freakin annoying. I honestly do not know when will all these thoughts stop coming to me. Maybe my whole life?
My suggestion is, if your bf asks, you shall not lie. But if he doesn't mention it at all, maybe he doesn't want to know it. In that case just let it go. But if you are planning to go far with him, I don't think there should be any secrets between a couple. So, just tell him. Though it will hurt like hell. But if he does truly loves you, he will stay. Just like how I'm still together with my bf after 2.5 years because I love him though his past won't stop haunting me.

9132,13345,"I'm an NUS undergrad and I will be arranging for an abortion in a few weeks time - alone. My family can never know about it (they don't even know I'm sexually active and are very conservative) and neither can any of my friends, and my boyfriend, though supportive, is going to be overseas for months for official reasons that he cannot cancel. We have been using condoms 99% of the time, and yes...it just had to happen, in spite of the odds. It frustrates me to no end because we tried so hard to be responsible and all it took was one gone awry.
I am so, so scared of going for the procedure alone. I will have no ride home and no one to accompany me throughout. Will I be safe? I know there are risks and pain involved, or even drowsiness post-abortion, what with the painkillers and sedation. I'm at a loss. I'm sure there are girls out there in NUS who've had an abortion before, maybe you could anonymously share your experience with me.
Note:
I do not want any judgmental pro-life comments now about ""just keep the baby/you're a murderer"" etc. I am in no position, physically, mentally, financially at this point in my life, to raise a child nor even to carry it to term (hobbling around NUS, no less - and even you moralistic pro-lifers would judge and shame); and besides, I do not believe that life starts at conception.
The sole point of this post is to reach out to people who've had similar experiences and to seek some company and personal stories and real advice. This is not, I repeat NOT, the post to start an abortion debate or a self-righteous provocation. Do that elsewhere instead - there are plenty of forums dedicated to this. In light of my intent and situation, please be considerate to everything - physical and emotional - that people like me had to go through.

Hi there. You say you're going for an abortion ""in a few weeks""? Please don't. Please get it done a.s.a.p. Change gynae if you have to. I recommend Dr Denas Chandra at Parkway East Hospital. I hope you have enough money for the procesure. Early abortions will set you back about $1k, but depends on procedure too. May be cheaper if you're still in early stages where the pills suffice. Cab home. Spend that extra $10. You'll be too weak to take public tpt. Keep your receipts. Rest well. Most importantly, do not feel. Put your emotions aside. Being strong means sticking to your logical side and braving the wind.
I suggest you also get some form of birth control.
Why should you listen to me? Because I was in your situation before. Don't try anything stupid. Don't smoke/drink/drugs. Just nurse yourself back to health. Don't fuck. Pray if it makes you feel better.
Excuse me for breaking the reality to you. Abortions are easy if you let go of the romanticizEd visionof the process being where your boyfriend pays and accompanies you etc. Your biggest barrier is the cops in your head and society telling you its wrong etc. also, possibly the hardest part is the financial price. Be prepared. Be strong. All the best.

I'd like to thank every commenter and subsequent OPs who wished me well and/or offered their help, know that I read every one of them and am greatly surprised and grateful for the support. However, as of now, I'm still leaning towards keeping my anonymity and am also just steeling myself mentally to go through it on my own, the way I know many young women have as well.
However, to the OP of #13395 - thank you so much for sharing your personal experience. May I know the breakdown of the timeframe it took you, from first screening appt, to the mandatory counselling, to the eventual abortion itself? Parkway, the one you went to, is a private hospital, so it's definitely much faster than the public route I'm likely to go through.
I'm in a dilemma, because the poly + referral to a public hospital + appt for counselling + finally the appt for the abortion itself is known to take up to a whopping 4 weeks; which is why I mentioned ""weeks"". However, this route will ""only"" cost about $500-800. However, I would absolutely hate to go through pregnancy and the nausea for another month more, and it will be increasingly difficult to hide the nausea from my family, of all things. A more advanced pregnancy will also complicate the procedure further and also drive the price up even higher. Going to a private clinic would swiftly settle everything within a few days, but it will cost up to an insane $1.5-8k, which I can barely afford. I'm so stressed out.

9192,13422,"Hi, I'm a different OP from previously. In reference to post #13345, I have experience in which you are lacking in.
So, I went to the polyclinic, visited the GP. told him i was pregnant, and told him I wanted to get a TOP. You have to tell him this, straight up. Then the poly set up an appt at KKH a week later. Went to the first appointment, went for the ultrasound. Then, turns out the fetus died at 7 weeks. That was tough. As you are waiting to see the doctor at the end to sign some papers and confirm the date of surgery, they will take you in for some counselling. 2 stops. One to discuss an alternate method, they will try to talk you out of it. The second, to discuss contraceptive methods. Then you see the doctor. The day surgery was a week later.
I remember the entire period being one of the most demanding periods I had ever gone through. Other than that, it was right smack during finals but I had no choice. That was tough. The nausea didn't stop until the day of the surgery.
Try to stay away from home. Minimise physical contact with your family, at least until everything is over. They will sense that something is wrong. However for me, I went through the entire thing without my family suspecting a single thing.
I paid $150 through medisave. The other $600 my bf of that time helped to offset the cost. Even then, it caused a lot of emotional strain between us. We are no longer together.
I wish you all the best, truly. I have been where you are. There will be countless nights leading up to the surgery where you feel stuck and it feels like shit but trust me, it gets better. Find people you can trust to confide in. If you can't, you have me. Most importantly, know that this is what you have to do and trust that you will get through this. God bless.

9279,13546,"This whole abortion saga has been getting so heated I just wanted to share my humble opinions on the issue, and hopefully be the voice of reason, as much as we are all imperfect creatures with our own biased views based on religion, family, or environmental factors.
(long post ahead, you have been warned)
1. Keep your emotions to yourself.
Majority of the posts are loaded with strong emotions, written in an antagonistic tone which makes it difficult for rational people to take you seriously. Reason and emotion are opposites, and your tone by itself makes it apparent which side you are on. You wouldn't bet a life changing decision on emotions, so why dispense life changing advice in this way?
2. Pre-marital sex is only a sin to people who believe it is.
I.e. religious people, or others who hold the same values. Aside from that, it is pleasurable, and an integral part of married life. I don't see any fault in anyone wanting to ""test-drive"" their partner's performance in bed. Those who disapprove should not attempt to stop anyone from sampling sex life with their potential partners in future.
The only things that would truly be difficult to approve of with regard to sex is promiscuity, because of the health hazards of sexually transmitted diseases, and infidelity, which is self explanatory.
3. Abortion is not the same as murder, or anything to the same degree.
Yes, it is a fact that life exists at the moment of conception, similar to the life that already existed before conception, in the form of a sperm (which is produced and resorbed in the millions daily) and an egg (which is lost in every menstrual cycle). Those are the same forms of life as the bacteria that give you an infection when you get a cut, or the bad sore throats that the GP gives you antibiotics for. Just a single cell/group of cells. But that doesn't stop you from washing your hands or rinsing your mouth with Listerine (kill the germs, feel the fresh!), and we all know you'll get your boyfriends and fathers to smash the next cockroach that crawls into your room, while you squash every ant in close proximity and rain insecticide down on innocent moths and spiders that venture into your room.
The key issue here is consciousness. Does the tiny ball of cells know it is alive? Does it know about its existence, or is it merely executing programmed commands within its genetic code? Is it able to feel pain? These are philosophical and medical questions that even experts cannot agree upon at times. And a young man/lady in his/her early 20s thinks he/she has it figured out. It is only natural that people like myself be skeptical about the strength of the source.
As for whether it can feel pain, it is generally accepted in the world of medicine and medical ethics that a foetus at 24 weeks should not, which is why abortion is only available to those less than 24 weeks pregnant. And this is the law in Singapore, with the only exception being cases of medically proven severe or lethal foetal abnormalities.
4. Say as much as the stake you have in this.
Many people seem to be confused about their role in all this. We are merely casual observers, with no part to play in the decision. The OP had already made up her mind, as seen from how she requested for people not to give pro-life comments. Why not just let her have it her way? After all, with all your high-and-mighty attitudes, WILL ANY OF YOU DISSING HER STAND OUT AND SUPPORT HER ""physically, mentally and financially"", where she mentioned she was ill-prepared? Otherwise, who are we really, to try forcing our uninvited intervention onto her? You would be merely leading her onto the tougher path void of numerous opportunities and then ABANDONING her to suffer by herself. (Note that the caps was just meant to highlight what I believe to be the main point of my argument, given the lack of bold or italics)
5. Only say what is constructive.
The OP quite obviously has strong opinions and has made up her mind. So why bother with all the preaching? You're not going to change her mind on this anonymous platform by insulting anyone and making derogatory comments about someone else's morality. Rather than propagating and intensifying the tension between pro-life and pro-choice, shouldn't we all try to support her through this traumatising experience in one way or another, and keeping to ourselves if we have nothing productive to contribute towards her cause?
To the least, you may graciously consider how you could write a thoughtful, intelligent comment with the necessary references on how to get help ""physically, mentally and financially"", e.g. NGO and government websites, then put forth the idea that she reconsiders her decision. If you can put forward a strong case on how her fears are unfounded, I'm sure she will be more than glad to read what you have to say.
Finally, to all those who supported the OP, I'm glad that a community of individuals who believe in getting things done exist. And to those who haven't been putting much thought into the tone of their comments, please do consider the impact of your actions and words in future. Because even if you won't, others will, and their opinions of you will be based on that (aka they will judge you the same way you passed judgement on the OP).
Take care, #13345, I wish you all the best in your pursuits in uni and in life.

18502,28038,"This post is in response to #28025. I was in a similiar situation as you. I weighed over 80 kg and standing at 1.58m. I am always in the TAF club since primary school and has always been labelled as fat and obese. Somehow I managed to lost weight to 64 kg, and I gained back some weight (about 8kg) over these few years.
I don't like what I see everyday, especially when I see skinny and fit girls in school. So I decided to lose back the weight I gained these few years. At first it was like a moment of anger because people have been saying that I'm fat. Then after working out for a few weeks (I just did like a 25 min workout once every 2 days), I started to see changes to my body. My concentration was better, I was able to sleep better and had regular sleep patterns. My pants were starting to feel loose and what started out as a moment of anger turned out to be me wanting to stay healthy and fit so that I would be able to concentrate and focus better. Exercise is not so that you can attract people, but so that you can stay healthy and do the things you want to do.
It's not easy to shed the weight away, but we somehow need to take that step. Set small goals, because only you can do it. People can say nasty things to you to bring you down, but only you can prove to them with your determination! All the best girl!

18512,28050,"Dear #28025,
Here's my advice for you :)
1) You mentioned that you're 21 and you've never had a guy chase you before.
Well, I myself met my first boyfriend when I was 26 and my sister met her first boyfriend at 24 years old. Before our first relationships, we did not have suitors too. And yes, we're both overweight too. Although this might sound cliche, but you're still very young, you simply haven't met your Mr. Right yet.
2) You also mentioned that your friends asked you to slim down in order to find a boyfriend, giving you the impression that guys are superficial.
Honestly, I have many plus-sized female friends who actually have boyfriends. Some of them are even married now. I myself am also overweight but attached. What my boyfriend liked about me was my personality (kind, thoughtful, mature, etc). Thus, I would say that NOT all guys are superficial.
Yup, you don't have to change yourself at all!
Just be kind to people, be genuine, be confident :)

We are not fat shaming. We are addressing an issue of you wanting mainstream rewards, but refusing to give the mainstream price.
You clearly identified that a healthy weight, neither BMI 15 or BMI 30 is attractive to guys. But you refused to follow the mainstream concept. That is fine, you are no sheep, you can appreciate and love yourself. But you do not have the right to generalise guys as superficial, and feel entitled to a guy’s attention. You know what they want, you refuse and do not try to give them what they want, subsequently they refuse to give you what you want. That is fair. Can’t have your cake and eat it.
Genetics or not, honestly, girls have more to offer than looks. Girls with all kinds of looks get attached. But your sense of entitlement and your sweeping generalisation of half the world. That is the reason of the backlash and makes you so much less attractive. Absolutely not a fan of being tagged ‘superficial’ or ‘gold-digger’ because someone isn’t getting his/her way in life.

Most of the time, guys are attracted initially to looks and this attraction is maintained by interest in the girl's personality and character. I'm healthy weight, but I have shit low self-confidence and I think that's why guys don't get attracted to me (or I have a shit ugly face <-- LOL point) but anyways, the superficiality is not only restricted to guys. Some girls are superficial too.
Would you date a guy who's 100kg but has an above average face with cute boyish looks? If yes then okay lor~ I'm pretty sure in your life, you might find someone (like that) who likes you, but then you might have that double standards (you claim guys have).

I am in a similar position to you, actually. I'm perhaps a bit smaller than you, at 70+ kg and 160cm. I'm fat. Yeah I'll admit that. But I'll also defend myself by saying I am more physically fit than most of my peers who are slimmer. Hear me out, all you haters who are about to flame me the same way you were flaming the other OP. I go for 3km runs at least twice a week. Whenever I go trekking with my friends, my stamina is obviously better. I used to be a competitive swimmer until JC. Doctors have performed stress tests and checked my lung capacity and my GI health and all of those things have come back better than normal. It can't be traced to an endocrine malfunction. I'm perfectly healthy. I'm just fat. You know why? Mostly because I love food.
I used to hate my body. I tried to starve myself a couple times. I dropped 5kg in two weeks, and it was addictive. I also stopped getting my period. I would get cold easily (I didn't think that's even possible in this climate). I got tired even faster than I got cold. My grades dropped. I didn't have the energy to care about anything except not eating.
By the time I lost 15 kg my bf got scared. Wait a minute! Got bf? Then why need starve lah? I had a boyfriend who loved me while I was fat. So why should I change? It had something to do with the way all you haters are flaming that other OP about being her ""best self"". Relatives and friends would tell me I really need to lose weight. Eventually I believed them. I didn't understand that my best self was the strong, fit individual with a large appetite. I'd been okayed by the doctor. So I knew I was already healthy. But I listened to those people who thought the only way I could be my ""best self"" was to be slim. At first, I tried simply eating less. My diet was already very good in quality, but maybe not quantity. After a couple months of painstakingly counting calories and calculating energy used by every activity, I got fed up. (No pun intended). There were no results. I was as fat as ever, and miserable as well. I decided that if I was going to put so much effort into this, I'd have to do something much more extreme in order to get results.
I got results, as noted earlier. My boyfriend noticed first and tried to show his concern. I was irritable at this point and dismissed his careful confrontations. Eventually he got some of my closer friends involved in a sort of mini intervention. I got better, I got help. I've been learning about body image ever since.
OP, whatever you do, don't go down the same path I did. Focus your efforts on being healthy, not slim. Keep yourself active. Eat a healthy diet to get all your nutrients. You only have one body, so appreciate it and love it and care for it. It can do so many things, like climb those stairs to CLB. Explore the things it can do, and push yourself further. You'd be surprised what you can do. It really doesn't matter what you look like, as long as you're healthy.
I'm very confident you'll find someone who is able to love you. Work on being your ""best self"", but don't let others define that for you. We all can improve. Always strive for the best.

18525,28064,"#28047: if you go on the internet looking for solidarity and support, you not only bark up the wrong tree; you are barking up the wrong tree, in the wrong postal code, and there is a fucking pack of vicious leopards waiting to jump all over you. I suggest something like tumblr, aka: the most easily offended site on the internet (though I can assure you I found no shortage of weird shit there).
https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/fat-is-beautiful
After the previous show of modest solidarity with you, here's what I have to say about some of your claims. You being 80 kgs did not bother me, but the factually wrong things you wrote set me off. There is a difference between fit and healthy. Fit = able to do feats of physical prowess. Healthy = without disease. A fit person is likely to be healthy, but not always. and vice versa. There have been quite a number of cases where a somewhat fit National Service man dropped dead after a routine 15km march. Likewise, healthiness depends not only on weight number, fat percentage, or size, but also activity level. Research have shown that an overweight man with an obvious belly doing manual physical work is healthier than an office worker who looks lean and go to the gym. I had a female colleague who is super thin, like a twig ready to be blown away by the winds. Well, she had high cholesterol and blood lipids.
That said, what is exactly your physical activity level: do you sit for most of your day: on bus, train, lecture hall, library, on the couch, whatever. Also, when was the last time you have a medical check up? We had a practice during one of our Physiology module where we took each other's blood pressure. We could not measure some people's BP. It turned out that their BP was so high that we simply did not think about it and did not pressure the ballast enough. Some were in the 120-180 range (normal is 80-120-ish). They entered University with normal BP but a few years of fast food, sedentary lifestyle, and stress sent it over. Get a simple check up: BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol. If you can, get an some ultrasound. You'll be surprised. Or get a body fat percentage estimate and see if it's in the normal range.
As for the wide frame claim. OK, wrap your index finger and thumb around your wrist (on the opposite hand) as tight as you can. Is the thumb overlapping your index finger? Or do they just touch? Or are they separated? If your thumb overlaps the index finger, you have a small frame. If they just touch, that's a normal frame. If they don't, that's a wide frame. The body frame affect less than you might think. Take whatever ""ideal"" weight, as indicated by the BMI chart (Singapore's Health Promotion Board recommend 23 and below, based on research indicated risk for Asian population), subtract 10% for a small frame, add 10% for a wide frame. For your BMI to be ""healthy"" (as promoted by Singapore HPB), you need to be around 1.78m tall.
Detox is mostly bullshit and the only thing it cleanses is your bank account. Your liver and kidney will do all the detoxing you'll ever need; unless you have kidney or liver failure. At that stage, a pill, juice cleanse, or detox water just won't help. You need a dialysis machine, or a transplant. Save that money and go for a checkup.
I generally don't label people who prefer X or Y. However, I do laugh a lot if their choice ends up blowing in their face. A richer husband, or a poorer husband generally increases the likelihood of cheating. If he's a lot richer, it's as if he earns the right to cheat because he works ""harder"". If he's poorer, he feels powerless in the relationship, so he cheats to get that power back. The sweet spot, according to research seems to be the wife earning 70% of the husband. Choosing someone purely for one unique selling point: look, virginity, whatever, may eventually backfires because the personality is rotten, they are useless otherwise, and the cruel, unrelenting march of time. Yes, I will laugh. And if you stay exactly they way you are, and ending up a crazy cat lady, yes, I will also laugh.
I'm not superficial. I'm just cruel, sociopath, and psychopath. You can't believe how happy I am when my cousin's marriage was breaking up. In the eyes of my parents and her parents, their marriage was the perfect match up: handsome husband, pretty wife, both highly educated with stable jobs in banking. Also, rich parents from both sides. Just some hiccups along the way: fundamentally, he's a bit dim, slow, and without a good sense of humor. She has a massive ego and a rather picky person. Actually everyone, including the parents has massive egos. And their marriage is failing.

18526,28063,"To all those who are taking on a lecturing tone towards #28025 on how unhealthy she is, I find it surprising that you can assume to know better about what's good for someone you have never known personally. You don't know her. Her struggles, her personality, her beliefs, her interests or her looks are all unknown to you, yet you seem to have already believed her to be someone without self control, without discipline, someone who's weak and without determination.
I find myself wanting to post this confession for her and for everyone who genuinely think that fat people are somehow primarily characterised by these characteristics. I disagree with her generalisations on guys, but feel that apart from OP's view on relationships, the shaming comments towards her have to be addressed.
I have always been overweight since primary school. This of course affected my self esteem, and up to lower secondary I always had little confidence in myself. My secondary school though had always taken PE lessons seriously, and I joined a CCA that required me to be relatively physically active, and while I have always hated running (other physical stuff's fine), I never lagged behind my peers and could always keep up.
But through it all, I hated my body. I hated how my waistline was thicker than everyone else; hated how my relatives would always comment about my body with snide remarks and contempt, as if being fat somehow made me lesser, made me less significant. When you're fat, it seems that your weight is the first thing everyone notices and want to talk about when they see you- not your academic ability, not how many people you've helped, and certainly not how happy you are. Because when you're fat, it sometimes seems like you lose agency over your own body. That somehow everyone wants to dictate what you can or cannot eat; what you can or cannot do. Fat people must be that way cos they don't know better, right?
So sometime in Sec2/3, the comments finally really got to me. I decided that perhaps what everyone was saying was true. I decided that by virtue of being fat, I was a failure of a person. As a fat person, I didn't deserve to eat well. As a fat person, I was such a bad example to everyone around me. And as such a failure, I didn't deserve the same things everyone had. So I started to punish myself. I would consider the day an absolute victory if I could get through 6am-6pm without eating anything but water and tea. My self esteem plummeted to ridiculous levels (that now appear silly since I started justifying to myself that I didn't deserve to even use hot water at home). This continued for almost 2 years before I managed to see how ridiculous I was being. (I did lose weight during this period, although not after the initial few months)
I guess, my point is, is this what you want to do when you post such comments? To compel someone through a tough psychological journey that will hopefully make them improve their lives? (Newsflash: It won't) I would guess that these shaming comments have been seen or heard by OP, and in fact by many others numerous times already and are nothing new. I have moved on in many ways from this period, but am bringing it up again to remind those who care that shaming doesn't help matters.
So please, reconsider the next time you post such comments. You don't know OP. You don't know me. And somehow, I don't think that having seen a glimpse of OP though her 2 posts is enough for you to be telling her how much discipline or control she lacks. What it does accomplish is contribute to a culture of fat shaming - a toxic, problematic phenomenon where the damage is more often than not, deeply psychological. Even if you have the best of intentions, I think there's no harm in trying your best to be a sensitive individual who encourages without shaming. The internet is already negative enough, so why not spread some more positivity? :)

18529,28068,"To the ones putting down the OP of #28025, please stop it.
(Sorry for the long post)
People who said that 'fat' or not is not dependent on genetics, and is dependent on lifestyle, eating habits etc, sorry but genetics do play a part. Some have a set of genes that predisposes them to gaining fat while others have a set of genes to help them stay lean. Variance in genetics do affect your susceptibility to obesity. In addition, the variation in individuals' hormones production do affect how much weight we gain or loss, and some examples are insulin, thyroid, estrogen and testosterone. So yes, genetics, how your body is formed, do play a part in whether you are likely to get fat anot.
But OP, do note that this is not a good reason for you to stay in the 80kg range, and that staying there does not mean that you are normal just because of your genetics and built of your body. Regardless of what, healthy is the most important and being overweight do results in a series of diseases I believe you don't want to have at this age. Losing weight is not just for finding boyfriend (tbh, i know girls who are obese and do have boyfriends, so that might not be the only factor), but rather for your health. At this age, it's easier to lose weight and as you grow, the metabolism slows down and it's even easier to gain weight and harder to lose! So don't waste the prime time:)
For people putting down her on her attitude, please try to understand her. She has her own insecurities despite putting up her strong front and saying that she love herself for who she is. No matter what, she will be affected by her friends constantly asking her to lose weight and the fact that she still doesn't have any boyfriend. She was seeking for some reassurance so she can build up on self-esteem and do something about it (not trying to say it's right or not), and when y'all start putting her down, of course she would get defensive and try to protect herself more.
So please stop doing that, good intentions or not, the way you phrase your words and the tone you put in your sentence is important. You can't tell someone what to do, but you can encourage them to do it without putting them down.

You did ask why guys never really chase you considering your physical appearance, and I guess that's what you got from the NUSWhispers commenters. You got what you asked for, lol.
It's not just guys who are superficial, though. Don't us girls have our very own guy crushes? I am someone who falls for a guy's personality rather than their looks, but I'm not ashamed to say that I can be superficial too. Girl, admit it: wouldn't you rather be talking to a stranger who's close to Benedict Cumberbatch (or [insert your male celebrity crush here]) in terms of looks rather than a stranger who looks like Napoleon Dynamite? First impressions matter, and unfortunately light travels faster than sound.
Honestly, I'm no skinny attractive bitch. I used to be overweight during my first 3 years of uni (currently sitting on the borderline). I've never really been chased during those 3 years, though some folks have remarked I was pretty cute (inb4 npnt). I had many guy friends but I was only a bro to them and nothing more. I never really thought my weight was a problem up until I had the problem of being unable to get cute clothes in my size (yeah plus sized lines exist but they weren't really my type). In the end I made up my mind to lose weight - because I wanted to, and not because I wanted to attract guys. I also wanted to lose weight because my ankles killed me back then, despite being only 60+kg.
That aside, if you're happy with your body, then that's your call. Pretty sure there's gonna be a guy out there who wouldn't mind how you look like.

I will not deal with the many things people have said. Like how guys being this, girl being that, ""you too"" argument, etc ... I'll just point out the factual errors in what you wrote.
First, and this is for everyone: fit does not mean healthy. Fit means you are capable of doing impressive feats of physical activity. Healthy means you are without disease. There have been a lot of stories of somewhat fit National Service men dropped dead after a mere 15 km routine march. They are fit, but not exactly healthy. Healthy does not mean fit either. Healthy, however, is as good as the medical technology allows you to diagnose or what you were made aware of. I know I have cardiac arrhythmia, fat accumulation in the liver, and an increased risk for stroke, only because I go for specific check ups. Many people will just continue living in blissful unawareness until one day, they just suddenly find they have high blood pressure, cancer, AIDS, or heart disease.
Second, weight, or BMI alone is one way to predict someone's health or propensity to have obesity-related diseases. It's a rather crude way, and also affected by basal level of physical activities. Someone who is overweight (as in BMI above the level recommended) but have a physically active job is healthier than someone who has the recommended BMI but a sedentary office job, and actually go to the gym. Better measurements could be: blood pressure, blood cholesterol, blood lipid, kidney function, cardiac health (by doing an ECG), and liver function (or whether you have fatty liver). My point is: get an actual checkup from a doctor. You might be surprised. We were having a Blood Pressure measuring practical once and we discovered that some of us have BP in the 120-180 range. They were normal just years ago, but fast food, stress, lack of sleep, and sedentary sent it over.
Third, some research showed that the extremely obese die first, then the extremely thin, then the ""norma"" weight, then the slightly overweight. The theory is the extra fat is useful in absorbing the stress of modern life. But then some also show that caloric restriction (70% of usual calorie intake) can extend life by 30% (in animal studies).
Fourth, most ""detox"" regimen do nothing. Your liver and kidney do all the detoxing. The only thing a ""detox"" regimen cleans out is your bank account. Stop wasting money on that and actually go for a checkup.

It's a little interesting how you've simply dismissed her writing off of 50% of the world as superficial beings as an extension of her insecurities and instead, hope that others would offer her encouragement. What kind of encouragement if she prefers to be delusional? ""It's okay, everything is fine. Even the massive clogging of your arteries."" Big is not beautiful, I'm sorry. If no one else bothers putting it plainly, I'll put it as it is.
Genetics being part of the problem? Sure. But it doesn't mean that nothing can be done about it. I'm sure whining about the unfairness of our mortal existence helps, sure, that she's been dealt a bad hand. Certainly. I'm sure writing off half the world as superficial works beating the flab. Alright, noted.
Just wondering what would the responses be if it was a guy that made a similar post. I'm sure he'd be blasted for being a misogynist and a whiny loser who should deal with it. Not sympathy, not encouragement. Being born with a pussy seems to give you a free pass on anything these days. Learn to deal with it and move on.

That feeling of rejection by the opposite gender simply because of my physical attributes is frustrating. I have been told right in the face that I would never be anyone's type because I'm a ""dwarf"". During one of the orientation camps, some girls stayed up to HTHT at the sleeping area. They were discussing which guys would be their ideal type. Then when they talked about me, they were like ""eeew he's too short"". Luckily I pretended to be asleep so it wasn't awkward.
To the OP of #28025, being judged just because of your physical appearance is painful... i feel you. But at least over sized girls have got moral vigilantes to watch their back when they're being discriminated against.
On the other hand, no one would call a girl superficial for disliking short guys and we're supposed to simply accept the criticism. It's not even socially acceptable or politically correct to defend a short guy for being subjected to prejudice.

I'm my opinion, I do not consider it a rape. Because the sex act was consensual, and this includes the act till the finish (literally). It is both of you who failed to use protection.

Okay many people have slammed me on my confession, so let me clarify things first.
Both the guy and I already long had an agreement beforehand that he would pull out first before shooting his load, because I felt that raw penetration would feel better than if he had a condom on. I already was aware of the risks, and was prepared to take responsibility should I somehow end up pregnant. But I'm upset because he broke our agreement when he ejaculated inside me. I thought we had reached an agreement, yet he didn't keep to his promise.
When I realized he was going to come inside, I protested and tried to get him to pull out, but he didn't budge. He held on to me tightly and shot all of his load inside me.
Many people seem to support the notion that ""I brought it upon myself"" for ""not taking enough careful measures"" just because I gave consent to sex. Isn't that victim blaming? Does that mean that if someone did that to your sister, you'd find no fault with that guy? If you're a guy and you had a similar agreement before doing the deed, does it mean that you condone the act of breaking your promise to your girl (i.e ejaculating inside her against her will)?

If you think you are gonna be sleeping around anywhere anytime then always carry condoms with you. Don't cry wolf when you allowed the wolf in. You should know by now guys will always be pushy during sex. Not that the man is right, but you are wrong to have unprotected sex. People like you contribute to unwanted pregnancies & STIs. By law, it might be considered rape. Seek a lawyer's opinion and take legal actions if you really feel violated. But bear in mind, you allowed him in. Be a smart lady, protect yourself always. Don't even try the withdrawal method. Stay safe during sex. I'm a female btw.

Though the judge ""might"" borrow the reasoning from a foreign case, or to do it for political reasons (like not making Singapore look like uncultured savages). There has been no precedent for such case in Singapore yet, so it's all up to the exact judge.
Anyway, back to the OP's case. I'm not going to pass a judgement on that, but I am about to outline a few options. Yes, you are free to go to the police. They exist for a reason. However, they might not press the charge for the case. If you get pregnant, that's perfect evidence, otherwise, where's the evidence. Another point is they may just laugh at you, may be not to your face, but behind you, and passing judgements behind your face. If the prosecutor finds no opportunity to convict, he/she will not take it on. Feel free to.
Now if you are REALLY keen on making the guy pay, there are legal counselling services for sex victims. Or you can hire your own attorneys and try to get the case through criminal court. If not a criminal case, but you get pregnant, you can always press a civil case, asking for compensations and such. But you start whining, where do I find the money (Singaporean lawyers charge you by the hour); well, we all have prices to pay.
However, I will still stand by my original judgement of your action, which has nothing to do with whether that guy raped you or not. You are still an idiot for having unprotected sex with a person with unknown STD status. You are what contribute to the statistics. Still, my advice for you is to pursue the case to the bitter end, for the same reason that I tell my American friends to look forward to a Trump presidency: ""it might be shit and horrifying for you, but for sure it's gonna being interesting and entertaining for the rest of us"".
To pre-empt people in the comment calling me a horrible, psychopathic, schadenfreude, whatever: I know that I am. And I enjoy every moment of it. And you should know also about Mr Trump and his supporters: they revel in hatred. I am not a Trump supporter but I will support the fun that comes out of his administration (I would have vote for Bernie if I could).
Just call me Hitler so we can get the Hitler singularity in Internet comments, 'kay?

20777,31708,"#31697 what motivates me to write this is not a sentiment that somehow you are at fault. I'm not gonna say things like you brought it on yourself or you were not careful. I'm just irritated at how badly constructed your arguments are.
Now, what you described is ""generally"" a clear breach of contract/agreement. Yes, contract does not need to be written, nor there is a limit on how trivial it might be. Yes he was wrong. However, to say that someone is committing a criminal offense, especially when there is no law regarding it, it MUST come down to a judge at court. In order to bring the case to court, a prosecutor must judge the case to see if it is worthy of their time. That means the police as well. I am just not very sure they will. Perhaps some of them will write articles to ridicule you.
Then there is the issue of proving the intent. How can you prove that it was intentional? It's basically he said, she said. Furthermore, where's the physical evidence? If you do get pregnant, man that's just perfect. But if you don't and he swears up and down that he did pull out and shoot it straight into your left eye, trailing down your face and ended at your right nipple. Who would the judge believe?
That does not mean you absolutely can not press any charges. You can find an advocacy organisation that is loud enough to press it for you. Still, you might be in danger of being grouped with a bunch of loonies. You can hire your own attorneys to press various charges, like a civil case of breaching an agreement in a Small Claims (?) court. That might just be the most hilarious court case ever. There is an oftenly ridiculed case of an old lady suing McDonalds for burning her with their hot take away coffee. At least in that case, that lady suffered a 3rd degree burn to her crotch and genital area and her medical bills were in the hundreds of thousands.
See, you do have lots of options. It might take years, it might make you an unwitting target of the news and tabloids, and it will certainly make your sexual history public. They will attempt to get your sexual history, interview your past flings and dates. Then some dudes with handsome enough payment will divulge highly intimate details like whether you like a landing strip or a full-brazilian, or what is your favourite position. Oh and those information will be used by the defender's lawyers to paint you as a total slut in court anyway. Real rape case where the girl is drugged, drunk, passed out in a party went down that way. Yes, how prosmicuous you were before the encounter should have no bearing on whether a rape has happened or not; but that does not mean a lawyer will not use it against you. They will bang on the fact. If they can not bang on the fact, they bang on the law. And if they can not bang on the law, they will bang on the table.
Finally, you created an ad hominem attack ""if it were your sister, mother, etc ... would you still think the same?"" This is a logical fallacy. But since you ask. I will laugh. Yes, I will. Because it would be hilarious, she would have been an idiot, and I am a bit of a schadenfraude. Now, if it were me and I were having a casual fling. Fuck no! The fact that you were so eager to have unprotected sex with me give me serious doubts about who else have done it with you. Not that I don't trust you, I don't trust the previous dudes. Some 10% of sexually active people (American stats) have some kind of STIs. Not to mention: pregnancy. It's a headache for everyone.
I have a rule: no mucosal membrane touching anyone I do not know the full medical history of. Now by mucosal membrane I meant oral sex included, if you are not a biology-minded person. Kissing is acceptable, provided that no visible sores present.

Typical use failure rate for withdrawal as a contraception method is more than 18-27% based on various studies. Perfect use failure rate is less than 4%. The large difference between the typical use and perfect use suggests that many guys are unable to withdraw in time. If you get into such risky acts, you should know the consequences. He is still blameworthy, but I hope you understand rape is a very serious charge and you can ascribe criminal blame one party alone for a combined stupidity. If you really want to be safe, use condoms (even they are not perfect).

20785,31720,"This is a response to #31646 and the very interesting (and heated) replies it has generated. It is heartening to see the level of interest in issues of law and the criminal justice amongst the younger generation, as should indeed be the case in a society that aspires to the rule of law.
Many of the comments have deviated into very abstract analyses and analogies, which is perhaps understandable for a community made up largely of idealistic and passionately opinionated students. However, what you must realise is that although the law may lay down rules and principles, these are applied through human agency and this has a very significant impact on the outcome.
In the scenario, it is not disputed that the girl has consented to unprotected sex; indeed, she wanted it to be unprotected for the intimacy. What she is claiming is that she did not consent to ejaculation inside her. There are two issues that follow from this:
1. Ejaculation is a natural consequence of sex. It is not inevitable, but it is natural, and ordinarily it happens in most cases. So the question is can you consent to sex but not to ejaculation? It is not reasonable; just like how you cannot consent to surfboarding while at the same time insisting you do not consent to falling in the water. Yes, you and your partner can try not to make it happen, but when you consent to engage in something you consent to the consequences that in normal circumstances would flow from it. So if consent to sex remained present at all times it is not reasonable to argue that the girl refused consent to ejaculation.
2. You could argue that the girl withdrew consent at some point during the sex. Legally, consent to sex can be withdrawn at any time and if the male proceeds thereafter, it is rape. Well and good, but ok - this is your law books end and the real world begins. Prove it. Prove that you withdrew your consent and clearly communicated your withdrawal of consent at some point during the shagging, before the ejaculation. Was there a known safeword like in BDSM that you spoke and was ignored? Do you have a recording? Do you have proof of an agreement? Do you think you will have evidence to support this, and do you think the Prosecution Service will be convinced there is enough evidence to charge (bearing in mind this was consensual sex from the beginning)? Also, are you willing to testify and face detailed cross-examination on this? These are realities that face our investigative agencies, the legal fraternity and our stakeholders every day.
In view of the two points above, may I humbly suggest that if you do not or cannot accept the natural consequences of sex, you either (a) take the necessary precautions or (b) refrain from having sex. This seems awfully obvious, but it is perhaps a sign of the times nowadays that such a simple point now needs to be explained and defended.
Analogies and arguments that stray too far from the facts disclosed by the OP are unhelpful. Nobody is saying that once consent to sex is given ""you can do anything"", or crap of that sort. This is a unique scenario where consent was given but supposedly not to one of the naturally-flowing consequences; stick to the facts. If any of you are law students, it bears repetition that (1) justice is justice according to the law, not according to the mob; and (2) the law is applied to the facts and only the facts, not what one imagines to be the facts.
Thanks for your consideration.

20787,31727,"I read with much interest the well-reasoned and thoughtful response in #31720 to the many posts about the girl who did not consent to her partner ejaculating inside of her. I'm glad to see that this important discussion about the nature of sexual consent is happening, and that it has attracted such mature and thoughtful responses. However, I must disagree with most of them (which have focused on slamming and scolding the OP in #31646). What happened to her is, morally, rape - even if the legal position is unclear. Our response should therefore not be to shame her, even if we personally think she is foolish. Let me make 3 points that follow from this. For the purposes of this discussion, let's assume that everything the OP said is true, although it is of course possible that it isn't.
1. Rape is having sex with a person (of whatever gender) without their consent. Very few people would disagree with this. What many of us have argued is that this situation is not rape, because ejaculation is a ""natural consequence"" of sex and therefore consent to unprotected sex automatically means consent to ejaculation inside of her. With respect, this is factually untrue. As a guy, I know for certain that men can control themselves and pull out when they feel like coming. If you don't believe me, just read men's websites which are filled with techniques on how to have more pleasurable orgasms by prolonging the time taken to ""come"". It is simply not true that once the guy put his penis into her, he was physiologically unable to control himself. Therefore, it was eminently reasonable for her to expect him to pull out, in fact, ""pulling-out"" was the main method of contraception before the advent of condoms and such an instance is even referenced in the biblical book of Genesis (the story of Onan, for those interested).
Some of us may say that the guy was simply careless, and should not be punished for *rape*. Morally and legally, this is an untenable position. Many things are immoral and punished severely even though they are careless, reckless or negligent acts. A good example is dangerous driving causing death. If we would not excuse a driver who killed someone out of carelessness from some sort of punishment, then similarly the man in this scenario should not be excused. Should he have a lighter punishment? Morally, I don't think so. Legally, that is for the judge to decide.
2. Second, the evidence. Many have pointed out that the allegations made by the OP would be very difficult to prove. Unfortunately, this is true. However, that doesn't mean that it isn't wrong, it shouldn't be a crime or that it shouldn't be prosecuted. Almost all sexual crimes are very difficult to prove, because most rapes are not committed by random strangers in the street but by acquaintances. That doesn't mean we stop trying to stop rape or start blaming the victims.
Some may be curious as to the legal position on this issue. To my knowledge, the Singapore courts have not dealt with such a case before. Should it come before them, my own view is that it would be considered rape. Several other jurisdictions have ruled that similar cases are rape, most notably this position has been taken in England, which Singapore often follows closely (for those interested, the case to read is Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority).
3. Finally, victim blaming. Most of the responses so far have focused on blaming the OP for being foolish and stupid, or on saying that she ""should have known"". This is a wrong, and dangerous response. True, she may have in fact been foolish. But our *focus* should not be on blaming women for being foolish, but on teaching both men and women to control themelves, be responsible for their own urges and respect other people's wishes. This line of thought is what will help society fight sexual assault instead of encouraging people to view women as the only ones responsible for their own safety. Again, I'm not saying that women (or anyone) should not take care of themselves. I'm saying that society should *focus* on righting the wrong and punishing the offender (as it does with robbery, murder, etc) rather than telling victims to be more careful (as people tend to do with sexual assault).
Have a great day everyone!

Although I am on your side, unlike that troll who keeps pasting the same article on every single confession related to this, I am actually going to give you some advice on what's your next step, and hopefully you will be able to find something that can help you.
Give up on trying to sue him. Before you switch off, hear me out first. Let's be honest, this is not a typical rape case, hence your chance of winning is pretty low. Plus, by now all the evidence is probably gone and it's just a ""he say she say"" situation. Not mentioning the amount of money you need to waste on filing a lawsuit.. Etc. (I am no lawyer sorry but I know it's expensive)
With that out of the way.. What are your next steps? It's too late for morning after pill so don't even need to get that anymore. Get yourself a pregnancy test, if it comes out positive, get an abortion pill. If you don't want the baby, don't drag it, so that you won't need to have a surgery. If you want to keep it, I think you know what to do. If it's negative, then good for you, it's a lesson learnt.
I think you know you made a wrong decision (casual sex, sex without protection), and I am pretty sure that you will never forget this lesson or be careless again. Everyone makes mistakes, it's okay. But don't waste your energy on something that's not worth it, and will only bring more pain to yourself (everyone - even more people than right now, is gonna question you and blame you the moment you make yourself public with the story). Your focus should be taking care of yourself, remember the lesson learnt, and think of what's the next step from here.
I hope I helped. :)

21637,33053,"I am the OP of #33027 and this is in response to some of the comments received.
Please educate yourself on the difference between an ancient and a primitive society. I never mentioned what went on in 'ancient' societies, though incidentally I disagree with the claim that nobody knows what these people wore since we do have a fairly clear idea. Again, please educate yourself on archaeological findings and the fact that not just Rome/Greece, but also China and south India were ancient societies too. Same goes for the commenter who brought up '300' - way to go missing the point of the post.
Primitive societies, on the other hand, are all around us if you look beyond this island, and it is those I was referring to (or at least those in the same climate region as we are). The question I raised, looking at male and female attire in these societies, is why with 'progress' we become less comfortable with male skin exposure and more welcoming of its female counterpart. Strange that you should bring up the Bushmen - that illustrates my point exactly. Do you have any idea what Bushmen attire (or lack of it) is?
The point I wanted to make is why there is this modern-day discrimination in terms of male skin exposure in casual/formal contexts being ""eww"" (or even criminal) but equivalent female exposure is celebrated as some kind of freedom or liberation. Functionally this means that in many contexts men don't get to choose the kind of light, airy and short clothing that some might prefer in this climate, and which are accessible without question or ridicule to women. Thanks to those who managed to get the point.
Last thought by the way - if you are all for freedom and equality then men wearing dresses should be just as acceptable as women wearing suits. Treating one as a kind of embarrassment while celebrating the other just belies your subconscious acknowledgment of one gender's superiority over the other.
I by no means want to carry on a 'debate' behind anonymity and so I assure the moderators that if published this will be my last post on this issue. Just thought I needed to set that one point straight, and the anonymity is convenient to raise perspectives that I believe are unjustifiably shunned or considered deviant by society. Thanks.

Why should I be responsible for it? She benefited from the sexual joy too, that’s why she keep on coming back to me for more. Furthermore, everytime I’m the one paying for condom, she didn’t even pay a single cent.
Basically, I’m indignant and annoyed that why girls like to play the victim game when they get pregnant? Why the onus is always on the guy to be responsible? It takes 2 hands to clap, I didn’t force her to have sex with me. Also, it’s not as if she don’t know the risk. She did all these willingly knowing that it’s fwb relationship.
Where is gender equality? Isn’t it unfair to EXPECT guy to be responsible, especially it’s stated it’s a free from responsibility fwb relationship?

Do you even know what fwb relationship means? It’s a no string attached relationship with no commitment, obligation or responsibility!! Go google the definition!
If I want responsibility, I would have gotten a legit girlfriend already. It is precisely that I don’t want responsibility, that’s why I engage in fwb act!
If I go prostitution and got the prostitute pregnant, am I expected to be responsible too? C’mon man, don’t white knight and oppress male in every way!!

39393,61568,"To #61519 and any other people who are facing the same issue, as long as you two agreed to sleep together, you two should be responsible for it. It's mentally draining for girls to go clinics and deal with it alone. And it is unfair to push all responsibilities on the guys.
To guys, a girl can't get pregnant without your sperms. The kid may not be in your body, but you still contributed to the creation of the kid. Go to the clinic with the girl, split the abortion fee, be there with the girl even after the abortion, just go through it together because it's the two of you who made the mistake.
To girls, the kid is in you, you can't run away from the responsibilities even if you want to. So don't be delusional and say things like 'you got me pregnant!' You can't be pregnant if you don't agree to the sex. It's right to get your fwb to be responsible for it, but not fully responsible. If the guy is there with you throughout the whole journey, be thankful that you are not going through it alone.
But honestly, if you have a kid, time is crucial. Get it over and done with and quarrel about responsibility later. If you two can't handle the responsibility issue now, you definitely do not want the child to grow bigger to the point where you can't have an abortion and have to talk about another form of responsibility. And if you don't feel old and mature enough to handle such responsibilities, don't get fwbs.

39401,61580,"Just wanna say, there’s no responsibility or shared responsibility in fwb. Go google the definition of fwb, it’s an uncommitted sexual relationship with no string attached and no responsibility.
That’s why the conservative people, good people and religious people condemn fwb because they can’t stand irresponsible and uncommitted relationship.
Since OP and his gf in post #61519 already agreed to be in irresponsible fwb relationship, why is she still demanding responsibility from guy?
If she want responsibility, she should have gotten into a legit bgr in the first place, isn’t it? Why fwb when she know it’s gonna be irresponsible and yet still expect guy to be responsible?!

39407,61595,"#61519 from one bro to another, idk why nobody is asking if you're sure it's your kid, because that's the first question we would ask.
Honestly, that's the first question any fkboy would ask, but ya I guess I count as one.
From experience, most of the time when I have fwbs, they have other fwbs on the side too. NSA also means you guys are not exclusively banging each other, and usually that means multiple partners la.
Just want you to be sure so you don't end up paying for some other dude's ""accident"".
To all the SJWs out there, don't be so quick to jump on the dude. I nearly got the abortion pinned on me before. I'm medically sterile, can't have kids. But I'll still strongly advise you to use condoms cause risk of STI is real even if you're sterile too y'know.
She tried to pin it on me anyway, claiming that I'm her only fwb, and she only had sex with me. Constantly insisting that she doesn't have any other fwb, until I told her I was sterile, and then she finally fessed up to having other guys but that they wouldn't pay.
In this case I don't think it's fair for me to pay up, if I was responsible for the accident yeah, I'd split the cost 50/50, but that's just a theory since I can't have kids anyway. So for yall, stop judging the poor dude with only like 25% of the story. He might not even be the father for all we know, and you're just gonna blindly ascribe responsibility to him just cause the girl's accusing him. It's this kinda shit that ruined MeToo, cause we jumped on people just cause someone said so, not even making sure that the story was correct in the first place.
You wanna go on a witchhunt, be sure of it first. Most of the dudes caught under MeToo I'd say deserved it very much, but I'm not sure about some of them and that just sours the movement some.
If you ask me, yall should be calling for them to split the damn bill and share the responsibility, not banging the PC view that the man must take responsibility... as if the girl can't make her own decisions. It's 2019, since we want gender equality, start by splitting responsibilities more fairly.

39415,61610,"It's me again, the poster of #61519. To the salty white knights, please stop embarrassing yourselves.
I think I should reiterate that being fwbs, we AGREED that it is a free-from-responsibility relationship. But the situation is that she backed out from the agreement, blamed me for it and want me to take full RESPONSIBILITY for it.
By responsibility, I mean being tied down to her for the rest of my life. She doesn't even want an abortion in the first place! And mind you, she refused to take any form of preventive measures(pills) when we did it. I am the only one forking out the money for the condoms.
Basically, I'm annoyed that she played the victim card and did not at the very least shoulder some of the blame/responsibility? Please, I would want to hear from people with genuine fwb experiences on this topic, not some salty virgins.

39434,61648,"hi #61610 i'm writing this assuming that you're the father of that fetus
when you guys agreed to be in a free-from-responsibility relationship, was pregnancy in the picture? did she explicitly agree that if she got knocked up you will be FREE from ANY responsibility?? she asked you to take FULL RESPONSIBILITY and you're saying she's not shouldering any responsibility at all? don't be dumb she will be the one carrying the baby, going through the painful birth AND take care of the baby for life. if you run away like a coward she will face the stigma of being a single mum and YOUR CHILD will not have a dad. not shouldering any responsibility you say..?
were you forced to fork out money for the condoms? obv not, you were probably excited to be using it when you bought them. do you want to claim ignorance that condoms are not 100% effective?
the blame is on both of you. y'all made the decision to be in fwb so take responsibility of the consequences of your decisions. don't play the victim card by claiming fReE fRoM rEsPoNsIbIlItY.
anyway i hope you actually become a better person since you're a dad-to-be. all the best and stop arguing about who should be blamed and step up like a human being.

39440,61655,"#61624 I had some pain in my scrotal area maybe 5 years back, assumed it to be some UTI (since I wasn't sexually active yet) and went to the doctor to get it checked. For some reason he decided to do a sperm count and other investigations, tests came back with the diagnosis of prostatitis and positive for antisperm antibodies.
Sterile since then. It's been a few years, I can't remember what he was saying anymore, all I remember is basically that he told me it's practically impossible for me to have kids.
Kinda sucks, but I'm planning on adopting anyway even if I don't get married.

39451,61676,"People on NUSWhispers are becoming more and more hateful. Can yall just be more kind for a second. Telling the author of #61519 to ""man up"" or ""have some balls"" is not just unhelpful but also just straight up toxic masculinity. Imagine if those things would happen to you, give honest opinion on what you would do in other's perspective.
Remember how FWB is a two-way agreement. It requires biparty involvement and responsibility.
And stop being so hateful and be more kind. Life is too short to always take everything personally with your bigotry, dogmatism.
