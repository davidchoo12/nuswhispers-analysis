Based on #2735's logic, we should save the strangers since they are more likely to pass on our genes than our parents (who have already passed on theirs). Generally, most of us save our parents. This doesn't show an evolutionary purpose. Using the evolutionary account doesn't explain fully the reasons behind an action, there is a need to factor in human relations. Otherwise, we would start saving strangers.

Some people are saying that Singapore is largely a conservative society, as evidenced by the Singapore law. But is Singapore still a largely conservative society? Do the current laws reflect what the majority of Singaporeans think?
I am straight, and most, if not all, of the people I know who are also straight are very open to the idea of homosexuality.
I am not an expert in the Singapore justice system, but just think about this question: who decides what laws to pass? Do Singaporeans vote on what laws to pass, or does the decision lie in the hands of a few ministers.
Take the recent liquor law as an example. The law was passed based on the majority of a focus group of 40+ people and a couple of hundred surveys agreeing to law being passed. Where did they get the sample from and who did they ask? They sure did not ask for my opinion and neither they ask the other 5 million Singaporeans, including you. How are the results representative of what he majority of Singaporeans think? Were the results rigged?
My point is: could it be that the truly conservative people are the ministers (who are most likely be from the older generation) who enacted the law?
And most Singaporeans are open to the idea of homosexuality, but this 'fact' is hidden behind the facade of the law that may not be representative of what the majority of Singaporeans truly feel?
I am not trying to say which is the truth, but would just like for us to be critical and not take what we are told at face value. I am sure those who are educated will know that what the government or news reports tell us may or may not be the truth.

Look up reciprocal altruism, or read Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene. Basically, genes that promote altruistic behavior, especially towards that of close ones (parents, friends) or people who helped you are gradually passed down across generations and are naturally selected. Its pretty obvious - helping someone who has helped you before is beneficial in establishing a helpful mutual relationship. Saving your parents is more beneficial than a stranger because well, they are your parents! They raise you up, they provide care and nurture. But saving a stranger does not guarantee that he/she will help you back, or what if the stranger is evil? Most of the time, saving your parents provides more survival benefits, to put it crudely. Through a long period of natural selection, people with genes that generally favored helping their parents will tend to fare better than those who help strangers (you can think of many examples on your own why this would be the case)
You mentioned ""saving a stranger who we may have a relation with and pass down our genes"". What are you talking about? Someone whom you have a relation with is NOT a stranger. ""pass down our genes""? So you mean you share more genes with a stranger than your parents?

2006,2831,"To add on to #2816: If you really want to look at it from an evolutionary standpoint (and not a moralistic POV), you would save your parents because your offspring with your mother (yes I know it is morally wrong but hypothetically) will on average have 50 [your own genes] + (0.5 x 50) [since 50% of your mother genes are also your genes] = 75% genetic similarity; compared to an offspring with a complete stranger that will harbour only 50% of your genes.
Also, to those who are invoking the theory of evolution by NATURAL SELECTION to argue for or against LGBTQ issues, please note: In order to use natural selection as an explanation, there has to be a unit of selection (in this case a gay gene). Since so many opponents of LGBT have claimed that homosexuality is not natural (read: not genetic), it does not make sense to have an evolutionary argument. If homosexuality is as they said acquired, it should not be passed on to the next generation because of epigenetic reprogramming. Whether LGBTQ should have equal rights is completely up to debate (by the way I'm gay); the point of this is to tell you guys: if you guys want to use evolution to back up your arguments use the proper terms. I (metaphorically) get cancer every time I read badly-substantiated arguments.

2016,2841,"#2831 when i mentioned parents, I think perhaps it was not sufficiently clear. I assumed that our parents (mother) would not be able to reproduce.
Your claim that having offspring with your mother will help improve the chances of passing down ones genes is not wrong. But firstly, apart from simply passing down OUR genes, we do have to consider the viability of it. Our mothers advanced age would mean 1) highly unlikely to conceive 2) health risks 3) later age= higher risk of genetic defects in babies. Same goes for mating between siblings. There is a better chance, but with the greater risk of genetic defects, the baby may not live to pass on their genes to the next generations.
Evolutionary is not just our genes, but the genes of the human species as a whole. Crossing-over provides genetic variation, which will help to reduce the impact if a bottleneck situation occurs. Mating with others helps prevents a homogenous pool of genes (i forgot the correct term) but the idea is, it increases our chances of survival. The 'less of our genes' being passed on is outweighed by the greater chance of survival by our offspring.
Just to clarify, I don't believe in the evolutionary account against gay marriage (I support LGBTQA rights)

For social animals, there are various benefits of acting altruistically. Most important of all is that the debt will likely be repaid. Minor benefits include showing off to potential mates.
In humans, not saving parents causes emotional distress, loss of productivity within the family, shaming by society, etc. etc. That said, I can easily imagine situations where the choice of saving parents or saving unrelated strangers could go either way. Because the benefits differ in different circumstances, as well as different people place different values on things.

Seeing so many posts regarding legalising LGBT marriages in singapore have set me thinking about the society these days. Before I start proper, allow me to give my two cents worth about LGBTs. Well, I am straight but I truly respect the LGBTs right to love. However, affairs of the heart is extremely complex and most of the time many of us do not fully understand how to love or even what is love. In my opinion, legalising LGBT marriages isnt just about democratism, equality and the freedom to love, it is also closely tied to the traditional family structure in singapore. If legalising LGBT marriages really does happen then should polygamy be allowed too? How many are opened to the idea of polygamy? FYI, Polygamy is prohibited in singapore except for muslim marriages. Under Syariah law, a Muslim man may marry up to four wives at one time. - See more at: http://www.straitstimes.com/news/singapore/courts-crime/story/eight-questions-bigamy-singapore-answered-20141127#sthash.LOeDTtgs.dpuf (HEH! TALK ABOUT EQUALITY HAHAHA okay thats besides the point) Many kings in the past also practise polygamy and I am pretty sure humans are able to love (not to be confused with lust) more than one partner throughout our entire life. However, due to our societal restrictions we are restricted to having only one spouse. Okay dont get me wrong, I am definitely supportive of having only one spouse and being faithful to him/her, but i cant help but think about how similar these two deviant family structure are. Polygamy family structure could be functional and ""normal"" too. LGBT isnt ""wrong"", neither is polygamy , however these two just doesnt conform to our ""traditional family"" mindset which we are taught since young. They are grey areas that the singapore government is not willing to set foot into YET. Maybe its just me but my friends and peers my age are mostly understanding and accepting towards lesbians, bi and gays. I believe this is due to the education we received and i definitely agree that education liberates soceity. So good job to pink dot in educating the public about LGBTs and freedom to love, but sadly, like what Mr lee had said singapore is just not ready. Perhaps not in the near future, but maybe someday.

2699,3728,"To #3718, it's great that you're tolerant of LGBT relationships. From what I read, you seem to think that if LGBT relationships are allowed then polygamy might be allowed as well. This is a misconception. LGBTs do not consciously choose their sexuality like polygamous people consciously choose to have multiple partners. A man does not wake up one day and decides to like men instead of women. Sexuality is determined either genetically, or the environment the man grew up in moulds his sexuality. It's not a conscious choice. (Sidetrack: and that's why 377a and the non-legalisation of LGBT marriages are discriminatory practices, because sexuality, just like race and sex, is not choosable.) On the other hand it is definitely a conscious decision to have more than one spouse/partner. People are not born or raised to have no choice but to need like four wives or something.
As for whether polygamy is a functional family structure, that's debatable. Whether it's right or wrong? That's debatable too. But you shouldn't consider whether an LGBT family structure is right or wrong in the same way you consider for polygamy, because once again, LGBT isn't a choice, just like you wouldn't question whether being of a certain race is right or wrong. Finally, is the LGBT family structure functional? That's debatable too.

From a political and economic pov. Legalisation would mean housing/grants rights, protective rights, women's charter(?). To put it simply, its going to a hell of a journey.

""Black skin color"" seems like a pretty bad illustration.
But I get your point.
You can tolerate Christian/Islamic views and not agree with it. This is perfect logical in which yes everyone can concur to.
And with all due respect, you can tolerate LGBT behaviors but do not agree with it. Seems perfectly logical as well.
Below is part of one of our founding leader's opinion on racial cohesion.

""It's a hell of a journey yes, but something that needs to be done.""
This is rather subjective from different perspectives. I would not argue on this point to prevent from taking any form of stands.
""Just look at the Wear White campaign in response to the Pink Dot campaign. That is because they are ignorant of the points above. But I'm glad they are a dying breed and equality is winning.""
I do not think they are a significant majority of voice, probably as effective as making a post on social media.
I would not go on anymore but ""dying breed"" seems rather hateful.
Once again I re-iterate my key focus.
1. LGBT community is small but not to be overlooked.

Quoting your newly brought-up illustration, ""You can tolerate Christian/Islamic views and not agree with it,"" this is a bad illustration because you DO have a choice of religion. You can disagree with a different choice of religion made by others. My original illustration still stands. You do not have a choice of race, therefore you can't agree/disagree of a certain skin colour; you can't choose your sexuality therefore you can't agree/disagree of a certain sexuality.

I already agreed on this point on my very first post. I don't see why you pulling this back up brings us anything new across the table. And yes precisely why I quoted him.
When we're talking about tolerance, whether race(with reference to your case), we're are talking about the cultures and ideas these groups has. The reception of their actions to the rest of the community. Nothing on whether it is innate or a choice. It is the doings that matters. No one cares whether you are born blind/3 hands/wants to marries a dog, until their movements affects someone else.
""Choice"" was never our focal point. *back to my very first point which you quoted again which I still do not understand why when I mentioned I'm with you on that*
Example, Chinese Buddhist burn offerings during 7 month? Probably annoys some people, tolerance and compromise again.
This whole LGBT thing will go on for a long time. There is always going to be extremist on either sides. If you are not going to accept certain ideas from the opposing parties we will never be able to move forward.
If I may bring the focal back. We are talking about LGBT from a economic and political pov.
If you are going to ignore these 2 driving factors than I see no merits in having an academic discussion.
Gay/Traditional parenting in regards to children?
Its effects are still debatable and subjective.
Article was on actual views from people directly involved.
To add on, I didnt make a stand, why so defensive?(comment section)
I'm going to lay it as straight as possible. A huge number especially the 70s to 80s generation are largely misinformed or conservative on this topic. Until we choose to see whey they are coming from and then enlighten them, hate/non-acceptance is still going to continue. For example, an anti fb page with a significant number of followers which has active participation is on as we speak.

I am usually open minded listening to theological claims but when people use science willy-nilly I feel the urge to punch a duck.
This is a bold and untrue scientific claim. Science has not proven that there is no homosexuality in our genes. As for you ""theologically proven"", bringing this term into the game leaves no room for rational reasoning.
And I once again profess my disgust towards the convenient insertion of scientific claims in such arguments. Virgin birth, holy miracles, creationism etc. are all scientifically untrue. What then? Do theological explanations trumps science? If so, do not bring science into the picture in the first place. It is embarrassing to wield science as a weapon only when it agrees with your subscription of the Daily Bread.

Straight people have been able to marry since the beginning of.. marriage. So there we have it: the idea of marriage. So why can't LGBTs practice their idea of marriage too? Why is it against the law? This is when ""reception"" comes in right? I tolerate and agree with straight marriage. Even if I ""disagree, but just tolerate,"" I will still let them get married because it's none of my business. So why are a select group of people who disagree with LGBT marriage actively trying to prevent LGBT marriage from becoming legal? It's not even their business. If they're trying to uphold their values of traditional marriage, they are free to do so, but they simply cannot force others to accept their own idea of a traditional marriage. Just make LGBT marriage legal already. I have no idea why I'm the one who's forcing my idea of marriage onto the other camp, when it's clear the heteronormalists who say marriage must be strictly between a man and a woman, is imposing it on all of us by not supporting the legalisation of alternative forms of marriage.
On the other hand, your example of Chinese Buddhists' offerings burning has a negative effect on people who don't agree with it: the pollution. Now for the reception: people may disagree with it but still tolerate with this negative effect. Because it IS a choice to burn offerings near other people's houses, and it IS a choice to be Buddhist. Given the pollution generated, there is actually something to tolerate about. So yes, it is plausible to tolerate but still disagree. But you're using this example to support your argument that people can also tolerate but still disagree to LGBT marriage, which is invalid. Because what's there to tolerate about LGBT marriage? Since, as described above, LGBTs marrying is none of your business, what negative effect is there? Is it that the gay agenda will spread and distort your familial values? This is when the whole thing about LGBT not being a choice comes in! If you gay, you gay. If you straight, you straight. Your traditional familial values will not get eroded, unless your son dons an LGBT sexuality like an accessory, then it's right to tell him not to do that. You get to practice your traditional familial values. Now, give us the legal right to practice ours.
So there you go, politically we should legalise LGBT marriages. In fact so many developed countries have done it already, or are ready for it. As for the economic POV you mentioned, I'm not sure how sexuality affects the economy. So once again, Singapore is not ready for LGBT rights, notably the right to marry. But I hope we catch up soon.

8897,13028,"I agree with #13008, although for a different reason. The issue isn't really about sex, it's about what each of you want in the relationship. We all want different things, what you want may be different from what your partner wants. But more importantly, what you want now may conflict with what you want in the longer-term. For instance, wanting sexual pleasure now may come in the way of wanting a sustainable long-term meaningful relationship. May.
So it's about the relative importance you place on your current wants vs future wants vs partner. If you place so much importance on your current wants and your partner compromises, then all's good. But if your partner doesn't, then you have to weigh how important your wants are vs how important your partner is to you. If your current wants are so important that you would seek other means to fulfill them, then perhaps you guys are not suited for each other after all. Or put another way, since your partner views her wants as far more important than yours, then maybe you guys aren't suitable for each other.
Not saying either of you is ""wrong"" or anything, just saying that we all have to make decisions about what we feel is most important. If we can't find a compromise between conflicting desires or work things out, then maybe it's time to find someone else who has the same wants as you or is willing to compromise.

8904,13042,"To #12968: Yes, it’s definitely a lot more common than you think, and it’s fine to not know whether you’re compatible in bed before marriage. I don't know about you, but to me that’s not the most important thing to look for in a life partner. So think about what’s most important to you. You’ve been with this girl for over a year; how’s your compatibility like in terms of character, values, outlook on life, etc? Are you saying that if she was perfect for you in all these areas but wasn’t perfect in the sex department, or if she looked hideous naked (I would think most people look similar and just fine naked), you’d actually leave her?
Like others have mentioned, it’s impossible for most couples to be 100% sexually compatible from the get go. Have a read of accounts of people having sex for the first time after marriage (there are plenty on the net, just google) - couples who have been abstinent all the way until marriage are not going to be sex gods the first few times. I’m sure exceptions are out there, but we’re talking the majority. Most of the time it starts out awkward. It then gets better over time as you communicate and slowly “learn” how to have sex with each other. It sounds silly, but it’s really something most couples work through in a mutually loving and caring relationship. And it doesn’t have to start off as BAD sex; it can still be fun, because you’re exploring it for the first time with the person you love. It’s definitely still exciting and intimate. My point is - it’s a learning process, and that’s what relationships are about in the first place. You learn and adapt to each other’s preferences and needs in bed, just as you learn and adapt to all of each other’s non-sexual preferences and needs in life.
I say good on you for respecting your girlfriend’s choice to not have sex before marriage. Don’t be one of those guys who force their girls into doing it for their own gain - trust me, that’s not love. Love is respect, trust and communication. Definitely talk to your girlfriend, but understand that you’re not doing it to pressurise her into changing her mind if she’s firm in her values and beliefs. Talk to her because she’s your closest confidante, and because you’d like her to understand the struggles you’re going through, so that she can support you through it. Please seek proper help if you need to, or post anonymously on forums (and I mean legit forums dedicated to sexual health and things like that. NUSWhispers may not be the best place because some of the people here have given downright ridiculous advice) for advice on how to deal with sexual urges in an abstinent relationship, google for ideas, etc etc. There are more likeminded people out there than you think. It’s hard, but it can be done, and I speak from experience.
If you’re thinking about hooking up with girls or engaging “professional services” from the bad advice that someone else has posted, please for the love of god, DON’T. I cannot emphasise this enough. I don’t want to belittle your feelings for your girlfriend, but if you’re considering sleeping with other girls to satisfy your own needs and you’re actually prioritising that above the relationship with your girlfriend that has been built on trust and respect so far, then maybe you don’t love her enough. Please REALLY think about it long and hard. Yes, she may never find out. But what if she does? You’re about to destroy the girl you love with your own bare hands in the most brutal way ever. You’re about to take the trust that she’s given so wholly to you and trample all over it, because you selfishly love your own needs more than the relationship that you’ve been working so hard to protect over the past one year. Even if she never finds out, are you ready to live with the guilt for the rest of your life? Because this is cheating, period. You may think it won’t hurt her if you go behind her back and if she never finds out. But no, that does not make it any less wrong, hurtful or unethical. Your relationship (and subsequent marriage) would be one built on lies and deceit, not love and trust. Believe me OP, you’re better than that. Guard your relationship with your life. Don’t take chances, don’t take risks, and don’t underestimate your ability to hurt her as well as your relationship. One wrong step is enough to set off a lifetime of regrets. In short: If you love her, don’t do it. If you do it, leave her because she deserves better.
Lastly, it’s not embarrassing to be a virgin. Like someone else rightly said, it’s only as embarrassing as you choose it to be. And you most certainly do not need to keep your friends updated about your sex life. If you’re really embarrassed about being a virgin (I don’t know how your friends are like, but I understand that some less mature minds may deem it uncool/whatever), no one else has to know about it other than your girlfriend and yourself. You don’t need to confess to anyone about something so private and personal. Yes some guys brag about their sexual escapades, but you don’t have to be that kind of guy. I personally feel that those who don’t actually command a lot more respect.
I wish you the best of luck, OP. I’m sure she’s an amazing girl and I’m sure you love her. I understand that this is something very hard to deal with, but trust me, there are many success stories of abstinent relationships out there. Again, I speak from experience. I sincerely hope you make the right decision for yourself. Treasure your relationship, fight hard to protect it. Remember that she loves you and trusts you. Don’t, don’t, don’t break her heart.

8957,13106,"To #12968:
I am a girl, and because of an ex-boyfriend who kept pressurising me to have sex (but was unsuccessful; this constant pressurising was the reason why I called it off), I viewed my virginity lightly then, and even considered just giving it to him when I was still with him. His constant pressurising made it seem as though it was nothing much (which I believe that's the opinion of many - we all have the right to our own opinions).
It was only when I met my current boyfriend (after breaking up with my ex) that I was so relieved I kept my virginity, and I now see the value of it. I guess I can call myself a convert on this issue. A few days ago I literally looked down there (self sex ed lesson I guess - sorry if it's TMI), and I realised that I have never seen it properly before. It dawned on me how precious and private these parts are, and many of us (virginity believers or not) may not see the beauty of it. I feel that we should have more self-love, we're beautiful creatures. Treat yourself with care.
My current boyfriend is very conservative, and does not take kissing lightly as well, so I guess that also influenced me. I'm actually less conservative than him and has initiated things that he wasn't ready for yet. (Maybe my boyfriend is a special case)
But what my past relationship and my current relationship have taught me was that there's a reason why you should keep your virginity until marriage (but of course you really have to love the person when you decide to marry him/her, else, the marriage will probably fail). It is mainly because sex is an act of love, an act of the deepest connection you could ever have with someone, and you really want to do it with someone you love very much, because you will remember it forever.
While I have not lost my virginity yet, I lost my first kiss to my ex (and a couple of other acts), and from time to time I get reminded of it, and I regret it. In fact, sometimes I even feel disgust (obviously it didn't end well - I'm not speaking for those whose past relationships ended well) that it happened. I'm sure I will remember it forever, and regret it forever. My current boyfriend is an absolutely great guy, and I wished I never had these bad memories from my past relationship, and have saved it for him instead. Of course I can't undo these things I've done. Now I'm certainly saving my virginity for him on our wedding night (or if anything happens which I hope not, the next person I will love).
So, you will certainly remember your virgin experience as well. So are you sure you want to give this up to someone you may not be together forever/love forever? (not saying that marriage lasts forever either - that's why you really need to marry someone that you really love and can foresee yourselves building a life together) You are going to remember your first time forever (feel free to disagree with me on this). And what if... Just what if, it doesn't work out between you guys? You will bring this memory with you forever, and you just can't erase it, and this regret may follow you for a long time to come. If you can't bear this thought, don't create this memory.
And if after it falls apart you meet someone fabulous and someone you love even more than your previous, then now what? Whenever you both engage in sexual acts, you will always be reminded of your first time with someone else. At that point in time, would you have wished you have saved it for this perfect person instead? There's no ""start over"" then.
I have to stress that I'm not coming from a religious angle (sorry if the part on beautiful creatures seems so), and that I am a free-thinker. I'm just highlighting how because we always keep those parts private, we may not actively see the beauty of it, and how we should really let only someone we love very deeply handle it. We all have private parts, something that belongs only to ourselves - we're equal like that, I guess. Something we can truly call ""our own"". It should be something personal, something vulnerable, something you reveal to someone you really trust. This is something I really disliked about my ex - the fact that he's always so open to giving something so private to him to others and that he even influenced me to think like him.
I don't see how virginity should not be held onto even when someone is 24. Love yourself enough to acknowledge that your current relationship, no matter how great it is, may not be your last, and it is a risk to create a permanent memory of something that may be temporary. Choose wisely.
Believe me, I have seen virginity lightly before and I didn't realise how precious it could be. And now I do. To have a self sex-ed lesson only at 20 is a tad late, and I can already imagine how inexperienced I can be on my wedding night and just how much I really don't know about sex, but hey, I think it will be a sweet (albeit awkward) memory to learn along with your partner - it's going to be sweet if you guys really love each other.
PS. I'm sorry if this post has offended anyone (virginity believers or not/religious or not) - I certainly do not mean to, and I'm just sharing my thoughts and my own experience. Feel free to disagree, it's a free world.

This isn't really a response to the post, but I identify with OP fully. I feel like I am in the exact same situation as you, my ex pressured me a lot and my new/current boyfriend is more conservative and respects me way more. He treats me as if I'm really precious to him and he makes me feel very comfortable around him.
However, in my past relationship, my boyfriend used to force me to do things... I am a bit embarrassed to say this but let's just say that I gave him my body and everything but not my virginity. I'm so glad I didn't give him my virginity, but now I feel immense regret that I gave him all that.. I don't dare to tell my current bf about my past because it'll definitely change his impression of me. I want to keep it in too but sometimes I feel so much pain and anger with myself and I feel guilty for keeping secrets from my current bf. It's easy for people to say 'if he truly loves you, he'll accept you' but this is probably a big issue to him, as it is to me :( should I remain quiet about it? If he asks me about my past should I lie? (it could be a white lie..)

9020,13180,"Since we're on the sex before marriage issue, allow me to play devil's advocate and offer my extreme opinion:
I think the idea of saving your virginity until marriage is misguided. In fact, I'll even go as far as to say that it is unhealthy.
Mainly I feel that a girl should not be valued based on her virginity or her sex life. You never see guys worrying about saving their virginity until marriage (well actually you do, but much less), so why must girls be restricted to the same standards? This just perpetuates gender stereotypes in society and contributes to inequality.
To take things further, think about girls who have suffered sexual assault or rape. Does that mean they are of any less worth? I hope not. But such a societal attitude can only worsen the trauma experienced by these girls. Now, I am not saying that a change in opinion will make it any less painful for these victims, but it will certainly help in the recovery process to understand that there are things in life that matter more than virginity or sex.
Now. Let's take a look at your view. The main argument in the other side of the debate is that virginity is something you should save for the person you love/marry (hopefully the same person). And if not, you will be haunted by all the times you did ""it"" with other people..
Frankly.. it's just a circular argument, isn't it?
""Virginity is impt cos if u lose it u will regret it cos virginity is impt.""
I know I've probably trampled on the staunch beliefs and values of many out there. But think about it: where did these beliefs about premarital sex come from? Aren't these just social constructs passed down from generation to generation?

Well said. Then again, some girls love being 清高 by saying that they have saved it blablabla. Like as if it was such a big deal.
Its already the 20th century, who cares whether you saved it or not. People lead different lives so stop putting yourself at a high pedestal by saying ""oh im so ashamed but phew i didnt lose it, but i did other things"".
IMO, virginity is not only just about the hymen. If a girl has done any kind of sex e.g oral, heavy petting etc, you are already not a virgin.
Saving your hymen does not mean anything. At the same time, losing your hymen does not mean anything bad either. It just means that they have loved and lost, or that they love their current partner and want to take it to the next stage.
Sure, you should not pressure a girl to give you her first time, but if it happens, it will happen. Virginity is just a social construct to prevent people from overpopulating. Before such constructs, people married at age 15/16.
Nuff said.

Well the thing is, how physically closer can you be with someone other than sex? How more ""open"" emotionally and physically can you be?
Personally, I keep it because I believe that I want to share it only with one person whom I love and who loves me so much that we have promised to commit to each other through thick and thin to the end ( i'm one of those who do not believe in divorce). Why would I share a special moment with someone who does not reach that level of closeness? I think that kind of love that requires commitment deserves to be celebrated. Our culture often describes love as merely a feeling or emotion. I think love is more than that.
Also, even if the notion that ""sex/ vitginity is valuable"" is a social construct, so what? what's wrong with that?( I do not think it is, though, I think it is there for a reason) Why can't I keep some part of me special and reserved? A VIP room is special because people set aside a special area for special people, and only certain people can come in. It makes it special. Why can't we reserve sex for a special person who deserve it? Sure we can save other moments, i guess, though as of now i can't think of anything better.
Based on experience, I regretted that I kissed my ex. I shared a moment with someone that I barely talk to now. I do not regret it to the point that I see myself as not pure anymore etc etc or that it affects my self-esteem etc. Just that I wished I did not easily share that intimate moment with someone in the heat of the moment. Probably because I want to see it as more than just physical pleasure and I think it is an expression of love (and I think love requires commitment)
On the topic of rape, I agree that a raped woman is not of less value than a virgin. I know the pain and shame is extremely hard to bear with, but demeaning sex/ virginity is not the answer. Like, even children who do not even understand what sex means are traumatised by sexual abuse. Their tendency is to avoid the rapist. They sure do not like it. It is natural to feel sad/traumatised when you are sexually abused.
Just like when people are slashed, they bleed, they feel pain.
Would we say that ""it's okay,the cut will heal anyway "" and do nothing?
No, we should recognise that it is a painful experience and try as much as we can to heal them, though we cant do it completely. There will still be unsightly scars that make them want to hide at home
People who look down on the victims are like those who mock the slash victim because of the physical scars.
It is unsightly, maybe. We might have to admit that rape victims might have emotional scars that affects them.
Instead of dismissing their pain, we should show compassion, understanding and empathy. Each of us are broken in some ways anyway.

Thanks for sharing.
As much I would like to believe in true love.. it's really rare for people to find the one person that they love and for both of them to stick with each other for the rest of their lives.
Listen, you shouldn't regret that you kissed your ex. It doesn't make you any less of a woman (i assume) or a person. That is actually what I was trying to say.
I don't claim to understand love fully, but surely heat-of-the-moment, passionate love is also a form of true love. Furthermore, nobody loves perfectly from the beginning. It's only through failed experiences that you learn to love your final partner properly.
I certainly can't change how you personally feel about sex or intimacy. However, my point is that as a whole, this social construct that virginity is important is detrimental to how society values girls and how girls value themselves. And, like I said, it's really just a circular argument. A needlessly demeaning circular argument.

I am kinda in the same situation like you but in my case our roles switched. It's my boyfriend that went through the similar past that you shared about. However, sadly, his is worse. He gave his virginity to his ex too. He didn't want to tell me but, let's just cut it short, I found out about it. It was very very very, hurtful when I realised everything that he'd told me was a lie. To be fair, it was his past and I had no right to know if he didn't want to tell. However, now that I know about it already, the thoughts of him f**king his ex always appear out of no where and it's just freakin annoying. I honestly do not know when will all these thoughts stop coming to me. Maybe my whole life?
My suggestion is, if your bf asks, you shall not lie. But if he doesn't mention it at all, maybe he doesn't want to know it. In that case just let it go. But if you are planning to go far with him, I don't think there should be any secrets between a couple. So, just tell him. Though it will hurt like hell. But if he does truly loves you, he will stay. Just like how I'm still together with my bf after 2.5 years because I love him though his past won't stop haunting me.

Like the guy has to always accompany the shopaholic girl on her long shopping sprees, carrying all her bags, and just sitting in a corner in the store. Or like how the woman keeps talking but the guy has to just keep quiet and listen. Or like when the girl says something it's like a trap and the guy has to struggle with deciphering it.
I just wonder if there's any couple out there that really fits all these stereotype because these jokes are still funny to the people around me, and they keep saying stuff like that. Is this the norm?? I am evergreen clearly.
As a girl, I wouldn't want my boyfriend to carry all my shopping bags for me and sit down and wait for me for so long! He can totally go shop at some other place while waiting for me! And if I can't carry all my stuff, then um maybe I am over-shopping?? And if he really insists on waiting for me, then wouldn't it just be nice to reciprocate, i.e., accompany him to shop for what he likes?
And if the girl is always talking and expecting the guy to be obedient.. that's such a strange dynamic. Wouldn't the guy feel like he has no dignity? And I don't know how to expect my boyfriend to understand and interpret my feelings if I do it so vaguely (and sometimes I think girls do it intentionally).
I feel like it's a bit difficult to be the guy and unfair sometimes you know, if all these patterns of behaviour are indeed happening in reality. I'm not meninist, I just think that gender equality means exactly what it should mean - equality, not that women get to trample all over the men.

9729,14242,"#14241: I completely agree with you. I am an evergreen girl and I don't have any restrictions for a potential boyfriend such as looks, height etc. I just want a guy with a good personality, who loves me a lot, responsible and who will be financially stable in future.
I will not torture him by making him carry my shopping bags or make him wait for hours while I wear make up. I wouldn't mind helping him if he has a lot of things to carry. Because I believe in a relationship, we are equals. I will trust him and respect his freedom, allow him to go out with friends and have his own life, at the same time showering him with a lot of love and care.
I don't believe in gender stereotypes like guys always need to pay for dates and such stuff. I have done internships in the past and I hope to fulfil my career aspirations one day, so I would gladly pay for our dates to celebrate special occasions like his birthday.
Alas, I have been rejected more than once already. I don't know what's wrong with me. I guess I don't deserve to be loved. :'(

I don't need him to carry my shopping bags or wait hours for me while I dress up. When I'm out with him, I tend to avoid shopping or buying stuff for myself because I didn't want him to feel bored or wait for me while I shop for my own stuff. When we are out, we mostly go Dutch too and I dont expect him to pay for my meals. Sometimes when he pays for the meal I feel bad and I'll pay for the next one.
I also don't expect him to send me home because it would be so late by the time he reach home. I don't have any physical requirements as well, he was just average looking and 1.63 tall. i also tried to understand everything he likes like soccer, where I tried to remember all his favorite players names, timings of upcoming matches and I also took time to understand his field of work, which was an entirely different field from mine.
But after everything I've done, after all the effort put into the relationship, at the end of the day, I got dumped still. Lol

9775,14328,"OP of #14241 here. Glad that know many of us don't buy into stereotypical gender expectations! I know these stereotypes are jokes, and if people are laughing because the jokes are ridiculous, then it's great. The scarier part is the insidious effect of these jokes perpetuating certain ideas in people's subconscious. Jokes draw upon existing discourses, and people laugh because they can relate to those ideas. There's also a fine line between being funny and offensive. But anyway, not trying to be so picky about this because I do (want) to have a sense of humour, haha.
I am posting again because a commenter made an interesting point, and I'm bored and like to discuss issues like this with a community out there. I won't do this again so sorry if you totally hate this!
The commenter said that I'm only saying all that because I'm evergreen /single and implied that I may change once I get attached. If he meant it as a joke, sure! But well.. my kind of over-active brain likes to make connections and explore different thoughts, so after a while I was thinking... yeah I really don't know how I'd act after I get into a r/s, when the novelty and romance has worn off. I may act in the very same way that I said I wouldn't. This happened some couples I know, after they starting getting used to and comfortable with each other.
We don't really know how we'd become in hypothetical situations. But one way that may be a useful indicator is to see how you act around people that you are familiar with, e.g. family, relatives, friends, or around people that you don't really like. Do you take it for granted that the people around you have to serve your interests? Do you expect them to? Or are you thankful when people do stuff for you. I have friends who make their parents bring stuff for them to campus, and they don't feel bad about it or aren't thankful about it. Or like they ask their parents ""eh mum can you faster wash my clothes cos I want to wear them later"".
I'm always a bit cynical about love and romance because when the novelty wears off, then we show our true colours and then you realise that you got yourself into something you didn't expect or imagine initially. A true indicator of the person's character is how he/she acts around people they are used to or don't really like, not how he/she acts around you in the most romantic and novel stage of the relationship. Just a point of reflection for myself.

9942,14580,"General Tips for lovelorn NUS guys: One of the more constant type of posts I see here is the sad rejected guy lamenting his unjust deprivation of love by enigmatic women who appear to be equally interested in the guy, only to confine him cruelly in the friend-zone when he confesses. The outcome is painful for both parties (and for me to see such unnecessary emotional hurt), but it can be avoided. Here are some tips from bro to bros (ladies feel free to constructively criticise)
1. Pre-First-Date Confessions are for the movies and serials. They don't belong to real life dating.
movies: [attraction] -> [interaction] -> [confession] -> [first date] -> [happily ever after]
real life: [attraction] -> [interaction] -> [ask on a date] -> [first date] -> [many more dates] -> [confession/ ""the Talk""] -> [exclusivity]
2. Be honest of your intentions, don't pretend to be just a friend
instead of asking ambiguously ""wanna hang out/ eat dinner?"" like any of her other platonic friends might do, make it clear that you are not looking to just 'be a friend' if that truly is the case. Don't waste her time by acting like a friend when your ""friendship"" would crumble without promises of romance. But of course, ""making it clear"" does not mean ""I love you and I want you to have my babies"" confession style...
""If you're not already attached, could I take you out to dinner sometime?""
This makes your intentions very clear, without being too direct and pressuring. (usually... see point 4)
3. Accept Rejection like a Gentleman
Another lie we are fed by movies and serials is that a man's effort (despite his initial unattractiveness to the woman) should always be rewarded by a woman's affections eventually. Misogynist bullshit. It's ultimately her decision, and if she says no, stop bothering her and move on.
And no, this is not because its some sneaky way to gain her respect and admiration in the hopes of asking her out again. It is because you respect her decision. Period.
4. Women are not like standardised locks to be picked with a secret manual
One of my close female friends prefers to be strictly platonic friends for months before any romantic hints and doesn't like the pressure of going on on ""official dates"" even with guys she finds attractive. For every 10 girls harassed by suitors and stalkers, 1 girl would find her true love in a guy who persistently chased her despite rejection for a year. Each individual is different, and these tips, while applying to most people, are not laws or rules that apply to all people. Keep an open mind.
Good luck,

10030,14715,"After reading the post #14580 and #14590, I can’t help but give you guys a heads up about rejection, coming from girls who think like me. Just a perspective; I have quite a few guys chasing me before, and have dated before too.
When talk about BGR thing, I have a “reject-first-then-observe” rule for a few reasons, incld guys I’m initially attracted to. It’s bcos guys who chased me are those I don’t know super well (and I think this is the main reason why most girls would reject guys also). I hang out with my female-only kakis most of the time. And I don’t believe in platonic friendship, one party is bound to fall for another I believe (feel free to disagree though, it’s just my opinion). You have to see a person through their ups and downs in order to really know them, and not just based on the previous moments when they behave themselves around you just so that you would be attracted to their good-boy/girl front. There was once I rejected one and woah once we resume as frens, all the pattern chut lai/come out already sia (walao, I felt like I kena cheated). That’s when I know that that guy is not for me. I doubt people can put up a front for long. It takes only time for you start seeing their true nature.
Next, I have to agree with OP of #14580. If guys can handle it like a gentlemen, woah I think I will end up chasing him back lehhh..! Mainly bcos I found that very mature, which I find very attractive *gasp*. Handle it in a way that the friendship is not affected in any way, that you don’t resent her for rejecting you after all that you did to chase her (that you worked on your body or your looks etc.). It’s ok to be affected, after all, it’s like a failure after putting in so much effort and it seems like it is all for nothing. For one, the girl didn’t ask for any of it. Take your time to recover from it. Handle it with maturity (ie BE A MAN; most girls like men, not boys); everyone has a choice, and respect her decision that maybe it’s just not the right time for her, maybe she just hopes that you’d improve in other aspects like your character, or maybe she still have someone else in mind (in that case you suay lor, or you can give her time you know), or maybe she wants to date after graduation, that’s all. Rejection is a good thing in a way, at least you know she’s not toying with you or your feelings and just to fill her boredom temporarily. One of my kakis she will just date any guys (with acceptable standards) who chased her just bcos she pity them and she feel bad for not giving any chance. Btw she's a chiobu and Ms Popular, more chio than me. Eventually she’ll initiate the break up and jump to the next relationship (she’s heartless that way). Time will tell if the you guys are really into the girl and vice versa, or it was simply a temporal attraction. For the latter, rejection is still the better decision imo. If feelings are true, I hope you guys will not give up chasing bcos...just maybe, she hopes that you would ask her out again (UNLESS she tells you directly the first time that she’s not into you at all, then I think chasing her again might just turn her off hur hur). Trust me, the efforts put into chasing her is not for nothing. Perhaps she hopes for other changes as well, not just the physical. Relationships aren’t easy; couples do fight quite a bit (don’t fool yourself with K-dramas/Disney love stories); it ranges from some jealous third party, work stress, boredom, family problems, her PMS, differences in expectations and so on. If guys can’t even handle a rejection, I don’t know how they’re going to handle all that is to come.
One of the rules when comes to dating: don’t expect your partner to “make you whole” or to handle some aspects of your life which you can’t handle yourself. In other words, if you can’t handle loneliness yourself/just want to tell the world that you got girlfren (that you are desirable too)/just want to have fun/stop being an evergreen, I think the relationship might not end off too well (again, just my opinion, feel free to disagree). Sometimes people want to fall in love for all the wrong reasons. I learnt from NUS how to be happy and alone sometimes when your kakis aren’t ard: to eat, to attend lectures, to survive a difficult module on my own. It’s not easy, definitely. I do fall into mild depression that the world/life in NUS is just too cruel. But it takes time to see it otherwise although reality is that no one is going to be there for you every single time. But friends are out there, gotta make an effort to meet them you know. At work, one is bound to meet a bitch (unless you super heng). Sometimes in a relationship, you’ll realize that you feel alone even with that someone. Somehow you guys just can't click/talk things through. So my advice is to learn to be more independent first, else you might end up pestering/clinging to your partner a lot (this will suffocate them and tire them out eventually). That you’re okay being single, but you’re happier being in a relationship. I hope my words shed some light to those who are wondering about the things I’ve mentioned. Of course, I’m just speaking from my point of view, every girl is different. There are those like me, just as there are those like my chiobu kaki, just as there are those who have no idea who they really want HAHA. My Singlish not super fluent lah, sorry it’s not as funny as #laoniang or #laobu story.
ps. I hope #laobu will update soon.

10044,14732,"Hey #14715, using rejection as a measure of a man's maturity is at best; a one-sided view of maturity and at worst; naive on both sides.
One-sided because maturity is more than 'accepting it like a man'. It's about responsibility (my Ma taught me that). I'm responsible for my studies, my actions and my own happiness.
I consider myself a mature guy. I put effort into thinking of original jokes and make her happy in the messages. I prepped my first date with small gifts and gestures. If she rejects me, I accept it and move on. I don't see the point of attempting to start random convos and annoy her just to prove the 'feelings are true'.
Yes, some guys aren't worth your time and will show their pattern after rejection. But rejection is a blind trap and will also hurt the rare species. Perhaps even more so since they will keep trying. If the trapper expects loyalty from the victim. I think that's pretty naive as well.

10050,14741,"In response to #14715, I think the reject-first-then-observe method is okay for the women but I think it's super cruel to the guys, don't you think! (I am a female here by the way.)
Because rejection hurts like crap. Maybe it's just me but I would feel really bad to reject a guy and then accept him again/chase him back later? Or maybe by ""reject"" OP means to tell the guy that we can be friends first or something?
This grey zone between being single and becoming an official couple is so complex. My theory is that there are two main groups of people: outgoing and reserved. The outgoing ones dare to date people they are attracted to even if they don't know them that well, and if it works, it works; if it doesn't, then it's okay and it ends there. Consequently these people are more social, and able to manage different situations, and are more experienced in dating and socialising with romantic intentions. This way makes sense because you are open to different individuals and have a lot of chances to test water and get to know people. For people like this, it's probably okay to go up to them and indicate interest right away.
Then there is the other group who is reserved, but will totally devote a lot into one dating relationship when it actually happens. They date people with a long-term view, so in a sense they are quite picky. Contrary to the first group, I think this group rarely gets a chance to know a large number of people because they don't date a lot of people and don't respond to indications of interest at first sight. So if someone you like belongs to this group, it's better to be friends for a while, try to control the romantic feelings and focus on understanding who the person is. After being friends for a long time, and seeing what the other person is like, you can reevaluate.

10072,14763,"Well well hello #14732,
the first time I read your response I’m like “woah gong simi”. your english very good, I like. “Mature”, “original jokes” and prep “small gifts”, woah seh, date me maybe? JOKING lah hahaa.
On a serious note, I do see your point. Naive perhaps. Or you can say I’m playing hard to get, but then this is not really the case. Of course my rule doesn’t apply to every men, and maybe I have sent the wrong signal to fellow friends who are thinking of applying my technique of “reject-first-then-observe”. By “observing”, I mean to still be friends and get to know the person better. The thing is, how about “rejection” after dating then (ie get dumped eventually)? My chiobu hedonist kaki will tell you ""never mind"", and would just date anyway, which I find unfair to the one “hunting"" while she’s the one calling the shot.
Essentially, we don’t want to reject the wrong species, don’t want to NOT reject the wrong species (double negation, ie we want to reject the wrong species), we don’t want to date out of pity (ie just date lahh) and so on. So how sia??? Cannot this cannot that. Well, I guess the answer to “reject or don’t reject” is “it depends” lor. It depends on who the girl is looking for in the first place. If I want a guy with mature thinking, and someone whom I don’t know very well appears to be quite mature, then I really don’t mind trying out a few dates. If he’s a little childish to begin with (or “seems"" to just want to get out of the evergreen circle, or he “seems” to just want to have some fun etc), I’ll apply my rule. This is just me lah hor. After all, who we think we like may not be complete after all. We may be attracted to someone with traits we didn't know we like. We all have different taste in men/women, so there’s really no fixed rule. And after observing I find that the guy is really really not bad, I think I’ll be the one chasing him. Not hoping that he’s still loyal and whatnot, but a sincere attraction.

10106,14819,"More thoughts on rejection.
Rejection elicits disappointment. Disappointment breeds doubt. Doubt inspires change. I think the kind of change that happens varies widely. Rejection need not always be cruel if you can clarify the doubt. Be it no chemistry, no clubbers or no whatever. If you let his imagination run wild I think its even more cruel and simply mind-f him. Usually the guy will understand one laaa. (If not even close enough to discuss this then gg lor)
Personally, over time, I'm less and less disappointed. Maybe because I think I tried my best. Or maybe, like what my friend says, liking a girl is ultimately a small thing.
And justsayin #14741, I have a similar theory on relationships as well.

I do not wish to have your face to read as you listen but do not hear, as your face remains impassive even as my heart tears into a million pieces. I shy away because I know that you will never quite react the way I wish you would, because I doubt, and I believe that you are not in this the same way that I am, because you had shown once, twice, no, many times before, that you are not here with me.

12136,17534,"I have to confess. I'm very needy and get emotionally attached easily. It's been like this since I was a teenager and had a really bad experience. If I've been texting a guy for some time, and suddenly he stops talking to me or takes longer to reply, I get really upset and hurt, even if I don't like the guy. I'm afraid of developing such relationships because I don't want to be used to getting messages from someone. Recently, I met a guy and we've been texting day and night but now he doesn't bother replying sometimes. He previously initiated all our conversations, so I kinda got used to receiving texts from him everyday. Now I actually feel extremely disappointed when I look at my phone and see that I haven't received a message. I know it's really stupid and obsessive of me to be like this, but I have no idea how to get rid of such feelings. I'm quite introverted and it takes a long time for me to open up to someone and equally long to get over such 'almost relationships'. Any suggestions?

12137,17535,"#17497 You've said something I've been saying and want to say now. Effective communication. Maybe you know who I am in real life. Maybe. After all, what's in front of me is only a screen.
Here's how I think the text kills:
1) Face-to-face interaction (FTF): There's a face attached to the conversation.
Text: In the worst case scenarios, there isn't, but in some, there is.
Note: You want to know who you're talking to and not have to guess although you may get it 9/10 times right. Unless you are wanting to talk to a random stranger. Things don't get pretty even if that's 1/10 time when you don't be skeptical and commit to the person's identity together with what he or she has said.
2) FTF: There's speech, and with that comes tone
Text: There's no speech, no tone, but only words.
Note: Tone plays a very important part in conversations. Someone with the same words can have a straight face, be smiling, or be angry. Tone helps us understand the other party's mood, and hence, their attitude towards us. Their attitude towards us helps us understand the intention behind their words and the meaning of those words. What do you get from text? The best you get is emojis and maybe a few gifs, and I think we all know not to trust those. To be sure, people fake their tones in FTF interactions as well, but those are less common and you get to cross-check with other cues being presented. Also, words help us to read mood as well, but in this aspect, FTF interaction is way better than texts where correct words are less readily chosen (keep one's sensitivity constant).
3) FTF: There's body language, including facial expressions.
Text: There isn't body language.
Note: The cues we get from body language is somewhat different from tones but they ultimately help us comprehend the meaning behind those words. It's one of those factors that help you cross-check with the information you get from tones of speech. Not just that, but the actions themselves convey meaning. Again, they're all subjected to misinterpretation and false signals. But even if you are talking to a well-trained evil doer and you are extremely bad at picking up cues from body language, I'm sure FTF interactions do better than texts (no body language), most of the time anyway.
4) FTF: Instantaneous.
Text: Not instantaneous.
Note: Texts are not instantaneous, although the technology might be. That's why you have people, me included, who reply at a later time. Some because they are busy or because they want to spend more time with a better crafted message, or for some other reasons. And there's nothing wrong with the latter, just as some people prefer to make sure that their words are appropriate in the context they're in before they speak. But what happens in the interval for the party waiting to receive a reply? Thoughts start to wonder (constantly check your phone for new messages is a sign), and that's bad if you commit to your thoughts. This is detrimental in several ways, especially emotionally. I've been there. That's just one aspect of spontaneity. I think most people find that overall, texting is extremely tiring or at least more tiring than just talking, and needless to say, things get worse for texts. How many people actually prefer sending and reading huge chunk of texts? Another pro of spontaneity is that everything gets cleared up on the spot. Anything that you don't understand about what the other party is saying or has said, or events that are occurring or has occurred gets clarified readily. More understanding and less ""unnecessary"" thoughts, and whatever that leads after.
With technology, there are always better alternatives than texts, than the worst kind of texts, besides FTF interactions. There may be various reasons especially in our hectic life that we have to do less with FTF interactions, but my thoughts are that, always try to get the best form of communication. This applies regardless of whether or not there's a conflict. Worse yet is when there isn't a clear understanding of what kind of person the other party is and all the cons of texts that has been mentioned above gets amplified.
That's what I can come up with for now. Maybe there's a better guide out there online and if that's the case, sorry for wasting your time. Maybe readers just think I'm an a**hole but that's not important now. Thanks for reading this and best wishes to everyone.

12149,17556,"#17534: Read the post after you, #17535 and chuck your phone into the nearest recycling bin for electronics. Just kidding.. The only way to change yourself or anything about your lifestyle is to develop habits and you definitely want healthy habits.
1. You need to start telling yourself that you're not stupid or obsessive. Everyone has so called ""issues"" or basically parts they don't like about themselves. Your psych affects you in many more ways than you think. There are probably people who develop the habit of going to the mirror daily once awake and say to themselves, ""I'm amazing.""
2. I'm not sure in the long run, but in the short run, you definitely can't manage it. You need to use texts only for short conversations, i.e. arrange meet up, get quick information. Given how much of a huge role your phone plays in your life, it's likely you'll lack self-control for the habit formation or following or just not looking at your phone. You may need to just leave your phone at home, or turn the services off in a way that's hard to reactivate, or the like (these are habits too).
3. For the needy and emotionally attached easily part, it's unlikely the NUSWhispers community can help you. Understand yourself better through some good online psychology articles? Also, it might help to get some long-term/observant friends to point out some other noticeable traits to you. There might be more that has gone past your attention. Just saying. Habits wise, you can try the online ones as well.
4. For how to get over someone part, again, I would think online articles for what habits to develop? It probably involves some happiness and lifting of moods. You can try taking a 10 min walk around your neighbourhood every morning for fresh air, get a plant on your table or the like? Yoga? Breathing exercises?
Basically the process is simple. For the most part, you have already identified the problem and what you want to change (keep at the reflections). It's just figuring out how to affect that change. Online suggestions of what habits to form and maintain are just starters and each individual is different. You can also come up with your own habits and experiment with them. If I told anyone my habits, they will go O_O. Even lacking self-control for all these habit formation or following can be a problem in itself and you can think of and develop habits to correct that.

Thank you so much, #17556, that was really encouraging and useful :)
Um as for the commentator, I guess you assumed that all I did was texting because that was all I mentioned. Actually I hang out a lot with that guy a lot since we're coursemates. I never intended to have a relationship with him. It's just that I've been too used to having someone to tell stuff to, to share a funny vid with, etc. And now when I initiate convos, he barely replies though I know he's texting other girls at the same time. I feel really hurt and humiliated even though he's just a friend.
And my insecurity doesn't have to do with the fact that most guys are creepy and gross...it's being afraid of being too emotionally reliant on another person.

12197,17617,"*Just my personal opinion & experience*
If my assumptions are right, since you say that you're introverted (whatever the hell that means;pet peeve) and get attached easily, chances are you're treating each and every relationship very seriously, and so you open up yourself (and therefore the quick emotional attachment) and bring that person into your life. It's basically very similar to a kid making his/her first friends. So the dependency is natural.
There isn't anything good or bad about this; just happens to be that way. There will come a point at which there are enough people to 'hurt' you so that you stop being so quick to share your world with another. Of course if there isn't it's a blessing.
P.S. I don't think calling guys creepy and gross is any good way to ask for help

1. I wasn't saying that most guys creepy and gross. This was the opinion of a random commentator. I was trying to say that that wasn't even my concern, whether it is true or false.
2. I agree that dependency to a certain extent is natural. I was referring to being overly emotionally reliant. I don't think that is healthy or 'natural', and I find it hard to extricate myself from almost relationships easily. Thus I try to guard against being emotionally dependent on another person, but I don't know how to change how I feel. Being easily dependent and being 'so quick to share [my] world' with another are not synonymous. The latter can be controlled, the former not as easily so.
3. While I agree that introversion is used far too often than necessary, I find your dismissal attitude towards introversion ignorant and bigoted.

Maybe I should have made it clearer that I'm speaking from *experience* i.e. I used to be like you, maybe still am. For the sharing part, I meant that you automatically include that person in your daily activities (if possible), your thoughts, your feelings etc, not a verbal account of what you consciously choose to let that person know. Or am I getting this wrong again?
Actually now I think about it can you maybe try to qualify what do you think is 'natural' vs 'over reliant'? What I was saying that your dependency will eventually reach 'natural' levels after you experience this kind of thing over and over again.

Have no clue why you're so outraged regarding my attitude (which isn't dismissal BTW) towards introversion. Basically I dislike other labels too (e.g. Nerds, Gays, etc) cause I think they very much limit one's/others' understanding about an individual. Why let a stereotype define yourself? Of course you won't let yourself be entirely contained by that, but it sets a limiter somehow, or at least that's how I feel, ok?

I don't know what you're majoring, but from my own experience, if you're in FASS, you're in luck. It isn't hard to maintain a CAP of 3.5 (that's a flat B grade). If you are of average calibre (and that applies to most scholars because everyone in NUS is very smart), you would have no problem bagging a B by just attending lectures. With some effort at some readings, you could get a B+. Getting an A- is almost defacto with some sustained effort while getting an A requires you to really understand the module requirements. What are the learning objectives your prof really wants you to have? What skills should you have honned and demonstrated? Don't get too caught up with your own points, always harken back to the lecture slides.
No matter what you're majoring in, you're at the start of a long (and painful) but very fruitful process of growth and discovery! Your post makes me reminisce my own first sem in which I was very worried too but I ended up okay. (You will come to realise in NUS that ""okay"" means ""A-"", which is ""not bad"" actually).

You know what, not being able to secure scholarship for an international student like me, whose household income is about $2000 per month is suicidal. FYI, the tuition fee for international students is about $18k per year(subsidised).
Failing to secure scholarship meaning I will need to pay back all the fees to NUS in one lump sum. And I am not the only one who is liable for paying it, my parents too are.
Just imagine the responsibility, the burden... How can someone not worry about it?
I know it is great to be able to get a scholarship to study here in NUS, I deeply appreciate that. But it is hard for me to ignore what the consequences it may bring if I fail to score 3.5 and above.

Don't worry so much first. 3.5 means you just need to get straight Bs, which, really, isn't very tough unless you have modules which are extremely difficult or you just happen to be unable to do that very well.

(I have graduated)
I felt the same unfairness when I was in NUS. It is always frustrating to see the ""scholars"" making a less than average grade (@#40471, #40438: 3.5 is a little lower than the mean of CAPs in NUS. If you can't even get that effortlessly, you don't deserve a single cent of our taxpayers' money) while you slog your ass off to get that coveted FCH, pay for your tuition and work for your own allowances.
NUS (and probably SIngapore, if we want to expand to talk about foreigner scholarships; but that is a different issue) should probably change the way scholarships are administered. A minimum CAP of 4.2 (I wanted to say 4.5, but thought of giving some buffer for one or two bad semesters) should be mandatory. To those that say that this is too stringent, consider the fact that the local AStar scholarship has the same requirement anyway. Another change could be to establish scholarships to be expired yearly. That is, a new candidate is to be selected every year.
We can't change the system but we can change ourselves. I would advice you to continue to improve yourself both academically and professionally. Show NUS that they made a mistake denying your applications. The best revenge I had was to do well and yet turn down NUS when it wants me to make me a poster boy for recruitment publicity ads in ST. My reply was ""Why ask me when NUS doesn't deem me to be good enough? NUS should get its scholars instead"". (*pixelated sunglasses falls slowly*)
Fast-forward to today; I am doing my graduate studies in the top university in the world. If I ever made it big in the future, I would gladly donate my money to this alma mater instead of NUS. Remember, he who laughs last, laughs longest. :)

I am also in a selective, competitive faculty situated at a different campus in Law. Many of my classmates are from families of lawyers. They are just snobbish by nature. Not deliberate but it's just how they are like without realizing toward me.
Also I must say they don't feel the stress like I (from a middle income HDB family) face daily; The need to get a part time job, pay off my school fee loan etc. They can simply make a call and an internship/ training contract will be waiting for them.
Sure some can take on CCA or goes for moots trainings but they have the time to do all these while I have to get a part time job outside. And recently I find it so sad that there are even fellow classmates posted comments criticizing someone who failed to get Training contract as he/she didn't put in effort to boost cca. I was like what the shit la, you don't even know his/her circumstances yet you condemn so quickly instead of offering words of comfort.
These rich well to do family students Even if they fail to perform, they can simply restart elsewhere when they graduate such as asking parents for money to open business, restaurants, cafes. , they will just rebrand themselves and say that they ""found their passion outside law"".
Well, what the f**k right? That's just some of the numerous advantages that being born in a rich family bring you.
My advice is: if you are not rich, please do not do law. It is naive to think that law studies can bring you good career. If you are poor, you lack social capital from your family such as networks connection. In short, you lose out to others badly from the very first day you start law school.

I am also a law student from a middle income family studying law. I agree that a number of law students are very rich and do not see the problems that people like us face. Many drive their own cars and the proportion is much higher compared to other faculties. That being said, I do know several people who also live in HDB flats and work part time. Maybe its simply that the richer people are more high profile?
In contrast to OP, I would actually encourage poor / middle income students to study law if you can. Yes, it is difficult, and yes, its one of the places you can see most obviously how rich people get it really easy and take shortcuts. It can be very demoralizing.
But I also feel law one of the places poor people have the most opportunity to make a life for themselves and in turn get successful, well paying careers. This is because the law industry may provide advantages to rich people, but it doesn't discriminate or have high entry barriers for the less wealthy.
(1) Grades here have a strong correlation to hard work in law school. Rich people have no shortcuts for this. And FCH opens all doors to every major law firm for you whether you are rich or poor.
(2) Even though you start out with no connections, you can make your own connections by impressing internship bosses and professors. Professors are very kind to students and there is a lot of interaction with them, which in turn leads to more opportunities. Everyone you meet in law school tends to be somebody big. You just need to be thick skinned a bit of luck to have one meet you and like you.
(3) It is true that a lot harder to get internships and TCs without connections. But it is still possible as the big firms takes hoards of interns. And once you get an internship, you can impress by working till midnight everyday and doing as much work as you possibly can. Bosses actually see this and give recognition to your efforts. It doesn't feel like nobody notices. Unfortunately, during these lowly paid internships you can't earn money from part-time jobs as youre working every second, but its a short term loss for longer term rewards. Just need to suffer for a few months.
(4) Financial aid is very generous and available as all the rich students do not apply for funding so there's more for you. This applies to school fees, but moot competitions and other programmes can be subsidised too.
(5) When you start work the main measure of your professional success is billable hours. Just slave your life away and sell your soul and you will be rewarded.
It is tough (but what isn't?) and sometimes you need a little luck to meet somebody or be put in a department for internship where someone just happens to resign. But there is a path up. The wealth would help but its not a prerequisite to anything, and you have the chance to prove yourself. Thats why so many lawyers are unfeeling and near sociopathic because they work crazy hard and you are rewarded with very attractive remuneration. Its not the life for everyone, but if you are poor / middle class and want to be rich, its one of the places you can try.

26163,41045,"#40994 you are absolutely right. In this world, to have an easy life you must be
1) be average and born in the right family, or
2) be damn good if you born in a poor family, or
3) even you are good, being born in a gd family helps still.
If you are average and born in a poor family, life is hard. While you may think that just by entering law or med sch makes you good, but no, you are just one of the many. Not good enough. Since you are just average, and parents arent rich and are unable to pull strings, you just gotta slog for the rest of your life. You may be envious that your classmates have cars and nice holidays, good food, parties, can go on exchange while you stay in singapore and teach tuition, some times even compromising your grades. You may even think that graduation will even the playing field. No it doesnt. In a few years time, they will marry early and get their parent-sponsored condo early. On the other hand, you might have difficulty affording even a hdb downpayment because of tuition loan. Their parental connections will thrust them into coveted training contracts and retention, or juicy residencies. While you will be out there, fending for yourself alone. After a while you will get used to it. Envy isnt going to help. You must either convince yourself that money isnt that impt or find meaning in other parts of your life. Harping about the so called unfairness isnt going to help. The truth is that in terms of educational opportunities you are really blessed on a global scale. I was once very envious, it seems that the rest of the world has everything and i have none. But such thinking only brings misery. You must find joy not only in materials goods. There are a lot of poorer people than you. And they live their lives meaningfully. The thing about the social class disparity and envy is that you cant even really openly tell your classmates what you honestly feel. Like seriously you think they are really undeserving of what they have. A lot of people may find you self entitled, but i believe most people that comes from poor family who get a place in university will experience an ""ah ha"" moment. The moment when you realised how rich your classmates are, and how their lives seem so perfect. Suddenly all the teachings in primary school about studying hard, and being able earn a good income falls apart. There will be resentment against your lot in life, in some cases even resentment at parents. Throughout ages, people have tried to explain via religions. Hindus and Buddhists proably think you sinned a lot in the previous life, and deserve your fate. Christians and Muslims try to look to the afterlife. Communists dont believe any of it, and goes for extreme redistribution. The truth is in every capitalistic society, bottom 30-40% are going to suffer. But capitalism is efficient, incentivise people to work hard. It benefits the nation greatly even there is an entrechment of the elite. The bottom gets very envious. But extreme poverty is rare. No one starve to death. If a nation is sufficiently hardworking enough, trade makes it rich. Like the case of china. In thirty years time, china became a global leader after ditching socialist economics. But the poor in china feels more unhappy. Thirty years ago things were simpler, especially when the distribution of wealth is more equal then. Now it is very skewed. But the rich are very rich and nation is strong.
You just gotta work hard, do your best in law sch, hope for a training contract, and hope things go for the better. The world will revolve still. I know whatever i say, you will still find social mobility a hoax and the american dream is just a dream (yes it is indeed a dream, even in america). But with some luck, we hope that our lives can be better. Even if it doesnt get better, honestly if you look on a global scale it is already very good. That we should count our blessings. But our classmates lifestyle may skew our perception of what is normal. i think life has never been easy. Channel your envy into hardwork, and try to help others, that you may find meaning in life. Life should not just be able material comforts. I hope your you will find your future career meaningful and challenging in whatever you do. I cannot offer you a good explanation for your predicament, that why your classmates life seem so great but yours sucks at this point in time. For all you know, their lives may really be that great. :) But this is not about them but about you. According to victor franzl the meaning of life is to... FIND the meaning of life... Rather circular at first but gradually you realise this life is yours. It is what you want it to be! You have the freedom to make the life meaningful for your next sixty years. community service. Thousands of things you can do in the years to come. Harping about your ""poverty"" is not going to help, makes you very bitter, and is exhausting. I was once there. I wished you the best and hope you make best use of all opportunities available to you.

RE: Letter to law school students who are not rich
Yes, the large majority of the law school population tend to be affluent. Yes many of them tend to drive expensive cars to school - Mercedes, BMWs, Porsches. Many of them (or rather their parents/relatives) have connections with partners in major law firms in Singapore. Yes, they tend to have it easier. It will be a lie, or maybe simple ignorant, for them or anyone else to say otherwise.
And yet, to whoever that's feeling bitter, unhappy, or feel that the situation is unfair, please take comfort in the fact that you do have other comrades in school who also do not come from rich/affluent families. I come from a lower-middle income family; I take student loans to cover my school fees and living expense; I apply for bursaries and financial aid; I teach tuition and try to work during the holidays. Sometimes I do resent the fact that I don't have the things my friends do, but we can't always demand to live the lives we want; we do our best with the hands we are dealt with.
And this brings me to the next point. If we look at things with a broader perspective, we should be glad of where we actually are now. Of the billions and billions of people in the world, we are living in stable and prosperous Singapore. The the millions and millions in Singapore, we are living among those who are healthy. Among the tens of thousands in their 20s in Singapore, we are living among those who are privileged enough to attend university. And among the thousands and thousands in university, we are among those privileged to be in the highly selective law faculty. I do not believe that life is always about comparison because the pessimist will always feel that they are inadequate, and the optimist will always feel that they are too good and will slacken; I believe that life is about being happy with where you are and the little things in life. But nevertheless, I think a comparison in this context is important for all of us 'poor law-school kid' to really look at things in perspective.
And as the old saying goes - education is a great leveller. Of course it would be naive to think that the world could be equal, or that education could 'level' the world completely, but education do go some way to help level the inequality. I dare say that it is more so for a law degree. The law degree gives us access to entry-jobs that are relatively more well paid compared to many of our uni peers, and it gives us a set of skills (in particular legal research and legal reasoning) that is highly valuable and which will only appreciate over time. Though our rich friends will continue to be rich (or richer), do feel privileged that we will be 'climbing the social/economic ladder' as well.
I have friends from universities overseas (they are locals there), and recently I had a conversation with one of them and one of the topic was how I had to study so hard in Singapore. And what he said really struck me. He said that it's so nice that I could really focus on studying and on learning. Because when he had to do his law degree there, he had to take on so many temp jobs that he is constantly exhausted. He said that it's really nice to be a student regardless. This again puts things in perspective for me on how privilege we actually are. Having to work while studying in many countries (regardless in other asian countries, Australia, U.S., or western Europe countries) is actually more common than we think. Being able to generally focus on study is really a privilege that we should be thankful for.
Be less demotivated, my fellow friend. Yes sometimes I do feel green with envy when I look at my friends, but I would quickly shake that off knowing how privilleged I am already.
I am hardly qualified to dispense any 'life advice', but if you would indulge me: of the billions of lives in the world, there are bound to be ones better than our and worst than ours, but the only one that matters is ours - to live our lives happily and with content.

I know this is a very unfair world also for law students. All you people from poor to middle income family should just shut up and work hard. You guys think that my parents who worked so hard over the last decades should take care of lazy people in this society?
I admit I do not have to fight for anything in my life. Since primary school, my parents fetch me from CCAs to Tuition. I can get tuition for whatever subjects I want to push my grades to straight As.Even my internships and training contract are secured through my family's network. My school fee is paid for. My upcoming wedding and house is paid for. My parents still fetch me to school. Life is great. All these are what the rich do for their children. You can say this is network-thing but I tell you this is just how we rich people look after our circle and ensure that the wealth continues to be enjoyed by the next generation. You poor people won't be able to understand nor handle wealth. Yet you poor people just get distracted holding part-time jobs and giving tuition outside school. Blame yourself please.
In this poor market conditions, you do not get a training contract, blame yourself for not coming from a rich family. Your next best option is to find someone rich to marry into. Period.

I don't think I agree with you all completely. Although I find that the the majority of NUS Law is snobbish, there is still a minority that is good. Please don't tar everyone with the same brush. For example, my group of NUS Law friends (who are quite well to do) recently chipped in to pay for my other course mate to pass her part A and B bar exam. I know the divide between rich and poor may sometimes be too much, but we should not forget that there are good people out there that are willing to help. In every place, there is both good and bad. Please don't judge everyone just because of a select group of people.

It's things like this that deters guys from ever approaching girls. Girls rarely give any chance to guys who approach them. It takes serious balls to open up to someone you don't know, and unless the girl already has a BF, I don't see the need for girls to deny guys the chance of getting to know them.
Girls won't care about that though; they will only care if the guy is A HOT CHARMING ALPHA MALE. And guess what? Most F*CKBOYs are like that (I dare anyone who disagrees) and the girls will probably be over the moon that the f*ckboys approached them and will definitely give them a chance.
The f*ckboys know this fact too and use it damn well to their advantage. He can get any girl he wants with relative ease and is never truly invested in one girl and so the f*ckboys will almost always end up breaking girls' hearts.
The guys that girls almost always deny know that every chance they can get is a once-in a lifetime opportunity that they may never get otherwise (because say, they're less appealing in other ways) and will take the girl seriously, hoping that he can win her through his genuine efforts and feelings. But too bad, the girl just don't care...Unless of course, he's all the f*cked up guy he is; girls do love their bad boys, don't they?
Seriously, it baffles me as to why some girls (especially if they're the damn pretty but still single ones ah) can still moan about being single (OMG i'm about to graduate liao but still no BF, shit running out of time on my fertility clock!) and wonder why no guys ever chase them before or why they're always getting into relationships with the wrong guys...

That’s a lot of angst right there friend. Maybe you want to consider that there are some girls out there who have never been asked out or approached and is just waiting for someone to approach her. Never had any luck with guys because all the guys she meets are all either taken or just not interested in her. Never met a single guy who actually told her he likes her or is interested in her before (and most likely its mutual and completely platonic). And she may not even necessarily be ‘ugly’ or have a horrendous personality. She may not even be the type to go for f***boys.
Every girl has her own story and her own opinions. I think guys should realise that the number of girls who turned you down in the past doesn’t affect the probability of the next girl you approach to give you a chance. These two events are mutually exclusive okay. Being turned down merely shows either you were too unlucky to have approached a girl who was already taken, or lucky enough to have avoided a girl who probably does go for f***boys and cares (a lot) about physical appearances, is lesbian, isn’t interested in getting into a relationship, is a hopeless romantic (and yadayadayada).
Granted, maybe the type of girls I mentioned at the start are really hard to find these days, but isn’t that the point? If you’re trying to find the right one it’s not going to be an easy journey. If you don’t have the guts or the motivation to keep trying, then sure, just sit at home and pray to the heavens that one day you’ll just happen to stumble into your ‘right one’.
It’s okay to rant once in a while but really I’m just writing this in response to the millions of complaints here I’ve seen so far about how ‘girls are so unapproachable’ when I know for a fact that there are girls out there thinking ‘why do guys never approach me’.

You are truly daring to post up such gripping unhappiness within yourself. I'm very with you for the
""It takes serious balls to open up to someone you don't know, and unless the girl already has a BF, I don't see the need for girls to deny guys the chance of getting to know them"" AND
""The guys that girls almost always deny know that every chance they can get is a once-in a lifetime opportunity that they may never get otherwise (because say, they're less appealing in other ways) and will take the girl seriously, hoping that he can win her through his genuine efforts and feelings.""
Some of you commenters are very selfish in your reactions by being so critical with #41588 that he's so whiny and loser-like. Yes he might have come across as too emotional and salty with some assumptions/sweeping comments but that doesnt give you the right to merely put him down and brush him off.
The general idea of his unhappiness issue is a real thing out there which ""rejected nice guys"" are dealing with internally in their emotions. We do have this category of (nice) guys who are just this unlucky with girls despite their good-naturedness. They try their best in putting themselves first before others, be an understanding pal and be respectful. From young, this has been their nature instilled within.
So fast forward to now, for them to persistently keep getting rejected by girls just because they were too nice - can't you imagine the uncertainty within themselves as to whether their good virtues are valid in life after all? Or that whatever their parents have taught is going to waste? I'm sure at their first few rejections, they're shocked that their personality can be such an issue in their love life. It sure feels conflicting and ironic that being ""innocent, pure and supportive"" rather than being a f***boy, isn't the way to go. I can't fault him for being so angsty - given the uncertainty in his niceness and supposed unfairness he went thru.
And here are you all supposedly implying from such strong criticism that they should look at themselves, suck it up and stop being such a sore-loser. So basically you're all imposing that these nice guys have to keep all that emotion to themselves and not complain one bit? That very unfair to them and you're just scaring off all other nice guys who are reading the confessions behind their screen that they indeed have no one to turn to about their rejection issues.
The supposed nice guy you might know out there in your social circle could have similar emotional anger and uncertainty buried deep within himself - just that he is being respectful and professional to not anyhow vent it out amongst his peers. The way you all commenters impose on #41553 for his saltiness and loser-like - reaffirms indeed that its such a taboo for a nice guy to complain about why girls reject him - so all the more must bottle up. How would you like it if other people imposed a belief on you that conflicts with your nature? And that you had no one to turn to for advice?
Wasn't this confession platform suppose to be an avenue for rational advice, support and not a place to shoot others down? How confident are other confessors going to be to post about their social problems and get the support, encouragement or advice they need?
Reflect on yourselves really, we don't know entirely what lives the confessors have led. Perhaps #41588 had a really bad hit with his rejections and just feels so complicated within about his feelings. How would you like it if people could never understand the inadequacies you had?
Its really a big joke, this social expectation that guys must be so garang to deal with his weaknesses on his own and that complaining about it even one bit is looked down upon. In real life, he already has put up the front by staying happy, optimistic but bottling up all emotions within. What has humanity become today, where has all love and understanding gone to??
We need more rational people like #41601 who can be diplomatic to address these uncertainties. I salute you #41601 for not joining in the imposing game. No one's perfect. It just so happens this category of guys are weak in getting out of the friendzone. The issue about nice guys and their persistent rejections is definitely real in this day and age and we shouldn't belittle and mock them for not being socially skillful enough to get out of friendzone. The ones who are out there complaining and ranting are indeed the braver few speaking up for all the timid, introverted nice guys out there who don't wish to complain for fear of being stigmatised as whiny. I salute you too for your bravery in speaking up against the norm.
#41588, Although I do feel that whilst you're very unhappy, work on being more tactful. Could you be too nice that u forgot to defend yourself when necessary? This slight modification in your nice-guy personality is good enough to at least make you a more confident, steady and less sorry-state person.
To think this idea of ""nice guys"" and ""friendzone"" is something perceived to be so doomed today . It really goes to show how shallow we are today that 2 people of the opposite gender must end up tgt and that only rogue guys win/finish first. The innocence has all been lost in boy-girl friendships - let alone relationships. So much social and gender expectations to complicate and ruin the innocence in this. Very disappointing.

It seems like the whole 'nice guy' issue crops up every year without fail, so here are my two cents worth. To put this into perspective, I am male.
First, I think the whole 'nice guy'/'f***boy' dichotomy needs to be deconstructed. I find it somewhat amusing that many self proclaimed 'nice guys' label other males deemed more successful with the opposite sex a 'f***boy' (or something similar like 'roguish'). What proof do you have that these guys that the opposite sex are attracted to are indeed below the moral standards of 'nice guys'? Because the relationships don't always work out? Relationships end for various reasons. Also, human personalities are too complex to be placed in two mutually exclusive personalities. You are in University (I assume). You should know this.
Next, 'nice guys'. What does this even mean? I only ever hear 'nice guys' giving themselves this monicker. According to the post I am replying to, it's someone ""innocent, supportive, and pure"". Pretty vague of you ask me. I will venture a guess that this means 'nice guys' will be there to shower the objects of their affection with attention and support, always willing to be a shoulder to cry on, without expecting anything in return (god forbid if it's anything sexual, because this makes them a f***boy). Well, if you 'nice guys' are doing what you do without expectations, why be upset when a girl wants to only be a friend? Why assume it's because you are not 'roguish' enough? Were you expecting her to fall for you just because you are so ""innocent, supportive, and pure""? Were you only being really nice to a girl because you are interested in her? Newsflash, there is nothing nice about 'trading' being nice in exchange for a relationship with a girl.
Therein lies my issue with the self proclaimed 'nice guys'. If you are being nice just because it's your personality rather than because you are expecting something in return, you should not throw a hissy fit when told that the object of your interest will not reciprocate. How do you claim to be nice when you think that girls should not be able to decide on their own that they don't really want to entertain someone wanting to ""get to know them"". Quote:""It takes serious balls to open up to someone you don't know, and unless the girl already has a BF, I don't see the need for girls to deny guys the chance of getting to know them"". The level of self-entitlement is just mind-boggling. So girls should willingly spend time letting ""nice guys get to know them"" every time someone shows up claiming to want to win them over with ""genuine efforts and feelings""?
To end my long rant with an advice to many self-proclaimed 'nice guys' out there. Girls are smart. They can tell when your niceness is conditioned on the possibility that they may return your affections. And stop with this self-entitlement. No one owes you their affection and time just because you are nice to them. Remember, often these acts of ""niceness"" are not even something they wanted in the first place.

I can sorta feel #41620's angst, his vehemence about the nice guys issue makes me recall my own rejection experiences in the past. I can somewhat draw parallels to his confusions as to why the rejections still happen.
For my experiences, my feelings for the girls' only came about after getting to know them better and keeping each other company more often - daily school interaction, studying together, chatting online etc. At the start, I didn't even think I would like them. I can say only I started to realise their physical ""chio-ness"" after realising our personalities could gel. Then we get that perfect combi of personality and physical attraction. Although yes I naturally also would want someone pretty, I still look lots at the girl's personality and attitude to even get that spark to have a crush on them. That perfect combi is always what I aspire for.
So I thought their keen interest in actually wanting to interact with me (as so I thought from their spontaneous vibes and their initiative in wanting to know me) and that we shared common experiences and shortcomings, I thought after sometime we could be something. But sadly it didn't.
The first girl whom I eventually confessed to rejected me for another guy. That other guy grew to be someone really attention-seeking, shallow and even has that drip of sarcasm and fakeness in conversations with others. I grew to dislike him because back in earlier years when he was still single - he wasn't even this cocky at all and more humble. I can even regret not being tactful enough to let him step all over me by trying his insincere sarcastic conversations on me. Quite horrible. Even up till this day I still don't understand why she specifically chose this very guy over others - like please there were also other decent guys to choose from if u rejected me.
The second girl - Initially, she would only come to me for academic work purposes but further down the road we eventually could converse about other topics like holidays, tease each other etc so naturally that I thought chemistry built up. Later on I got friendzoned but was still deluded we were something. Eventually when I asked her out it didn't go well. And from then on, it was difficult to maintain relations like in the past. It didn't feel as spontaneous as before
After that, it got complicated, I could somehow only bring myself converse online and not in RL for fear of being awkward in front of her. There was lots of up downs - sometimes we could still chat and help each other even in RL as normal and sometimes we wouldn't talk. Yet I still had false hopes that we could still maintain a friendship at least. However, I just could feel the drifting apart because she was sticking more towards our other classmates and looked happier with them instead. It made me feel disappointed and cheated that I was once again contributing one-sided and that all our past fun/memories didn't mean anything.
TL:DR I got rejected twice. All these experiences have since only left me confused with whether IT WAS JUST ME or THEM? Like the first girl - are these honestly the preferred choices today?? Or for the second girl - why the sudden drift away from me even when I still at least want to make things as natural as possible between us?? It makes me feel that revealing your feelings for someone is a mistake. Then when you look at other people, they have it so easy. They just get together... Though sometimes you feel certain people really dont deserve it given their attitude.
Many people supposedly label me as a unique person and even girls in the initial stages can admit they're wowed by my hobbies/interests. Maybe I was too full of myself. I've come to realise that my supposed uniqueness is something hard to accept for an r/s. Now I can't bring myself to anyhow share this part of me to new peeps I meet unless I can tell from their vibes that they wont mind it.
So honestly I just wonder if this ""nice guys"" nature is playing such a big issue in getting someone to like you. Let's not even talk abt F***boys - but must one be really some guai lan show attitude ASS (regardless big or small extent) to get a girl? I honestly can't fathom such a thought and change myself as such coz ik that wont showcase my true self. At most, I can change to be a more tactful person in my daily interactions but certainly not this. Lol sometimes I do wonder if I should change as part of bitterness and that I have nothing to lose since no one can somehow like me.
For myself, I've been trying to think less about this past I had and focus more on my unique interests. Its not easy really, I just have so much unjust, unfairness and confusion given the logics I have witnessed from all this. It does randomly haunt me at times on my chances in future girls.
