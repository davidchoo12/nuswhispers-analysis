60259,106402,"I feel depressed because I was rejected by a girl on a personal level, most likely due to my financial background.
So I’m a guy, fresh into uni and new to relationships. Last semester I somehow get the courage to ask out this girl in the same year as me. Long story short, we hit off very well. We met up 5 times over a month, most times for an activity and not just a meal. On the 6th meeting, I sense the vibe is strong and I confess my feelings for her.
Up to this point I’m 100% confident she likes me back. But then to my utter surprise and horror, she says, “let’s just be friends, I’m not really into dating.”
I’m taken aback and I ask her why. She is surprisingly amiable and she takes some time to explain that it’s nothing to do with me but her, that she’s ‘just not into dating’ and doesn’t feel the need to get into a relationship. She also claimed that she honestly thought all those outings were just as friends and she didn’t know they were intended to be dates and apologised if she sent the wrong signals.
Regarding the “I just don’t want to date” line, I’ve heard countless times before that such rejections are actually personal. On NUSWhispers and also among my friends, there’s this saying: When a girl says she doesn’t want to date at all, she’s just trying to let you down easy, but actually she just doesn’t want to date YOU personally.
It's basically common knowledge.
Knowing the rejection was personal was so depressing. I suffered a mental breakdown over the next few days. It hurt like hell and got me agonising over what part of me is so bad. Some part of me must be so repulsive that I would get rejected on a personal level, especially with that cliché excuse of “I’m just not looking to date”. This excuse that covered up an unknown reason pained me to know that I had some personal problem that was so severe the girl must have deemed too hurtful to say out.
I agonised over why she didn’t like me. I narrowed it down to the 3 main common reasons: looks, education level, or financial status.
Now I know there could be other reasons, such as not feeling a romantic connection, incompatibility or mismatched personalities, which are completely possible and valid reasons for rejection, but I don’t think that’s the case here, otherwise the girl could have just told me she felt we didn’t click / were not compatible / I'm not her type; and such reasons are good and not hurtful at all. Furthermore we went out so frequently. Since she used the “just not into dating at all” excuse, she’s most likely lying to hide a deeper reason, and is trying to be nice because the real reason could be too hurtful for me to bear. So I think the reason is unlikely to be incompatibility or mismatched personalities, not least also because we shared a lot of similar hobbies like painting, music, etc. to name a few.
So such a hurtful reason has to be either looks, education level or financial status (I can’t think of any other reason too hurtful to say out).
I agonised for weeks after that, wondering what was wrong with me. It sure as hell cannot be education level as we were in the same year and taking the exact same course, down to the same minor. We both said we were aiming to continue doing a masters after our degree. As for looks... it’s very unlikely to be my looks as we went out multiple times. Also my friends all agree she was within my league in the looks department. And she was shorter than me.
So, that just left financial status.
As full time students who are not earning a steady income of our own yet, I once thought financial background didn’t matter much as long as I was still decently dressed and able to pay for dates. After all, we were in the same course, and it should be our future prospects that mattered more, right? Apparently, not in this case. I got the feeling she’s from a richer background than me and she probably realised it too. Because through our conversations, I found out she attended an expensive private high school, lives in the central area of a major city (she is a foreign student btw), and travelled to more Western countries than me. Doesn’t take a genius to figure out who is from a more well-off background. To clarify, I’m definitely not poor, I’m middle class. I don’t have student loans and both my parents work decent white collar jobs, but my background is definitely not as wealthy as hers.
And I’m pretty sure she knows I’m middle class because she asked what my parents were working as, and also asked what countries I’ve been to. And yes, I also paid for some of the ‘dates’ at decent eateries. But perhaps her financial standards were just too high.
Now I’m not saying that girls are gold diggers, but I heard that even in todays day and age, well-off women with their own money still want to date guys of equal or higher financial background compared to them, not because they are gold diggers and want the guy’s money, but simply because a higher financial status makes one look more successful and attractive overall.
So yeah, the girl most likely lied that she’s just not into dating to hide the hurtful truth of what she truly felt, that she thought my financial status was too low for her. Furthermore she is a foreign student from a country whose citizens have a reputation for being highly materialistic and judging others based on financial background. Deride me all you want for stereotyping or generalising, but like I mentioned earlier, rejection based on financial background seems most plausible. Furthermore, I have friends from that particular country who always specified that whenever girls from their country say “its not personal, I just don’t want to date in general”, the rejection is in fact personal and the other party is bullshitting.
So yeah, it has to be financial status. The only reason that is both personal and too hurtful to say out. Either that or there’s something else so repulsive about me that I’m hit with that cliche excuse.
And now I'm hurt like shit. Especially because of that girl's excuse.
Even if you don't agree with my assessment on it having been due to financial background, you can't deny that the rejection was personal towards me, and some part of me must have been so repulsive to the point she would use that 'not into dating at all' excuse. Either way, the rejection sure was personal. And the reason hurtful and terrible enough for the girl to use that cliche excuse.
So this happened months ago, but I still feel pained by it. Sucks to be rejected on a personal level, and judged for your financial background. My self esteem has been shattered and I am depressed. Trying to get this off my chest before the next semester…

60718,107400,"My bf of 7years just graduated this year and is currently earning 4k a month. Throughout these years I have never once requested any big value gifts and the most expensive item he had gotten me was a ring and bag that cost around 700+ in total for anniversary.
Recently I chanced upon a Gucci bag which cost around 2k+ and I hinted to him that I really like it and asked if he could buy it for me for our next anniversary. He replied that he can’t as he is saving for a nice proposal ring which is expensive. So, I proposed to him to just get me the Gucci bag and I am fine with a normal ring i.e less than a thousand since proposal is just for the sake of showing to the elders and I am not really keen in proposal rings either. Moreover we will be wearing wedding bands after marriage and the proposal ring will most likely be kept inside the drawer for most of the time.
Just when I thought this was a good deal for him since he doesn’t have to spend as much, he flared up and raged at me, claiming that he will not buy me the Gucci bag as he wants to save his money for other stuffs. He said that it is his money and he shall decide what he spends his money on, and if I am really so desperate for the bag, I could leave him for another guy who is willing to get me such branded bags.
I know he is a little stingy with his money since the start and up till now, we are still splitting for dates even though he will mostly let me pay few dollars less. But is this a red flag about his character? I assume he lied and isn’t even intending to spend on an expensive ring. Otherwise, he would be more than happy to take on my idea of getting the bag I like and at the same time, he can save his money by spending less on the ring.

61077,108171,"Dear Prof Ben, please help me out.
I just got married not long ago and moved in with my husband. However after moving in together I found that my husband is an extremely disrespectful person. 
We work from home in the same study room and as someone who loves to chat, during the day I often initiate conversations with my husband but he's never paying attention to me. He's always deep in his work and even when I'm talking he is still looking at his computer and typing away. I have raised this issue multiple times to him and he says his work requires a lot of concentration and he can't respond to me immediately every time I talk to him. He says we can allocate time during the day to talk, like during lunch or tea breaks, but not when he's working. However, I'm someone who needs to get something off my chest right away so what he proposed is unacceptable to me.
I find such behavior so rude and am contemplating a divorce. We don't have a kid yet and the stakes are low now. Other than this ignoring behavior, he's actually a responsible husband. Should I go ahead with it?

61012,108012,"I just got married less than a few months ago. I accidentally saw some screenshots of a sexy influencer on my husband’s phone. I confronted him about it, and he apologised saying that it is habitual. I forgave him and reminded him that he is now married with a wife. For context, we’ve been together almost 10 years before we got married. 
Few days passed, and things went back to normal. But my gut feeling says no. I know it’s bad but i snooped his iphone gallery. I know i’m looking for trouble at this point but I just needed confirmation. The photos are no longer in his gallery, but it’s under the Hidden folder. My heart sank when i saw thousands and thousands of not only screenshots of sexy influencers, but also sneaky photos he took of his friends who are girls. Some butt pics, cleavage. Some of these girls, he went out with without my knowledge after I wished him goodnight, after cross checking the dates of these outings with our past messages. There were also photos of absolute strangers at the gym, on the plane which he sneakily took. While these photos were not recent (like within this year), it all happened within the course of our relationship.
I am very disappointed, hurt and disgusted. Now i am in a dilemma. Do i confront him about it even though it’s mainly in the past (except for the recent ones he screenshotted) and risk our marriage? Because I snooped around without his permission. Or do I close one eye and pretend everything is okay, but knowing he could likely do it again? It’s definitely going to cause trust issues between us both for both scenarios - i can’t trust him anymore with his predatory behaviour, and he can’t trust me coz of my snooping. How do i go forward?

60782,107547,"When you break up with your rich gf to be with a pretty one and it ended up ruining your life.
My first gf was in nus. She comes from a rich family. I know exactly the type of guy she like so I became exactly that to get her. It was great when we're dating. She would surprise me with dates of staycations, fancy restaurants, movie nights. I would offer to pay but she would decline as she knows I'm still giving part time tuition to supplement my allowance as I'm also studying.
Tbh I'm not that into her but I kept it going as I really enjoyed the company and the lifestyle. I come from a humble background but have always aspired to make it big when I graduate.
Then this new girl entered my life. She's the hottest girl I've ever met irl. She also happen to be newly single and all the guys were swooning and wanting to get her attention. I was lucky enough to have common friends with her and got introduced.
Fate was on my side, my old gf had an argument with me and I used the chance to break up with her. I did my best to make it seem that it was coincidental. When I couldn't wait any longer I openly pursued the new girl.
I admit I was aggressive in chasing her as I knew she had other suitors. Things didn't work out as well as I thought once we are officially together.
We argued everyday. It was mostly because I suspect she was still talking to other guys. I can't help myself and would get angry when she has other guys around her when in school. Why can't she just hang out with the girls?! I hate her best guy friend who's known her since she was in secondary school. Why must they still keep in contact? Aren't I enough?
I bought a diamond ring for her to wear which she did but I still think it's not enough. We still argue everyday. I'm so bloody angry with her. Why can't she just not give me reasons to doubt her?!
I made so many arrangements with her. Set up bank account together with her. We leave personal belongings in each other's place. I mostly want her to leave her things at my place because it's easier for her to stay over at my place as her family are not nice.
I have lost count the number of times we argue, break up, I buy flowers to win her back. I admit I let my insecurity get the better of me sometimes. But it's her fault. She's too pretty and she did nothing to assure me that she won't cheat on me.
When she started her internship I knew she would stray one day and I was right. I caught her walking with a male colleague out of the office building. When I confronted her she told him to quickly leave. If they were platonic, why won't she introduce me?! She said I'm embarrassing her. I snatched her phone and left and she didn't even chase after me. Isn't this a sign of guilt?
She said its over so many times until I don't believe her anymore. I always am able to coax her back to me. But not anymore after this. I suspect she's seeing someone who works with her. That is the only explanation.
I destroyed everything of hers that she left at my place and she closed out the bank account that we shared and dared to tell me she was the only one putting money in so the money is all hers. What about the amount of money I spent on her?! That diamond ring isn't cheap! She had the cheek to change her numbers and even got her family to hang up on me. I made sure she remember everything that happened is her fault. She ruined me. I will never forgive her!
Pretty girls are over rated. She doesn't even have much money and yet acted like I'm the money greedy one. Wait till I earn 100k per annum, I'm sure she will regret leaving me!

60413,106739,"Sayonara Singapore.
I came to Singapore 15 years ago, thinking of making Singapore my home, as it came on top choices compared to other countries, such as US, Australia and Canada. I have studied here and meet my wife here and had my baby here, however Singapore had a different plan. I am a PR for more than 10 years and they are not ready to give my wife a PR even though she has studied here and been here almost same time as me and they rejected application my wife's and my child's PR. So HDB is out of choice. We both make a combined income of 10k+ but more and more money is squeezed out of us. Looks like Singapore Values free money from China and Hong Kong than integrating locally trained people.
At present our house house hold expenditure is more than 80% of our income and our life style is just average, so you can earn and have a decent life in Singapore. But we feel we are just Surviving here and not really living. We are not evening talking about luxury here like car, condo etc. Just a basic life. And it's same for my Singapore friends but slightly better because of HDB. In general, Singapore is becoming a advanced society with surviving people.
What I see from Govt plan is either you are super rich or under 3k family income rest all will just be rich on paper but poor in real life. All my class mates (locals) have already left Singapore and I didn't listen to their advice to pack up 10 years ago. Now, I am Surviving. When I tell about these things , most locals will complain you can go back where you came from, but if we keep having such mentalities Singapore will become next Japan.
Right now, govt is happy to collect millions from foreigners ABSB and giving $300 CDC vouchers to keeps locals mouth shut. So, till govt doesn't prioritise welfare of people, Sg will be millionaires zombie land.

Things are looking up for me and I also have a hunch that my boyfriend is going to propose soon because he has been probing me alot about ring preferences alot in the recent months. TBH he doesn't really have any red flags and has alot of green flags: he's kind, caring, family-oriented and gentlemanly. Sxx is also very good and it helps that we both have high libido. Career-wise he is also doing very well too. I genuinely do see a future with him and want to start a family with him.
HOWEVER theres just 1 thing... He is 10 years older than me and we've been dating for about 10 years as well. And if you did the math... Well yeah, I think you'd get it. It kinda was child grooming? I'll admit we starting having sex really early on into the relationship (less than a year) and we have been active throughout. We also haven't been using any protection but in his defence, it was a mutual decision.
Honestly I'm torn after doing some self-reflection.On one hand, i really love him and want to have a family. On the other I find it hard to come to peace with the past. I find it kinda messed up. I'm afraid that others will know about the past and whether it will affect my ability to be a good mother to my children. I would say yes in a heart beat if he asked me for marriage a few months ago but now I'm not sure. Please advice this troubled girl!

60318,106546,"My dad is a wildly successful business owner with a tech recruitment agency with operations in New York City and San Francisco, and a net worth in the tens of millions. We live in a bungalow in Bukit Timah. He always told me and my older brother that we should never aim to be a corporate slaves because if one were to commit to working hard for anyone, it should only be for ourselves. I have been told this multiple times for nearly 30 years of my life. He is also of the opinion that people who strive to do very well in school and for their company, will rarely create life-changing wealth, because they are too socialized to doing well for others.
I have done well in school. I went to the best IP school and I graduated FCH from law school. Near the top of my cohort. I then got a masters from Cambridge, where I was also near the top of my cohort. Now that I’ve gotten a big four law job, I feel that my life is comfortable, I make good money, my bosses love me, and I feel no incentive to make it on my own. I was even told in passing that if I keep up my work I could make partner one day.
On the other hand, my older brother is a bioengineer, didn’t do that well for A-levels, graduated from the University of Michigan and then UC Davis, quit his pharma job to start an agricultural technology company in California with four of his friends from college that recently fund raised at an 8-figure valuation. Recently there was even an acquisition attempt that was rejected. Needless to say my dad has started to overwhelmingly favor him over me. He went to the same IP school as I did he was just very lazy about schoolwork.
I have a weird upbringing in that I used to bring home great grades from school and my dad was never impressed. My brother is a tinkerer and he built a PC at the age of 14 and back then my dad couldn’t stop bragging to relatives about it. At 16 he wrote a password manager on iOS that made a few thousand dollars in its first year and I literally have not seen my dad so proud about anything that I’ve ever done before. Not even when I was in the Humanities Programme and ranked 3rd on a literature block test in my JC cohort of 1000 people.
One thing he has never done is gave me explicit instructions to do anything. He has always believed in giving us a lot of freedom to try things and to fail. What affects me deeply is his unwillingness to show any regard towards those who are not inclined to challenge conventional life goals. I once overheard a conversation between him and my mom in the bedroom after he showed absolutely no reaction when I ranked first in my sec 2 class. He told my mom, “all he did was work very hard studying to do well on an exam, what’s so special about that?” That hurt me deeply. He has this deep distaste for what he believes to be a “typical Singaporean philosophy”—do well in school, get a good job, promote, make some money, retire. Which I frankly don’t know where he got it from since he also went to Raffles College, and he also has a degree from Cambridge.
I respect him greatly and I just wish to get some approval from him. I’m just not an enterprising person by nature. I find it odd that someone would look down on people who do well academically and aim to do well at their jobs. If my brother’s startup hadn’t been an immediate success he would have been working for no pay and no reward for 5 years. The amount of money I saved in the past 3 years alone gets me 80% of the way to making a downpayment on my first apartment. There was no risk involved. If I keep being on this trajectory I’d have more money than I know what to do with anyway. I honestly don’t need anymore than $5 million to retire comfortably.
I don’t hate my brother. I’m incredibly proud of him even though I used to not be able to stand it when his exam was literally 24 hours away and he’d be twiddling his pen in the living room watching anime. It always seemed to me that he was squandering his talent since I know him to be very intelligent. He learns things ridiculously quickly. Nevertheless I think the world values all sorts of people and I am incredibly happy that he has the creative energy that startup founders often share. I just don’t understand why my dad values people like him and not people who can really take an instruction and deliver the best work.

60748,107476,"Nice guys finish last. When guys are nice to me, it makes me not want to be with them. Really turns me off.
When you say you want to eat something, or watch a movie, I will purposely mention something else different that I want to eat or watch instead. And if you try to be nice to me by changing your mind and say you are okay with eating or watching the same movie as me, I rather date someone more manly than you.
I want a man who dares to oppose me and do something different from what I say I want. If I say I want to eat this, you better oppose and suggest something else instead. STOP BEING SO NICE AND SAY YOU OKAY TO EAT THE SAME THING I WANT!
Sometimes I like to purposely disturb the guy and see what he do. If I insult you a bit and you dare to insult me back, or be insecure about it, especially if I try to tease things about your insecurity, then it means you are not manly enough. A manly man will not insult me back, and will not be insecure even if I try to disturb and hurt him. A manly man will show me that he can handle it and not be affected by me.
I don't want to need to tell you what to do, you should know that whatever I tell you to do, you should not do. If not, then bye. It is not that we girls like to date bad boys, but bad boys are the ones who dare to oppose us and do what we do not want them to do. Too bad they also treat us like crap.

60392,106699,"How can I reject my boyfriend's marriage proposal in the least hurtful way possible? I (25F) and my boyfriend K (26M) have known each other since JC and have dated for 4 years. He has always been good to me, treats me well, and I have no doubt that he loves me very much. Recently, I heard from a friend that he has been shopping around for engagement rings and planning for a surprise proposal. Although this should have been happy news for most girls, I actually felt worried, sad and confused instead.
The truth is, deep down inside I fear that I may have already fallen out of love with K. All my life I have been an (almost) straight As student and usually scored in the top 10-20% of the cohort. I am quite ambitious and competitive in my outlook, and some might even call me an overachiever. Since graduation, I have secured a pretty cushy job that pays close to 5 digits with high hopes for my future career progression.
K is quite the opposite academically. Back in school he was a bit of a joker and would rather spend his days hanging out with friends than revising. Although he was in a good school, his grades consistently scraped the bottom of the barrel and he said he ""just wasn't cut out for studying"". Despite this, K actually has very lofty goals and holds himself to (his own) high standards. He has always talked about his dreams of making it big as an entrepreneur and to be his own boss by the age of 30.
Although I desperately want to be supportive of his dreams, honestly I find many of his business ideas naive, ill-conceived and financially unfeasible. I tried my best to rescue several of his past ""big ideas"" by helping him research business regulations, liaise with industry partners etc. Yet, all of them turned a massive flop because they were fundamentally flawed to begin with. As he fast approaches 30, I think reality is sinking in that he is unlikely to reach his goal and will be stuck in his 3k/month admin job forever. In the past year or so, he has been showing signs of depression such as chronic oversleeping and self-destructive thoughts which has further sucked him into a downward spiral. I suspect that his pride is also wounded by the ever-widening gap between our life trajectories as he would refuse to come to company D&Ds with me as my +1.
I feel that my love for K has been slowly whittled down by the endless cycle of his doomed entrepreneurial ventures. I am exhausted from juggling multiple hats as girlfriend, therapist and business consultant. At the risk of sounding materialistic, I also find it hard to see a future with him buying a house and raising kids with equal financial contributions as I will probably end up paying for the bulk of it while also trying to protect his pride. With that being said, I will always care deeply for K given all the happy times we have shared together and everything he has done for me. He is a good and kind man who truly loves me with all of his heart, and I don't want to crush him completely especially given the current rut he is in. How can I let him down as gently as possible about his plans for a proposal, and would it be cruel for me to ask for a break/ a break up now?

60290,106484,"Do you have friends that like just suddenly have an exponential growth stage out of nowhere?
This guy I knew in sec school was the definition of stupid and lazy, didn't do homework, didn't do any studying, pulled his own weight in projects but that was it. Ended up not doing so well for O levels for my school's standards, and went to some obscure neighborhood JC. He was one of those people you either loved or hated and basically that was the class verdict on him, half of them liked him and half of us didn't at all.
So like obviously I don't think about him the next few years because I'm also in JC and then army and then Uni, so like I heard about him during army from a couple of my friends and it seemed that he didn't do well enough to make it into local uni. And yeah that was it for a long time.
Then today I meet a junior who tells me that his (my junior's) classmate is in the same... idk lab group? (sry marketing major, don't understand science organization) as this friend of mine. And apparently he graduated (somehow) from NUS with a FCH.
Is that even fair? How did he even get in? You all know how hard it is to get As in uni and this guy can get As reliably? If he was in marketing or arts or something that wasn't obviously so science I'd question it less but this is like... engineering and sciences. He wasn't even good at science and didn't even pass math.
He's not even from a branded JC leh, and you see all these branded JC kids finding it hard to get FCH then this guy casually can't even make it in JC and secondary but all of a sudden FCH. I don't get it lol it's not like he worked hard during uni.

60865,107687,"TW: R*pe / SA. Need to ask everyone's opinion here. Also long story but please do read. 
So a guy (Let's call him Matt) and his gf (Let's call her Jenn) lives together. They've been doing good together, until one day, they argue about going to a night club. Let's just say Matt doesn't want Jenn to go to a night club cause he's worried about her safety.
But Jenn insist, saying she'll be just fine. Matt still wouldn't allow it. So they argued a lot. Jenn however, always find a way to go to the club. Either by lying about her location, made excuses, or simply just wait for Matt to fall asleep early. Everytime Matt found out, he'll get mad cause he's so worried about her. Jenn however, continued to do this like more than 10 times, and got caught by Matt at least 7 times. 
Matt is very forgiving, but even he has a limit. The only thing he doesn't want Jenn to do is to go to a night club. That's it. Nothing else. But Jenn didn't care. Matt told her, that if she goes there again, one more time, the relationship is over. Jenn, thinking it's just another chance, simply just go out anyways. She doesn't care anymore. 
Unfortunately for that night, after hours in the night club, she got r*ped and SAed by a guy there. She called Matt, crying, told him everything that happened. Matt immediately drove and picked her up, went to the hospital and police station immediately to make reports and gather all those evidence. Took hours, 
but thankfully, the evidence gathered are clear, and the police said for now, they can go home while they go make an arrest on the suspect. It was very late night at that point. 
Matt, however, drove Jenn back to her parents' house. Jenn feeling confused and asked why. Matt said that he's sorry about everything that happened to her and it's not her fault, however, he's a man of his word. He said that he did warned her that if she goes to the club one more time, the relationship is over. Regardless of what happens, even if she's safe and nothing bad happen, the relationship is still over. Matt did say that if she needed help about the case, he'll help. But that doesn't mean he and Jenn are together. 
He already packed every Jenn's belongings from his house the moment she walked out to go to the club. All of it is in the car, and he carried it for her to her parents'. Jenn, crying and begging, asking him not to leave her and said she won't do it again. Matt however, said that he has his limit too. And he said why does it need for this horrible thing to happen then only she'll listen. Before he leaves, he told her again, that he's sorry about what happened, and that if she needed any help with the case, he'll help. But that's it. 
So, the question is, is Matt wrong for doing what he did in the end?

60264,106415,"I’m a guy who was led on by a girl… mildly infuriating.
Firstly, my story.
So one day in class I saw this girl I liked and asked her out to lunch. She said yes. We had lunch at a nice restaurant in a shopping mall, where I paid. From then on, we got along very well, we frequently met up, and chatted very well, all over the period of a month. By ‘well’, I mean ALL our meet-ups were one-to-one, we took turns treating each other to lunches, and we texted each other for hours on end, sometimes late into the night.
I was interested in her, and I also thought she was interested in me.
Then one fine day I confess my feelings for her. She looks genuinely shocked (and I’m shocked at her reaction too), then she says “I’m sorry, I already have a boyfriend, I thought we were just friends…”
By the way we have a mutual friend whom I’ve known for some time. But I only met the girl a month ago, so she wasn’t my friend prior to me asking her out. It was pure coincidence that my friend happened to know the girl quite well.
Later I found out from this friend that she already had a bf LONG before she met me, and she only saw me as a good friend from the very start. This friend also told me that she felt bad if she gave me the wrong impressions and was truly just trying to make new friends in the course, and wasn’t some stupid reason like trying to make her bf jealous.
The mutual friend is someone I know for some time and trust. So, if she truly is a nice person and wasn’t trying to make her bf jealous or what, I think she led me on because she was either lonely or something.
Now, my rant.
This has left me feeling kinda infuriated. I feel like I’ve wasted emotions. I invested some degree of emotions into this only to get heartbroken. Like, girls, ASSUMING you aren’t doing morally questionable things like gold-digging or making your bf jealous, you don’t agree to lunch at a RESTAURANT, with a NEW guy one-to-one, AND let him pay, AND to top it all off CONTINUE to meet up with him in a similar fashion, UNLESS you are interested in him as more than a friend, right? It’s just not normal! If you were interested in a new guy at first but later lost interest, then fair enough, but this girl already had a bf and wasn’t interested as more than a friend from the start. So it was really unfair for her to agree to go out one-to-one with me more than once, when she was never interested, as that would give me the wrong idea that she’s interested when she never was.
Sharing this partly as an appeal for all not to lead others on. It’s just not right.

60296,106497,"I was just 17 years old when my life fell apart. It all started with my first boyfriend. He was my age, and we had been dating for a few months. I thought he was the one, but I was wrong. He got me pregnant twice and I had to get abortions both times. It was a difficult and painful experience, but I thought it was all worth it for love.
My second boyfriend was 9 years older than me. I thought he would be more mature and responsible, but he ended up being just as bad as my first boyfriend. He was controlling and manipulative, and I couldn't get away from him fast enough.
My third boyfriend was only 5 years older than me, but he was the worst of them all. He played me like a fool and left me feeling used and worthless.
I was so focused on my relationships that I neglected everything else in my life. I used to vape and smoke a lot, and it affected my studies. I did very badly for my O levels, only getting 39 points. It was a far cry from the 213 points I got for my PSLE. I was in Secondary 5 when I took my O levels, and everything went downhill from there.
I was a Chinese girl and I thought I was fairly good-looking, but it didn't seem to matter. I thought that love would be the answer to everything, but it only brought me pain and misery. I couldn't help but feel like my life was ruined. I felt like I had nothing left to live for.
I used to be such a hopeful and optimistic person, but after all that had happened to me, I couldn't see the point in anything anymore. I felt like I was just a shell of my former self, and I didn't know how to move on.
I couldn't help but blame myself for everything that had happened. I thought maybe if I had made different choices, things would have turned out differently. But it was too late for that now. I was stuck in a cycle of regret and self-loathing, and I didn't know how to break free from it.
I wish I had known then what I know now. I wish I had realized that love isn't always enough, and that you have to take care of yourself first and foremost. But it's too late for me now, and I'm left to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.

60903,107786,"How much should I give an unsupportive family?
27yo here who's about to start a first ft job. My pay is already well under median (4500) for a fresh grad from my course, and my parents expects me to give them an allowance of $1000 a month, approx 30% of my salary before CPF, inspired by my brother who's 23 and never has to pay for anything in his life including his uni and various hobbies unlike me, but he gives 100% of his internship allowance to them knowing they will happily take care of him.
My family is decently well to do, so money's not an issue for my parents. I'm obviously not the favorite child and am trying to save up quickly to move out, knowing that my parents will never be satisfied no matter how much I give them. I haven't even started work, and it's already ""Pay us allowance of $1000/month, or get out from the house and go rent a room for $1800 a month"". They know the housing market is messed up, and keep bemoaning that my room would be of better use ""rented out"". They're already chasing me to get out on a near daily basis, and it's clear they quickly want to burn bridges with me.
Here's why: My parents see me as an unfilial freeloader as I don't give them money at all -- I hustle and manage my money strictly, saving and investing (and reinvesting) nearly 80% of all the money I get from a few part time gigs into a few decently performing side businesses instead of giving them 100% of it like my brother. I haven't taken allowance from them since JC, I don't owe them anything, and quit clubbing when I was 18 to hustle and start my business, and have paid nearly 80% of my school loan off already working as a part time worker during my degree. I know that I can never rely on my parents to support me in any way, so I've got only myself to rely on, and I do not want to drag my girlfriend into this. Therefore I don't want to give them any money honestly, given that they've been less than supportive in my life.
To get advice for my situation, I'd like to ask here:
How should I deal with this impasse? When's the average age of moving out of the house? How much do fresh grads give their parents every month? And how does one remind their parents that it's their child, not a CPF (Child Paying for Family) retirement policy? 
Would appreciate some advice beyond ""suck thumb bruh, life's like that"" please! Thanks everyone.

My exes did not want children for fear of damaging their figure.

60483,106875,"First of all, context. Family is very well-to-do. Mom doesn’t work (though she has a law degree) but dad ran his own law firm for 30 years, recently retired.
This is an issue with parents not paying for my wedding.
Mom doesn’t get involved in things. Dad has refused to speak to my girlfriend since we started dating and it’s all because my girlfriend is a Chinese-speaking, practicing Taoist from a poor family in Malaysia, and a vegetarian.
My dad is a banana. Doesn’t speak Chinese at all, read law at Cambridge (PSC scholar), freethinker. Doesn’t think I should marry this girl because she has a large low-income family and an even larger low-income extended family and he thinks I am getting myself into a lot of trouble by marrying her. My girlfriend doesn’t know English very well, so she prefers to speak Mandarin with a heavy Malaysian accent. She’s from a small town in Malaysia. She came to Singapore to work but her family are all still back in Kedah. She goes back often. I’ve been there a couple of times.
My girlfriend requested if we could have two banquets, one in Singapore and one for her extended family and friends back in her hometown. My dad told me if I had chosen to marry a middle-class Singapore girl from an English-speaking family he would’ve paid for everything. He would have also bought us a condo and a car. But since I have decided to marry this girl, which to him isn’t a very smart thing to do, he will not pay for anything.
My older brother married his JC sweetheart from Hwa Chong and my dad literally paid for a Fullerton Hotel banquet, an entry level Lexus, and they are in the process of looking for a condo, will also be paid for by my dad. Besides the point.
I don’t have money right now for a wedding, let alone 2. My fiancé said that the wedding in Malaysia is a must, and my parents have to go to Kedah for a bride price negotiation ritual that my dad has categorically refused to participate. Called it idiotic. My mom has also called it “incredibly stupid” and refused to come with me to Malaysia without my dad. My fiancé’s parents said they wouldn’t agree to the marriage if all of these formalities are not done. My fiancé is powerless. She has a rather meek personality.
My fiancé doesn’t want to register our marriage before these formalities are done because she feels she needs her parents’ blessing or else she wouldn’t be able to face her family. Wants me to find a way to convince my parents to participate. My dad has repeatedly used the phrase “third-world bullshit” and I don’t think he’s ever coming around. One way is to convince my mom to do it alone but she’s as much of a banana as my dad is and she also hates tradition.
I feel stuck because my fiancé’s wants her parents’ blessing, her parents will only give us their blessing if my parents participate in the rituals and come to an agreement, but my parents do not agree to my marrying this girl in the first place. Even if this first part is done, I still have no money for a banquet.

Then got the prettyboys who have interests but cannot talk.
Then got those who cannot present themselves well, but can talk... however, it is only about work.
Then finally got the legend that looked 46 years old at 26, insulted the disabled waiters - in one of those 'manned only by the disabled' cafés - within 5 minutes of sitting down, insulted me within 20 minutes of that, and blamed immigrants for him (poly dropout with no interest in upskilling, no side hustles, and clearly no ability to remove his foot from his mouth) earning $2k/month.

60246,106371,"For the ladies out there who have never been in a relationship or dating before, as a female myself (25 yo, NUS alumni), I want to share on some important notes before you start dating or a relationship.
1) Actions from guys are more important than words. Yes, a guy may claim he miss you, text you good morning, say will bring you you to xxx, say will do xxx. If they are just saying without any actions done CONSISTENTLY, then it is just plainly talking.
2) Please don’t accept a relationship just because you are afraid to be alone or already in the so called “typical age range to get married” or most of your friends are attached. Rather to be alone than to be in a relationship/marriage suffering!!
Side track: according to book I read, the most important things in life for a lady are:
A) Health
B) Own savings
C) Family and Females Besties (see guy is not in the list)
3) Watch out for his body language. If a guy CONSISTENTLY:
A) Keep his phone/phone screen away from you
B) Disallow you from using his phone
Explanation for A and B: he does that because he has something fishy to hide.
C) Never want to put your couple picture as his dp or post on social media or even discourage you to do so. Delete your couple photos on his phone.
Explanation for C: He considers himself to be in the “bachelor” market. Means he is still looking around for his partner or even scared of people seeing you two together.
D) Always talk about himself and rarely entertain you
Explanation for D: One sided. He only want companionship. There should be give and take.
E) Always online on WhatsApp/Telegram but take 10000 years to reply your messages
No need to explain you should know why.
F) Say “none of your business”.
This is a major red flag. In a relationship, you all are supposed to work and listen together, not one don’t care about the other.
G) Don’t know what he wants in a relationship. Even after months.
H) Flirting and Cheating. When someone flirted and cheated although he has you, it means that your relationship is not that strong enough to begin and typically he will not suddenly change his heart overnight. So please do yourself a favour to distance away from him. Why tolerate someone like that?
I) Always texting a lot of female friends. Go to female friends’ house alone and not with a group of people.
J) Not willing to fork out money for meals/trips on YOU. If a guy is cash stripped because of his family situation (eg. Take care of family/pay loan/debt), it is understandable. Otherwise, the typical guy will always have more than money to spend on you on meals. Imagine a guy having difficulties parting with his money at the dating stage/while in a relationship, and imagine if you were to have kids with him, he definitely want you to spilt/pay for the hospital bills and baby accessories expenses. Would you ever want that?
Side note: a typical guy will chat with more than one girl online/in person. Please keep your eyes open and don’t put 100% heart into the relationship unless you feel reciprocated. Otherwise you will get hurt.
4) I suggest ladies to watch videos from Stephanspeaks YouTube Channel (yes I am a fan of him). From his channel, I learned that a guy who truly wants to be with you would put 100% effort and his heart to be with you. He will be willing to spend money and time with you. No excuses. No mind games. You will be his priority other than his job.
Thanks for reading up to here :). I have been in the above situations blindly until I woke up finally. It has been very heartbreaking for me since I put my 100% heart into it. I cried alot and felt depressed and I am recovering from it now. At least I am thankful for recognising it at the start of the relationship.

60883,107720,"I am very conflicted about whether I should trust him again. 
I met this guy on a dating app and we hit off quite well. We really enjoy each other’s company and he seems to really care about me. After dating for around 4 months, he asked me to be his gf. However, i am not sure of my feelings for him, not because I don’t like him but because it is moving too fast. 
I told him not yet and he was quite annoyed. After asking for a few more times, he stopped. But we still go out quite frequently. 
One day, to my horror, when he was showing me something on his phone, I saw, on the notification bar, a girl name with some heart shaped emoji. I asked him who is that and he said it’s just a friend. I was not convinced but I try not to think too much about it. 
The following week, my friend told me she saw him and a girl at orchard road. She describes them behaving like a couple and I am sure there is something going on. I went to confront him about it and instead of apologizing for seeing another person, he blamed me for taking too long to decide if I want him. I was speechless and I told him I don’t want to see him anymore. 
I cried myself to sleep that night, a part of me wondered if my hesitation has caused him to cheat. But another part of me felt that if he really loved me, he would never have done that. He should have waited a bit more for me to be ready. But I was so confused and I felt so worthless because I can be so easily replaced. 
3 days later, he texted me to apologized about his words and actions. He invited me to the place where we had our first date and he told me I am the only one he loves and when he went out with the other girl, he was testing if he can have that same special feeling towards her. But he didn’t so, he ended things with her because he realized I am the one. He told me I hurt him when I did not agree to become his gf.
The date ended off quite well and I felt so happy that he is mine again. However, I am not sure if he can be trusted, but at the same time I don’t want to lose him again. 
I am very conflicted and I hope I can get some advice.

My dad absolutely detest ""useless"" (acc to him) people and this translated into our upbringing. He has been scarred by useless children of his rich business associates. Long story short, only 2 points are applicable to this story.
1. He will cut us off financially when we turn 21.
We can still stay at home rent free, but nothing else. We don't have to give parents monthly allowance coz acc to him, the amount is peanuts and he would rather we use it to be independent. If we retain and did not graduate uni by 21, too bad, we will have to pay the remaining school fees on our own.
2. If we are not 100% independent by 30, he will write us out of the will.
Independent means having our own home (rented or bought doesn't matter) and having enough money to feed ourselves.
As a results, I worked by butt off growing up, I chose not to go to uni to work earlier and ended up studying part time for my degree. I studied a course that I did not like, but it's practical. I bto-ed with my husband and now, before 30, we have our own house, kid and pretty good life. I sacrificed, did what was smart rather than what I liked, during my early 20s while my friends were enjoying ""uni life"".
My younger sister will be graduating uni this year (graduated actually). She chose her course based on ""passion"" and now have difficulties finding a job. She enjoyed her uni life a bit too much and took on a study loan when she turned 21, and delayed her graduation a few times. Therefore, now she has no money, in debt and no job. There's no way she will be able to fulfil the independence criteria by the age of 30.
She went back to ask dad for financial help. Dad refused at first and then said he can help only if I approve, as I followed the rules. Changing the rules halfway will be an insult to the hard work and sacrifices I made.
Should I give my approval?
PS, I decided against it. People need to know the consequences of their actions, especially if this has been discussed since birth.

I too once thought I found the love of my life. That we will live happily ever after. I was so in love all the advice I've heard before fell on deaf ears. Don't repeat my mistakes!
Someone once told me that the biggest reason marriages fail is because women think that men will change after marriages but they don't. Men think that women wouldn't change, but they do.
And boy do they change... Within a few years, I can barely remember the woman I loved. And I'm not just talking appearance - it's the personality changes that scare me. Even her family commented that she is so different.
The once caring, gentle girl who was the light of my life is now my nightmare. Everything I do or don't do is wrong. Everything I say or don't say is wrong. Every wrong step she will dig up things from ages ago and stack them up.
Other than the 3 kids we have and love dearly, we are worse than roommates. Every time I thought we made progress, something trivial will trigger her and it's worse than ever.

My grandfather used to have oil lamps, do I have to learn that? He drove a manual shift car? Should I learn that? Once he got sick and he picked some random wild plants from the side of the road and made tea out of it instead of eating his antibiotics. He died without having eaten a single pill that was prescribed to him by a Mount Elizabeth doctor. Should I learn that? 
There needs to be a system by which people pick and choose which aspects of our ancestors’ lives we ought to learn from. What is that system? Based on usefulness? What is the metric?

60873,107697,"Sorry long rant ahead. AITA for not wanting to pay for my mom’s new BTO? 
For context, I just recently graduated from NUS and is holding an average paying job of 5k a month. My mom is a single mom as my dad passed, and she has gotten a new BTO recently. She is working as an admin and earns about 3k monthly. As the sale proceeds of our current flat is not enough to cover the new flat, she wants me to top up the balance using my cpf as she thinks i’m capable since i’m working already. 
My mom has very traditional values. She didn’t explicitly say but is planning to give the house to my bro after he gets married as she feels is the male responsibility to provide a house for his wife. Similarly, she also expects my bf side to be able to provide a house for our marriage. However I told her this is not the case for Singapore as couples usually BTO. I have already successfully BTO-ed with my fiancé and is planning to save up to pay for my own house. 
She said i’m selfish for not offering my cpf to pay for her house but i told her it is not my responsibility to do so. It is also not my decision to buy a new house. I’m already giving her $800 a month as allowance, which i believe is higher than average as compared to the market given that she’s a single mom. But she still seems to be ungrateful and thinks that I SHOULD be giving her the money. 
Also, there are 2 rooms in the current house (3 room flat) so she gives one room to my bro and i share a room with her. I’m fine with it but my last straw was that she wants to invite my bro’s gf to move into his room while my bro is in the army, so that they can meet asap when my bro comes back from the army. My bro’s gf is not singaporean so she rents a room outside. I told her that this is unfair to me as i would like to have my own room as well, and she should offer the empty room to me to stay instead of his gf while he is in army. But she said since he is a boy he should have the room no matter what. 
After the whole fight she told me I am very selfish and told me to get out. I told her my BTO isn’t ready and my bf side also doesn’t have the conditions for me to move in. It’s so frustrating living together. 
Please let me know if I’m the asshole as she has already gaslighted me into thinking that I am one.

Would like to clarify that yes, I am definitely able to buy my own Gucci bags, even Chanel, LV, Rolex and whatever. But the point is, isn’t it much more practical to get the Gucci bag for proposal instead of a stupid bling (which he mentioned would be expensive but didn’t state the exact value), since I personally do not have a liking for diamonds. I don’t need to have an expensive ring for proposal. So what’s the point of him buying me an expensive ring for me (which I will seldom wear)? And I will have to spend another $2k on the bag when he could have just gotten me the bag and maybe a ring for proposal that cost less than a thousand? Isn’t it much more cost saving? 
What makes me rage the most is that, it doesn’t seem as though he is really saving for an “expensive ring” if he can turn down such a good deal of spending only $3k for a proposal.
As for myself, I don’t mind spending on the one I love, and I have bought him gifts like Sperry shoes, Fred Perry Polo tees etc on occasions. And my birthday? A small cake from him. Split hotel cost for staycation. I have mentioned that I understand he is a little stingy when it comes to money, and we have fought a few times over financial issues. Currently, we are also splitting on our dates even though he let me pay a little less. We have also come too far at this stage to breakup over our character differences, afterall we have already applied for flat 2 years back. 
I just felt that his reply was a red flag and I highly doubt he’s really saving for expensive ring like he claimed. 
We made an agreement to post this matter on this platform to see how the public will react to our different POVs. But ohwell, seems like most of the people think that choosing a cost saving method is wrong and my bf should dump me. So I guess I will be buying my own bag and wearing that “expensive” bling from him which I will be throwing aside after a few months of wearing it. Haha.

We have been together for a year. Mostly our relationship's a good one and we are happy. She is in general an independent person but almost paradoxically at the same time is very obsessed over me. She tells me almost everyday how happy I make her.
Roughly once every two months so far she will get unusually angry over something small like maybe a text message from me to her where the tone can be misinterpreted as being not nice. She will get so unbelievably angry that she will write me walls of angry text, then tell me she is breaking up with me, then block me so I cannot reply. Occasionally she will unblock to write angry messages to me again then block me again. About a week later she will call to apologize. I will talk to her about not doing the same again and we get back together. Cycle repeats.
It is particularly stressful for me because when she says she is breaking up with me and block me, each time I have no idea if it is for real. And each time I believe the same will not happen again because we take the time to talk about each incident in detail after it happens. I have no reason to suspect any trigger because besides these occasional events, the relationship is going well.
What can I do?
And the next time she blocks me and I have a panic attack, should I attempt to reach out to her?
