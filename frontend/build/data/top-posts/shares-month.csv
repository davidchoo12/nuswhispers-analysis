61226,108632,"Does anyone have parents like mine?
I just started working, salary 4k before cpf. Not living with them since 2 years back.
I wanted to give allowance, so I told my mom I would like to give her 10%, thinking that she will be happy you know, that I still thought of her. But then she was like, not happy, and said ""only ah""... which is kind of a downer tbh
then after that she started to send me online discussion threads on allowance, those people commented that they give 20% or more. She also likes to send those quotes that say ""Mom suffers the most and are the best"" ""There is no price tag on mom's love"", ""Mom worked so hard to put me through school, I will give my whole salary to make her happy"" something along those lines. 
She always sends them and say just sending for me to see, nothing much. Then whenever I reply, like to say dad also contributed or I did give you 10%, she will get upset and say she didn't ask for my replies. JUST READ DONT REPLY.
for context I have not taken a single cent of allowance since jc, even from part time jobs I earned through sch, also have been giving her allowance here and there. Uni was totally self funded.
She also says that she gave her own parents way more than 10% during her time, but bro that was when hdb and food were cheap... 
She always say she is very reasonable and very ok with stuff, but whenever money brought up she will mention 10% too little I very stingy, this auntie that auntie child give 25% etcetc. Can eat out and buy stuff but cannot give her the money. She is the perfect child and most filial, but I'm the stingy one. Always say she is just saying,  but she kept bringing it up and sending me those hints.
Am I gaslighted or 10% really too little?? Right now I'm giving 10% each, total 20% already, I feel quite reasonable tbh. I also have my life to build man. And I earn money, ofc I will save but can't I also spend some for my enjoyment?? What's the point of hogging money to the grave?

There is no playbook (that is published anyway) for what it takes to be successful in any organization.
Every organization is different. They are owned by different people, managed by different people, have different operating needs, have different goals etc. What your ""value"" is to a company is up to them—it is not up to you. I've read a lot of young people here just starting out in the real world, brandishing their spotless academic record like it is legal tender. Your academic record isn't worthless, but its worth isn't decided by you.
To be successful in any organization, you need to figure out what their system of merit is. YOU do not get to define what that system is. 
If you work for a company that you think has a failure-inducing way of making decisions, your best strategy to mitigate the various risks it could have on your career is to quit. The company’s potential failure is none of your business. Your job is to figure out how to succeed within that organization, not to whine when someone whom you think is inferior is promoted ahead of you. There’s always a chance that a mistake is being made, in which case it wasn't your company anyway. There is also a chance that you are not seeing what the decision-makers of the company are seeing, because (possibly) you're too caught up in the ""injustice"" of it all that you become blind to the idea that people ought to play the game by your rules. 
If you want to win the career game against your peers, it is in your interest to figure out what the rules are. If you claim to know what they are and your coworkers are advancing ahead of you, you clearly didn't know what the rules were. If you did you'd be winning.
I was disillusioned at my job for a very long time until I decided to drop everything and start my own business (data warehousing). I was a straight A student even through NUS (and Cambridge). Since PSLE I never missed a beat. When I started working I was frustrated when other people did better than I did. People were getting promotions, salary raises, big bonuses etc. I was doing moderately well but there were people who did not do as well as I did in JC or in uni who were doing 10 times better. I had to train myself out of my addiction to the salaryman's curse—i.e the idea that I'd do well the better I perform at tasks. 
I realize now that the world is a big place. People have natural skills that are helping them succeed in life that may not have helped them in school. There was this guy I met in Hwa Chong who was a grade A slacker but very sociable. He always had a ""Cs get degrees"" attitude. Today, head of sales at a global 500 company. Youngest in his company's history.
Helpful advice. Nobody cares about how well you did in school. I have a Cambridge MMath and the total number of people to whom I had to present this degree was 1 (my first job). When you graduate, actually graduate. Move on.
