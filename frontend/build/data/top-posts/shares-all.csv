44460,71670,"Today, I felt my heart properly break for the first time. The course I’m studying has quite a heavy workload so I haven’t been going home for the past three weeks. My father came to visit me today. He is rarely ever free and today is one of those days that he could make time.
My father is close to 70 years old and he is still not retired. He works as a cleaner at a country club during the day and holds another cleaning job at the community centre near my house at night. For some reason, he had half a day off today and he said he wanted to tour my hall. He came over and after showing him my room, we decided to get dinner at the Kopitiam at Kent Ridge MRT.
I know my father doesn’t have money so I offered to pay for his dinner. Guess what? The silly man ordered the cheapest thing he could find - fishball noodles. There was a lady (very well dressed, looks to be at least middle-class) infront of us in the queue and she left her chilli on the counter then walked away somewhere. My father didn’t see it and thought that that was an extra sauce so he just took it and put in on our tray. When the lady returned, she said very sarcastically that someone took her chilli while glancing up and down at my father. He immediately apologised and explained to her that we were not aware and that she could have her chilli back but she replied “你动过的我才不要。肮脏死”, which loosely translates into “I don’t want what you’ve touched. You’re dirty to death”.
This was when I realised that my father was still in his uniform. I almost screamed at this lady seeing as she was clearly younger than my father and was being rude. However, my father held me back and simply apologised again. He said that he’s used to it and it suddenly hit me that this is what he does all on a day to day basis. He apologises and lets people walk over him. He is invisible. I always knew my dad worked hard and is always at the mercy of others but seeing it with my own two eyes was an entirely different experience. I couldn’t even hold back my emotions and start tearing uncontrollably while we were eating. I had to lie that I was tearing because I got chilli in my eye but the truth is I was heartbroken by how my dad has to swallow his pride all the time.
I can’t wait for the day when I can tell him to stop working and stop apologising for everything. All my dad ever did was love and dote on me but everyone else has just been so awful to him. Dear rich people, what did we ever do wrong to you?

51354,86471,"Admins please don't filter this. My best friend's gf broke our friendship. I'm so upset. They've been together for 5 years, so what? I've known my best friend since last year, but I've always believed in 'bros before hoes' (ok I'm a girl but I believe in this case bros means friends).
Actually, the first time I saw my bestie, I fell in love with him. He's handsome and kind to everyone, so I tried getting closer to him in hopes that we can get together. But then after awhile I realised he had a gf so I thought ok, I just have to show him that I'm better than her then he will come to my side. I'm prettier than her, and we are both in nus while she's in some unknown uni. Thankfully he treated me as a close friend so he shared a lot about his gf to me and even the details of their dates, so I knew how to compete.
Then at the start of this year, HE TOLD ME HER BIRTHDAY IS ON THE SAME DAY AS ME SO HE CANT SPEND TIME WITH ME ON THAT DAY! They were gonna go to the zoo for the entire day. (This was before CB) i tried asking if I could tag along but he said no. Come on la. Gf only what, his best friend has the same bday as her doesn't mean he can neglect the best friend right. So I stopped texting him and gave him the cold shoulder. It worked and he told me ""let's have dinner together on your birthday instead?"". Ofc I said yes. He suggested amk hub food court. What the? But ok la, I said I wanted teppanyaki and he said sure. Finally I can feel like his gf for once.
The day came, and I realised his 'together' meant him, me and HIS GF. They got me a gift and said they shared price for it. Can't the gf find a gift to give me on her own? So low effort, share price. At the teppanyaki place I tried sitting between him and her but she moved to his other side. Cannot be apart for just awhile? I told him he should pay for dinner since it's our bday and he should treat us, but the gf offered to pay half of the total. A little sick of her efforts to please him at this point.
Then after dinner I asked if he wanted to walk me home, he said no because he and gf actually booked movie tickets and it was starting soon. So I asked him to buy me another ticket so I can join in but the gf interrupted and told me no very rudely. When she went toilet, he apologised to me and said they booked the couple seats last week so it's a little impossible to join. Who ask them book couple seats? They had one week to ask me and they didn't. I just left immediately. He tried to call me that night but I blocked him on every online platform.
After two days I unblocked him and sent him a long text about how his gf is too needy and he needs to spend more time with me, but the message was left on single tick. The next day I bumped into him in school and tried to say hi but he just walked off. Until now he isn't talking to me. 6 months already. I sent him a lot of texts but it's all one tick. I even tried texting his gf but same thing. I went to his house a few times but saw the gf shoes there so I left.
Is he overreacting? Am I overreacting? Is this friendship even worth it anymore?

50703,85226,"Sorry I just need to rant.. Recently my boyfriend bought me a Louis Vuitton wallet which costs around $700 for my birthday. When I saw the wallet, I felt really upset and disappointed. Because earlier this year, my sister's bf got her a Chanel wallet which costs at least $1000 for her birthday. Chanel is so much nicer than LV. Let's be honest, LV is for poor people who want to look rich. And during this CB, her bf always order food from more popular restaurants like Crystal Jade and Paradise Dynasty for her. But my bf only orders food from cheap restaurants like Swensen's and Ichiban for me. Her bf even gives her $1000 a month for her own spending. But my bf only gives me $500 a month. I hate to admit but I really feel very jealous of my sister because her bf is willing to spend money on her despite earning just $4k a month. My bf earns at least $5k and yet he is so stingy with me. Sometimes I really feel like a loser.. why my sister can find such a good bf but I just cannot. Just because she is taller and slimmer, she can find a good bf.. it's so unfair. Sorry for the long rant.

I used to think that my relationship is very stable before entering uni, however Guy A appeared in my life and made me reconsidered my original thoughts. Lately, I found out that I really love to engage in intelligent conversation with A, talking about all kinds of life issues and travelling experiences etc. On the other hand, my BF will only talk to me about boring and meaningless army stuffs that spark zero interest in me. He simply couldn't understand that I already had enough academic troubles on my plate. Worse of all, he cannot be there when I had emotional break downs . I'm glad Guy B was there to hug me to sleep when I needed emotional support the most. Although I'm a fan of swensen's and ajisen, that doesn't mean that I won't get sick of it. When I suggest to visit atas places for our anniversaries, my BF would always brush this topic aside by saying that we should save up for BTO, money is hard to earn blah blah blah...(Excuses). Sometimes I would rather stay at home then go out with him, there was once I cancelled a date on him and went to wave house with A. Compared to my BF, A is able to surprise me on every single outing.
Truth to be told, A did hinted to me that he had feelings for me but I don't want to promise him anything yet. As of now, I haven't cheated on my BF yet, I giving him one more year to change for the better.

We are all working adults now and 4 of my brothers can’t find their right one (they are middle age men now). I felt bad for them and asked my wife if she is willing to have sex with my brothers and have a child with each of them to boost their self esteem.
In which, she agreed. (With conditions like 100k for each child birth ) She then had sex with my oldest brother about 5 years ago. Which I have regretted this decision and really defeated every inch of my soul. I cried very badly outside their room that night. Since then she had sex with my 3 other brothers occasionally. I act like I am okay in front of them. But in fact it was killing me inside, each time they had sex.
Today, we each have one child. When I look at my brother’s child, I felt sadness and emptiness in my heart. I start to question myself “what if this child does better than my child”, “what if my wife likes this child better than our child, which cause an impact on our relationship”.
I start to think a lot since the start of the sex with my brothers, which really impacted my mental health a lot as I did not mention to them about my feelings as I do not wish to ruin our relationship, both brother and wife.
I started to have depression and have sucidal thoughts after one month my wife had sex with my oldest brother. Even though this is transactional, but I still felt really bad and felt that my self worth is worse than a bag full of dirt.
Today, when we go out as a family, me, my 4brothers, wife and 5 childrens. I felt very insecure and wish to die everyday. I do not know what is the point in living already. Btw the children all acknowledge me as the dad. As registered in the all their birth cert.
All in all, I do not know why I suggest such a stupid idea. And I really f regret it to the core of my soul.
Please advise how to cope with this… I don’t think I can tahan already

42009,66398,"Just ORD from the army last week with a LTA rank. I will be matriculating into NUS in Aug. I want to ask, how much does your former rank play in nus? Like for e.g. if you apply for some things they may ask of your past experiences. If I say that I was an officer in the army, how much of a benefit would I get over my peers?
Also, how is the culture like among peers in daily life depending on your former rank, for guys? For example if you were a men would you get looked down versus if you were an officer would your male friends show more respect to you? For e.g. if I were to apply for a CCA club president role, would people be more likely to vote for me if I say that I have more leadership experience in the army?
If the answer to all the above is “no”, can some fellow former officers who are already students advise what kind of other benefits can we expect to get in the university, including intangible ones, for those of us who were formerly officers?

41748,65932,"Hi everyone, I’m currently serving NS but I’ve been accepted to NUS so i hope it’s okay if i post my experience on toxic masculinity here. (Don’t worry it’s not an army-bashing post)
My parents, like most love me very much. They would always check up on my studies, ask if i need money when going out and gave their 110% to support me when enlisting (i.e calling me at night, picking me up from Pasir Ris, buying me snacks for the week). However, they had a shortcoming which only manifested itself after i POP-ed - Elitism.
I didn’t perform very well for my BMT which meant that i got a posting in a non-combat vocation, specifically a logistics quartermaster. So incase you weren’t aware, there are the 4 perceived “Hero” vocations that are seen as the most elite in the eyes of my parents - Guards, CDO, OCS(Not rly a vocation but status symbol nonetheless , NDU). When my parents were always going on about how I have to go to a “Hero” vocation and were absolutely crestfallen when they had heard about my posting. Connections were called and requests were written to various places (All behind my back).
And when those efforts proved fruitless, it was when i realised how toxic they could be when it came to my masculinity. I was berated for being in a 姑娘 vocation which was meant for “useless” people. They encouraged me to lie during family gatherings to avoid embarrassment. I had stopped receiving emotional support from them (Calls, rides, a simple “how was your day”). On days were i had offs or half days, i would be greeted with a “why are you home so early” rather than a welcome home. They would compare me with my cousins and ask why I was not able to live up to the standards of the family.
One time they said that i would not get any inheritance from them because a “姑娘” does not need money as she is not the breadwinner of the family. That last one really hit close to home as i have never, nor will i ever ask and pry about money let alone family inheritance so for them to think that I was eyeing their money was really heartbreaking to me.
They recently informed me that they won’t be attending my specialist graduation parade which was really what drove me to craft this post. Mum, Dad I love you both and should the time come, I would die for you. Is that not enough to constitute what a “man” should be.
Anyway I’m not here to ask for advice, I’m dealing with it on my own. I just wanted to let future parents know what I’m going through and should you have a son in the near future, I hope you guys won’t adopt the same mindset as my parents. It really hurts.

52430,88911,"My bf and I have a joint savings account. I'm a student while he's been working for two years so he's the only one contributing to the account.
A few months ago, a good friend of mine wanted to buy something expensive so she borrowed $700 from me. My personal savings account has very little money so I used money from the joint account to lend my friend.
My friend told me that she will return me the money by last month but she hasn't done so. I'm not surprised because she has a habit of forgetting to return money e.g. whenever we go out to eat, I would pay for the meal first but she would often forget to return me her portion of the bill. Although she is a mutual friend of me and my bf, my bf dislikes her because of this.
Today, my bf asked me if my friend has returned me the $700. When I told him that she hasn't returned, he asked me to remind her to return the money. I told him that it would be embarrassing to ask her to return the money. Thus, he said he can help me to ask her to return the money.
$700 is not a big amount so I don't understand why he is so determined to get the money back. Granted, that $700 comes from the joint account, which consist of his money. But since it is a joint account, the money inside also belongs to me. That gives me the right to do whatever I want with the joint account. If my friend really forget to return the money then so be it. I would just take it as I bought a $700 gift for my friend. No big deal.
I really hate that my bf is so calculating. Why would he even want to ask her to return the $700? It's not even a lot of money. I really hate guys who are calculating. Should I just dump him?

Whenever I request to eat something that is apparently not very comfortable to his wallet (not sure what that means), he will always insist we eat at a nearby foodcourt or hawker?
Firstly, places like that are usually very dirty and hot like why would I even consider dining there? The food's good but he brought me out for a date so I shouldn't even be expecting him to request us to eat there? Like it's a date and I barely get to see him because he only books out on the weekend.
Secondly, I prefer food that looks pretty so I can take Instagram worthy pictures of it and have my bragging rights?
Lastly, I don't want to be seen dressed up in a very cute dress while at a hawker? That doesn't look pretty to me anymore.
Even when eating out at a mall, I was obviously craving for pasta and of course I wanted Hoshino, but he could only offer to dine in at Saizeriya because it was cheaper for him. Wtf? I will never step foot into that restaurant knowing that is where all the poor people go to when they want to eat pasta and try to pretend they are atas, BECAUSE WESTERN IS EXPENSIVE. Eventually we did ended up in Hoshino, but he didn't order his food because mine was already $13 which is double of what is offered at Saizeriya in terms of price. Whatever, at least I got to eat what I wanted :). He then went home and cook Maggie for himself? How broke can anyone be? Don't get a girlfriend if you can't afford it, especially when you're in NS.

My bf’s family is very traditional, and insists that his wife takes on his surname. For me, that would mean changing my title to Mrs Gan, given that Gan is his surname. I find it problematic to have to take on my future husband’s surname in this day and age, but ironically there is an even bigger problem due to my given name. My informal english name that I gave myself is Nina. If you put my english name and my bf’s surname together, I’ll become the laughing stock of others.
My bf also agrees that such a combination is not ideal. He suggests that I change my english name since it’s not legally registered in my legal records. My suggestion is to instead drop the requirement for me to take up his family name. I’m not willing to give up my english name as I’ve used it for many years ever since my secondary school days. Now we’re stuck at this juncture with no one willing to give way. This really sucks.

43425,69443,"Amidst all the troll, relationship and faith-in-human lost confessions here, I'd like to share something positive, and hopefully encouraging. I just graduated from NUS this year, but it's only now that I feel ready to share my story.
I grew up in a single-parent family with my mom and little sister. Throughout primary school, I was doing decently well in school and my CCAs. We weren't rich, but we survived just fine as a family.
Everything changed during secondary school when my mom was first diagnosed with cancer. When I first heard the news, all I could think of was 'why me?'. It felt like god was being unfair towards me. I was not a saint, but I did my best to live my life honestly and did everything as right as I could. Yet, this had to happen to me. From then on, my life started to go downhill. I started skipping school, my grades suffered, mixed around with the wrong company, and committed petty crimes.
My mom had no idea all these were happening because half the time, she was in the hospital and my teachers avoid bothering her with these news because they do not want her to experience additional stress. But finally, I was arrested by the police for shoplifting. I could never forget the look on her face when I saw her while she was bailing me out. Beneath the wrinkles, paleness and tiredness on her face, her disappointment was apparent. She was weak, in a wheelchair and was supposed to go for her usual check up that day. But she missed it because of me.
I realised that I was being selfish the whole time. I realised that I was thinking about myself and my own suffering, without realising that my mom was the one who was suffering the most. Additionally, my sister was starting to be influenced by me because her teacher called me and informed me that she had skipped school without an MC or letter.
I soon picked myself up, took my N levels, and scored well enough to take the O levels. My mom's condition started to get better as well. I stopped hanging out with bad company, and my teachers helped by giving me tuition in their free time.
I took my O levels. I had the goal of going to a good JC. But it was my second last O level paper, when one of my teacher approached me after the end of the paper. She told me the news. That my mom had passed away while I was taking the exam. My whole came crashing down again.
With that news, I could not focus on my last paper the next day. I did not score well enough to go to the JC I wanted, and ended up going to Poly. My life, once again, went downhill. It felt pointless to keep trying. It felt like I tried my best to be good, yet life just was not fair towards me. And with my mom gone, I did not have the motivation to study anymore.
While waiting for the Poly semester to start, I went through one of my darkest period. I was contemplating death every single day. There were some nights when I was very close to going through with my suicide plan.
What got me out of it was during one of those suicidal nights, I entered my sister's bedroom to put a note on her desk. She did not hear not hear me coming in, and I heard what sounded like crying noise. You see, my sister never cried or showed much emotions. During my mom's funeral, there was no expression on her face. But that day, hearing her cry, I realised that she was hurting just as much as I am. And if I were to die, the pain I experienced would not just end with me. It's be transferred to my sister, and that was the most selfish thing I could do.
I started to have a new motivation in live. My sister. I pulled through poly, juggling with a part-time banquet job during the weekends. And just like that, I made it through poly, and into university because of my good grades.
We had some help from our relatives, but it was never enough for us. My sister needed school supplies, and I needed textbooks and to pay off my poly tuition fee. My social life was not the best, because I could not keep up with going out with the clique every week and spending money with them when they choose to eat pricier food. Fortunately, I made a few good friends who understood my situation. They always opt for budget options, or insisted on paying for me. One of them had a sibling who was studying in the same secondary school as my sister and was a year older, and he gave me his sibling's old textbooks, supplies and even school uniform.
There were times when I felt like I was going downhill again, but when I looked back at how far I came, I find the courage to continue on. From someone who was arrested for shoplifting, to someone studying at NUS.
This year, I finally graduated. I was not the best in my cohort, with only a second-lower class, but it meant a lot that I graduated.
On my graduation day, I did not attend the ceremony. Instead, I went to the place where my mom's urn was kept, in my graduation gown (I didn't care that people were staring), and stayed there while the ceremony was going on. That day was the closest I've ever felt to my mom. She always told me her biggest regret in life was not getting an education and did not want her children to meet with the same regret. I hope that wherever she is, she'd be proud.
Someday, I hope to go back to school and get a masters or phd. But for now, the best option is to find work first, because I want my sister to go through life a little more comfortably than I did. But someday, I'll make my mom even prouder.

54176,92481,"Today, my colleague confessed to me that she likes me. Together with three other colleagues, we had dinner at one of our colleagues’ house. After dinner, the five of us had some wine and chatted for hours. I then offered to send her home because she was slightly drunk and other colleagues stay too far away from her.
During the taxi ride to her house, she started laughing uncontrollably and then sobbing. She then suddenly confessed her feelings for me. I was taken aback but I tried to remain calm and explain to her that I have a girlfriend. She said she knows I have a girlfriend and she has seen her photo on my social media. She then asked me what I saw in my girlfriend and why I would want to date such a plain-looking girl. I felt really offended but decided to just ignore her. Admittedly, she is considered pretty as she does have a few admirers at our workplace. She’s also quite nice and helpful. But today, I feel disgusted by her for insulting my girlfriend.
Just a few days ago during lunch, I was chatting with another colleague and she was telling me how envious she was of my girlfriend for having such a good boyfriend like me. She was complaining to me about how stingy her boyfriend was because he rarely treats her to a meal. In contrast, I would often take my girlfriend to some nice restaurant. But honestly I never saw myself as a good boyfriend.
Even during gatherings with my girlfriend’s family, her mom and older sister were always saying how my girlfriend is so lucky to have found a great boyfriend. I feel flattered and happy to hear such words but I still think I’m just an ordinary guy.
The people around me always thought that my girlfriend is the lucky one to have found a boyfriend like me but honestly, I think I’m the lucky one. I met my girlfriend when I was in NS. She was a fresh poly grad, working in a big firm. During BMT, she would travel from Jurong West to Pasir Ris with me whenever I have to book in, and then travel back to her house in Choa Chu Kang. She would always offer to treat me to a nice meal at restaurants because I once complained about the food in camp.
When I was in university, she would always accompany me to the library because I wanted to study. No matter how bored and tired she looked, she would just quietly sit there for the whole day while I do my studies. I remember when my second-hand laptop was spoilt, she offered to buy a new one for me.
When I graduated and started going for interviews, she accompanied me to every interview and encouraged me whenever I failed my interview. And when I finally found a job, she bought me all the formal wear and my first ever brief case, which was super expensive. She said this brief case would be more suitable for me than my 4-year-old sling bag that I bought from Giant.
I remember I once walked past a shop selling expensive watches, I stopped and glanced at the watches, saying how cool those watches were. The following month, she surprised me with the watch I liked, which then became the second watch in my life, the first one being my Casio digital Army watch.
Every morning, she would travel to the CBD with me just to spend more time with me and then travel to her workplace in Queenstown. And every evening, she would wait for me at the cafe below my office while I OT until 9pm.
She works in a big firm but she doesn’t earn much. Probably an average poly grad pay. She never ever buy anything for herself. But she bought so many expensive things for me. She sews her clothes and shoes whenever they are torn. But she would buy clothes and shoes for me whenever mine gets old.
I’m not sure why everyone thinks that she’s lucky to have me. I’m damn sure I’m the lucky one and everyday I feel like I’m the luckiest guy in the world. And I don’t care if my colleagues think that she is just a plain-looking girl. In my eyes, she’s the most beautiful girl in the world. People may think that most guys are shallow and only care about looks. Actually, guys just want a girl who would be there for him.

At the start of CB, she told me that she was bored so I suggested that she can download ML and we can play together. When she ask me to play with her , I decline as I have my own squad mates to play with already so I told her that we will play next time. I don’t know how but she solo-ed and now she is at mythic 200+ points already.
I was impressed so I asked her how she rank up so fast and she told me that she asks her poly friends (almost all are guys) to teach her and played with her. I checked her Instagram and saw all the guys she always played with are handsome guys. Upon seeing this, I was angry and fought with her because she didn’t tell me that she played with so many guys and now she is just a few hundred points away from me. But told me that I played with girls too, but she didn’t mentioned anything at all, and told me that we should just take a break until phase 1 is over which is like probably in July??????
What do I do now??? What if she cheat on me over some guy in ML??? Help please.

56677,98584,"To those who felt that you are at the stage if talking about settling down instead of breaking up with your boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't seem to be the right one, trust me, it's never too late. It's better to break it off now instead of marrying the wrong one.
I am a 过来人. I was 28 (F) when I broke off with my then bf of 3 years. We already talked about marriage, applied for BTO, planned for our future wedding dates, etc. Everyone thought that we will definitely get married one day. But others don't see what's really happening between us. He is a smart guy, with high paying job and constantly given praises by people around him. Basically he is like the Mr Perfect in everyone's eye. He was the one who chased me. When we first got together, we felt like we complement each other. Eventually, it started to become me chasing after his perfection. Like because he is this perfect, I need go be as perfect. And no, he didn't tell me it is ok to be who I am cause that's who he really loves, he expects me to be as perfect as him. He finds me watching drama, reading blogs all these as wasting my time away (PS: I only do it once I'm done with my work). He always talk on the phone about work and when I commented that I didnt get enough attention from him, he said at least he is doing something that earns money and not laze around. But I was in love. Afterall, he is the Mr Perfect and everyone tells me how I should not lose him. Then it started to take a toll on my mental health, crying to sleep everynight cause I felt like I was never good enough. I communicated the issues with him and he didn't feel like he has any wrong. Eventually, we decided to go on our separate ways, and gave up on our BTO.
The rs was so painful that it took me 2 years to decide that I need to start opening my heart again. Went on some dates (dating app) and went on a few dates with those I thought we have chemistry when talking via app but ZERO chemistry when we met irl.
At 33 years old, I met a guy via mutual friend. We hit off instantly. I really enjoyed talking to him. He is not perfect.. not well educated, earn less than me, slightly shorter than me, few years younger than me. To put it bluntly, people would say he ""pick until gold"" if I ever agree to be his gf. I shared with my friends that I was interested in him and none of my friends felt that we can work out cause he is too different from my previous Mr Perfect style. But I went ahead to agree to be his gf within one month after knowing him.
And fast forward, I am 37 year old now. He proposed to me after we were together for only 3 months cause he felt like I am the one for him, just as how I also told him I felt like he is the one for me. We got married 10 months after getting together. We are going to celebrate our 3 years wedding anniversary soon and our first son came out just last year.
Couples can be together for 10 years and still breakup while couples who are tgt for 10 days could meant for ever. Length of rs does not determine how successful the rs will be. It could be 10 years old quarrel or 10 months of working towards being one. So it is never too late to break up with the wrong one. I thought I was gonna be single for life but my soul mate appeared when I was no longer looking. It may be late but it's better than suffering all my life being with the wrong one.
Don't ever decide your life based on society norms. Do what you think is best for you and your mental health. Ask yourself what makes you happy and do all the happy things when you are single. Share those happy moments when you meet your future soul mate down the road and eventually share more happy moments when you find the one.
Jiayou!

It's settled."" Unfortunately, his outstretched arm featured a ginormous ARMPIT STAIN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Not only that, on my first day when I passed a comment worrying about whether I will pass probation, he knocked his index finger against my forehand and was like, ""Silly girl. You have me.""

51275,86352,"I'm starting to lose interest in this girl I met from Tinder after realising she only has 1k IG followers. So I am still confused as to whether I should even give her a chance.
So what happened was I matched with this girl on Tinder. She is my type, pretty, nice body, educated, decent job, outgoing personality. So we hit it off quite well and our convo moved from Tinder to texting. We would text daily, and sometimes even video call at night. I really enjoyed our convos and felt we had great chemistry.
After about 2 weeks, I decided to ask her for her IG. To my surprise, she only has 1,000+ IG followers! And she is following 800+ people. Means majority of her followers are just her friends. She barely has any fans and her IG is public some more.
Now, I am someone who has always pride myself on only dating influencers. I myself have around 10k followers. I've had 4 ex-girlfriends before, their IG following ranged from 10k to 80k.
Like it or not, your IG followers is a reflection of how attractive you are. Cos if you are hot, confirm will attract followers on IG. I myself am quite a catch, which is why I managed to get 10k followers even though I don't post very often also. So since I am considered the cream of the crop, I will also only want to date girls who are the cream of the crop. My friends have also always admired me for being able to date all these highly coveted girls.
So I must admit this new Tinder girl became less attractive in my eyes when I found out she only has 1k followers. I started to become a bit distant but the more cold I become, the more hot she become which makes me feel guilty like maybe I should give her a chance? Plus, my previous relationships all failed because when you are dating IG famous girls, you need to deal with a different set of issues like jealousy, insecurity, cheating etc.
But at the same time, I can totally picture my friends judging me for lowering my standards by dating such an average girl. I mean you go to pre-covid Orchard Road anyhow throw stone will probably hit some girl with only 1k followers. Plus I get invited to Media/PR events quite often. Can you imagine how embarrassing it will be if I bring this girl there with her 1k followers? I will also feel so embarrassed to tag her in my IG if we really end up together. Like my followers will prob go see her IG and realise I have really downgraded from 80k to 1k.
This tinder girl wants to meet after Phase 1 is lifted. Should I give her a chance knowing that I am definitely the more attractive one? Any advice from people who dated someone who is in a lower league and didn't regret it?
P.S: Please don't be hypocrites and troll this post. I'm sure all of you follow hot people on IG who have no idea you exist. My salary is quite average but I can assure you I get more girls sliding into my DMs than high earning investment bankers.
P.P.S: Please don't give me bs about inner beauty vs outer beauty. They are not mutually exclusive. Apart from my 3rd ex, my other 3 exes were super kind and nice girls.

56278,97257,"I am a 35/M and I went to a top secondary school and JC in Bishan.
I grew up around teenagers who prided themselves on their academic performance, on their CCA performance, and believed strongly that they will become highly successful people in the future. I had 2 classmates in JC, now best friends, who told me that they will hit a million dollars in annual salary by the time they reach 35, both of whom went to Oxbridge. Every single straight-A type that I knew had this air of arrogance around them, because I truly believe that they believed that they were better than the rest of us, that they will unerringly turn out to be more successful than any of us.
There was this girl I met in J1. She was a quiet girl who was from a neighborhood secondary school who happened to be in the same OG and class as I was. She was really timorous, really shy. She didn't have the best grades, and was notorious for skipping CCA. I was always confused by how nonchalant she was about schoolwork, how she always copies my homework, and how I have never once seen her studying. She eventually retained, and I lost contact with her.
I was recently having coffee alone at a cafe. She was fiddling around with the POS system. I recognized her immediately because she looked exactly the same as she did in JC. She did her hair up the same way. I approached her to say hello, and she told a younger girl to make her a flat white, and she came to sit with me at my table.
We started chatting about the old days, and I found out she got BCCC/B at A-levels, and did business at SMU. It also turns out that she owns the cafe, along with 13 other F&B establishments in Singapore and JB. Her share of the profits in 2018? 2.7 million. I was speechless for a while. Meanwhile my friends who went to Oxbridge, one of whom on a PSC scholarship, are now civil servants, both earning just a little between 10-15K a month. That's a good salary, but I was mediocre in JC (ABBC/A) and even I am earning more than 15K as a management consultant.
We have created a system of flawed meritocracy where children are brought up believing that just because you are the best in school, you're always going to be best in life. The logic is flawed because being the best in school just means you're going to be ""good"" in life. In most cases, you're just as likely as anyone to become ""great.""
If we think about it, kids become great in school because they understand the system well, and because there is generally a very clear methodology to become great. As long as you don't challenge the system, as long as you work within the ""rules,"" you'll come out on top. In the real world, there are several lines of work in which it is valuable to be able to work well within a system. The SAF for example. Probably explains why the word ""scholar"" always gets paired up with ""general"" in Singapore.
I think we, as a nation, need more humility when we think that the best people in school deserve more praise than any other student. People are good at different things, and school, being able to follow instructions to the hilt, is just one thing.

40227,63311,"Honestly, what's with the recent truckload of guy having to pay for girl and all that bullshit.
My story - Singaporean girl here, met husband in NUS. After 1 yr of dating, we decided that we were serious abt our r/s and started discussing plans for our future (marriage, kids, pre wedding photoshoots, honeymoon etc). We knew we needed a lot of money to make things work and we weren't rich. So while all our peers were partying away, going on couple holidays/staycay/getaways and grad trips; we were there giving private tuition and working our asses off during summer hols. We set up a joint account where we would contribute our hard earned money in. Of course, we had our own personal accounts but it weren't significant. We would scrimp and save wadever we can to make our dreams work. At e start of our r/s, we went dutch with the occasional presents for each other. After confirming that I'm the one for him, he decided to pick e tab most of e time (I'd insist on paying sometimes if its too expensive). As a result, I understand that he will not have much savings compared to me. Yrs later. He grad a yr earlier than me but didnt managed to get a job immediately. As such, he took up waitering temporarily to earn some money - determined to marry me when I grad.
When I grad, I got a job immediately, earning more than him (even after he changed job from waitering to desk bound). I paid for all our dinner dates. Our wedding - we copaid for our rings, our banquet, our local and overseas pre wedding photoshoots and our honeymoon. Many of our frens were shocked as to how we did it in e year of my graduation; thinking we had financial help from our parents when we did not. Its amazing how 2 of us even saved at least 250k before e age of 30.
Fast forward till today. We own a condo and have children of our own. I paid double e amt my hubby paid for our condo but I don't draw the lines with him and say hey, you're the man, you're supposed to pay for that roof over my head or I don't wanna marry you. Nah. We work tgt as a team. We support each other when we can. And now when I'm no longer working to care for our children, he pay for all the bills to support our family.
Moral of e story is - if you love somebody wholeheartedly and see a future with them, work tgt as a team. Make it work. Don't be so calculative. Dreams take flight when you work tgt, not thrash each other.

58807,103530,"tl;dr: I cheated with my female colleague and I feel very bad about it. What made it worse was that my wife witnessed the cheating…
I'm happily married with a wonderful wife with two kids. I work in marketing in an FMCG company and I'm constantly surrounded by younger female colleagues. Ngl, many of them are very attractive but I'm a faithful man who thinks with his bigger head.
However my life recently turned upside down. There's this female colleague who recently joined, let's call her G. G is in her late twenties and has a face and figure many women would die for and many men would go for. I was so surprised to find out that she was single (she gave me that information without me asking). G would constantly ask me for advice dealing with work matters and invite me to go lunch together with her batch. Sometimes we go for lunches and it's just the two of us. G would constantly ask me what I was doing over the weekend and tell me what her plans were. She was actively using dating apps but none of the guys were up to her standards. She would often flirt with me (I think?) Like when we are alone she would playfully brush my arms and sometimes bump into me (too often for it to be by accident). She’d also tell me about her experiences with her dates and how they're not good, and I'm so much better. I always felt a weird sensation whenever I hear that from her. It’s a nice feeling to be validated, but I’m married and it feels wrong.
One fateful day, as my wife had to use the car that day, she came to my office to pick me up. As I was walking away from the office with my wife, G somehow appeared out of nowhere and said hi to us and was extremely friendly towards my wife. G and my wife started chatting as if they were besties and they somehow ended up organizing a games night at my place that weekend. G said she’d bring her date over.
Fast forward to that day, G came with her date. Not sure why but I felt a tinge of jealousy seeing him. We decided to play some card games and I ended up partnering with G. This is when things went down. G was secretly texting me the cards she had in her hand and signaled me to read my phone. I got the hint and was trying to discreetly look at my phone. However, my wife caught me doing that and snatched my phone away and she saw the message from G. She acted like it was ok but after G and date left, she was so furious that I cheated with G during the games and my wife refuses to talk to me now.
How can I appease my wife?

55182,94643,"Tldr: Just broke up with my fiance whom I share a joint account with. Am I the asshole for asking for 100% of the money in our joint account because I think he should compensate me for my time wasted on him?
I have been dating my fiance for 3 years and we have been working for 2 years since graduating. He proposed to me last december and since then, I have been asking him to plan for our wedding, which I would prefer to be held as soon as possible because I am tired of working and want to be a housewife.
He told me he would prefer to have the wedding next year because he needs some time to plan the wedding but I want it to be held preferably by end of this year. Since he has agreed to stay at my parents’ house after marriage then there shouldn’t be any issues at all.
I just cannot understand why he wants to wait until next year to have the wedding because actually I was asking for a very simple wedding. I only wanted to invite our friends and relatives to a dinner at a mid-tier hotel like Pan Pacific and to get very affordable wedding bands like Cartier. He certainly can afford them because he has $30k in his personal savings account and he earns $5k a month.
I’m not even asking for much because I know there are way more expensive places to hold a banquet and way more high-end jewellery brands to get wedding bands from. But he thinks that the wedding bands and hotels I chose are too extravagant even though I have offered to help him pay 20% of all expenses. Because of all these issues, we quarrelled a lot and eventually I decided to break up with him because I realise he’s a very selfish person who doesn’t even care about what I want at all. Even the engagement ring he got for me was a small 0.9 carat which cost only $9k although I have specifically told him that I wanted a 1.5 carat.
Now that we have broken up, we are in the midst of discussing how to split our joint account money and he said he will give me half of the money inside, which is only $10k. His excuse for giving me only half of the money is that he was the only one contributing to the joint account. He did contributed to 100% of the joint account but I was the one who encouraged him to save up. Whenever he wanted to buy useless things like Nintendo Switch, I stopped him from buying them. Without me, he wouldn’t even have savings at all. Moreover, I wasted 3 years of my life on him so I think I deserve more than $10k. Honestly, even if he gives me all the money, which is merely $20k, I still don’t think it’s enough to compensate for the 3 years. But he seems reluctant to give me 100% of the money and kept giving me all sorts of lame excuses. Should I continue to ask for $20k or should I just settle for $10k? I’m so tired of fighting over this.

Just like some of you, I did not believe in the severity of this virus, believing that ""aiya won't so suey one lah"". I let my guard down.
I grandmother is 95 this year. She is in China right now. Just 6 months ago, she had a knee surgery as her knee shattered after she fell from her seat. So my filial parents decided to go back to visit her. Worrying about the situation, I made sure they have sufficient mask to wear mask, use hand sanitiser whenever they touch something. (I did not hoard. Just 1 box of mask so enough for them to last for 14 days)
Unfortunately, one of my parents and my grandmother has been infected thru an irresponsible and reckless relative. This relative still goes out to party with her friends because to her ""为什么你们这么怕死！我这么多朋友都没有中。不会有事的。我会注意的。不要烦我。我出去一下而已"" Yeah u knw. Just the typical rebellious youth... So what if she's apologising non stop right now? So what if she's feeling sorrowful and guilty right now? Is it going to cure my parent and grandmother? No.
I had a video call with my parents. In the call, my mum was telling me what I should do to keep myself safe, how to take care of myself and my younger siblings at home, telling me to stop playing games and sleep early. Just like usual, she's nagging me. Just like usual, I replying ""anah anah"". I sensed smth was wrong when my mum started to tear and cough ... It was unlike my mum who always shout and acting like a 母老虎... My biggest fear has came thru...
""你要照顾好自己，家里的衣服要洗。记得要买吃的。别每天把零食当饭吃。要保持健康和卫生。知道吗？妈咪不知道什么时候才可以回来。也不知可不可以回来了... 爸爸没事。爸爸在家。别哭了... 妈咪会没事的 。我还有我可爱的三个宝贝在家等着我呢。我会没事的。可以拍你弟弟妹妹的照片来给我看一下吗。先别跟他们说，他们还小，不懂事。他们读书不会的，你当哥哥的就要教他们。好了 不说了。你去洗脸。家里就需要你。我累了。我需要去休息了。乖。我爱你们。""
To make things worse, my father is diagnosed positive too...
Can you imagine u receiving a call from your parents and it turns out they're telling you their last words?
Can you imagine in just the next few weeks, you are going to become an ophan?
I regretted so much for not stopping them and cancelling their flights. I regretted not cherishing them well when they were still at home with me. I took you all for granted. I took health for granted. I cannot even fly to u all... I may not even be able to see u all 1 last time... I may not even be able to hold a funeral for you all...
I have been so frustrated with so many of you. I posted my stories on IG and FB but due to the lack of friends, I did not garnish much attention. Probably due to the fact that I'm from China? Some of u may even start trolling and say ""who ask ur China to eat bat 1st"". Worse is that these people are the ones probably still going out and complaining ""walao eh. Now everywhere close. No where to go liao. I never meet friend will die one leh.""
You haters gonna be like, ""wah watch too much drama. Hong Kong? Taiwan? Pls give this person the best #fakenews of the year""
Thanks to yall irresponsible fckers, my grandmother is not going to fulfil her dream of hosting her 100th birthday.
Thanks to yall, my siblings and I are officially orphans now.
Thanks to yall, 1st April will not be a day to have pranks.
Thanks to yall, I have to Google on how to process my parent's death certificates.
Thanks to yall, I will now have to become a brother, a student, a parent and a part-time work to put food on the table now
I'm not asking for sympathy. I'm not asking to hear ""my condolences""
I'm asking for you all to PLEASE FKING STAY AT HOME AND CHERISH YOUR LOVED ONE. Becus u may not know when they will be gone... I don't even have the chance to touch their warm bodies again...

56752,98792,"For those who are considering joining the real estate industry as a real estate agent; PLEASE I urge u to think twice. Especially if you’re leaving a stable salaried job to do this.
Don’t be fooled by the posts of your friend posting their awards & fancy cars and shit on social media and think it’s so easy. It’s not.
Don’t get brainwashed by the managers who are trying to recruit you that it’s such good money and that you can also do it. They earn an overriding commission from their team members so of course the more the merrier. My team manager makes $30-60k a month alone on his team overriding commission; and that’s on top of his own sales. Don’t forget that these people are highly skilled salesmen who can sell ice to eskimos.
The reality is that only the TOP 1-5% of ALL agents make good money & the rest are barely making it. I am not exaggerating. The people in the Top 5% are making all the money.
If you’re not in the Top 5%, u can totally forget about it. There’s over 30,000 agents in Singapore- u do the Maths.
In my first 2-3years, I burned through all my hard earned savings on PropertyGuru credits (I think burned about 5k), various training courses (3k here and 6k there), various apps & misc expenses.
Besides PropertyGuru, there’s also EdgeProp & 99.co- also need to buy credits.
Another 20-30k burned on Facebook & Google Ads.
In this industry you will burn a lot of money first (easily 20k or more in your first year) before u even make your first cent.
If you do not have at least 12 months of expenses saved PLUS min $20k for all these necessary expenses, don’t even consider it.
That’s not the worst part. Just because u burn money on PropertyGuru, Facebook & Google Ads doesn’t mean u will get genuine leads.
95% of all your leads are time wasters. They don’t respond when u contact them. Msg never reply. Or they will make appointment with you & then never show up. A lot of people who fill up your lead form on Facebook are just bored and have no genuine intention to sell or buy property. Cold leads from online marketing are almost impossible to close. Most of them are just “look see only”. I spent over $20k to learn this the hard way. Don’t be like me.
I cannot tell u how many times people have flown my plane. I travel down to the location and waited for an hour & the person never show up.
If you’re a woman, you’ll constantly get harassed by nuisance calls and texts by random male strangers. Because our contact number is readily available online, many men will think it’s okay to take your number and abuse it freely. Pretend to be a buyer interested to buy property, and then after wasting your time for hours, ask if you’re single.
Everyday I will get at least one dodgy text or DM from some creepy anonymous male stranger on various platforms. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
This year after deducting expenses, not only did I not make any $$, I lost around $15-20k.
It’s depressing to think that the people working in McD & cleaners actually earn more than me.
The truth is- You’ll HATE the job UNLESS you’re a natural salesman who genuinely loves interacting with people. The key words being “GENUINELY LOVES”.
I am an introvert, I hate going out, I hate interacting with people in general and I suffer everyday in this job.
So please take my advice. Don’t do it. It’s very painful & not as lucrative as many people think.
Most agents make around $50-100k a year? Might as well stick to a regular day job with CPF and benefits.
The real perk is the security of knowing u have a fixed paycheck coming in every month.
The dumbest thing one can do is leave a stable salaried job for this fucking “job” where U actually have to pay money to do shit U hate & talk to people u can’t stand, everyday going around for viewing after viewing after viewing like a free fucking tour guide.
People don’t care about wasting your time, cos you’re just an agent.
Nobody will tell u this shit because frankly those who are struggling won’t admit to anyone they’re struggling, and the few who are doing very well won’t understand why you’re struggling.
I just wish somebody had told me this shit years ago.

42039,66444,"TLDR ; Mobile legends zoned.
I got to know this girl through playing mobile legends. At that time, i was sourcing for a squad or active players to play rank games together through facebook pages. She's an extrovert, in contrast to me, an introvert so i enjoyed her company alot. She's also very cheerful and very well liked by people around her.
We would meet up often under void decks or malls to play ML together. There were also late nights whereby we will discord and play till early morning. I started to develop feelings for her and I felt like we were already an item. She would report to me where she was going and call me when i am not online on Mobile Legends.
This continued for more than half a year when i finally felt i had the courage to express myself to her. I purposely MIA for the whole day so that she would call me. And, at around 1am, i finally got the call i was waiting for. I picked it up and told her how much i liked her and i wouldn't want to see her with any other guys.
Unlike any other love stories, she just said, i was nothing more than a ML friend that brought her to mythic. And that was how my world fell apart again.

56799,98938,"Dear Prof. Ben,
Since you went to RI, I’m sure you would have gotten to know some classmates/schoolmates who have now become wildly successful in their careers. And by wildly successful, I do mean very wealthy. I also don’t mean the punch-cards who are working upper-middle class jobs, being paid upper-middle class wages. I mean those who are being paid millions a year, or entrepreneurs whose businesses are making millions a year in profit.
Since you were probably at the top of your cohort, do you secretly wish that you “deserve” more success than you have now? Or that they don’t deserve the wealth they’ve accumulated for not being as smart (or as hardworking) as you were in high school or in college?
I ask this question because I went to Hwa Chong and I was among the top of my cohort. I pursued academia at first, because it was what I was really good at (just generally learning stuff deeply). I dragged my ass through grad school and ended up doing dead-end research for 5 years before I started a job in the industry (CS) where I was paid the same as people 10 years my junior, doing work that to me, is in all sense of the word—stupid.
I have some ex-classmates who are now living in detached houses around Bukit Timah, driving luxury cars, one of whom was a middling student who used to copy my homework (he was smart just lazy). Almost every one of my crazy-rich ex-classmates are business owners, none of whom were particularly talented back in Hwa Chong.
Maybe wealth doesn’t mean much to you, but I was hoping you could help me reconcile being one of the smartest person in school and now having to capitulate to the reality there’s little profit in being so academically-inclined.

59741,105341,"I would like to share my eye opening experiences for the last six months working as a casual worker and the state of how said group of labourers are perceived.
Background info: I come from a privileged background and work for my family business for the last ten years or so after graduation. I haven't been exposed to much hardship with the exception of National Service and a bit of racism in my studies abroad. About 9 months ago, I had a major tiff with my family regarding the direction of our business and we decided that it would be better for me to take time off to collect myself and find my way. It was fun at first to bum around but it got boring quickly.
I read quite a bit and was awed by Einstein's experience as a patent clerk giving him new perspectives and decided to do something similar. I decided to take on any form of casual jobs for half a year with little to no commitment (so I can have the largest possible variety) - my shortest stint was one day and my longest was two weeks.
I gave myself a couple of rules to follow - no using of my car, limiting my spending to 20% of my daily wage, and not to quit no matter bad or tough the job was.
I found these jobs on FaceBook - a cornancopia of opportunities in various casual job groups.
I have worked as a food delivery rider, parcel delivery staff, pet transporter, mover, flyer distributor, general cleaner, IT crew, fishmonger, metalwork crew, AV crew, F&B staff, bar hand, food packer, warehouse operator, aeroplane cleaner, valet driver, durian opener, and a few more jobs.
It has been an eye opening experience working. The main things I noticed is that a good percentage of locals adopt an elitist mentality. Unfortunately, my family is guilty of this and to some extent, I too was. Most are very judgemental of blue collared workers and this is very prevalent in the F&B industry.
Toughest job: Metalwork crew. I had to cut metal objects to salvage profitable parts and it was extremely dangerous with sparks flying and a very dirty environment.
Most enjoyable job: Fishmonger. This was by far one of the most fun I had working as I learned to scale and cut different types of fish. It was also very interesting to work at the fisheries to see all sorts of fish(small ones to huge ones almost half a tonne).
Most interesting job: Valet driver, I witnessed plenty of older married men needing to be sent home/hotels with much younger women. Some of the dross these men say/do with their women in the car have definitely left a mark on me.
Most boring job: Warehouse operator, pretty mundane with too much repetition.
My experience as a bar hand watching guys trying to impress their dates is quite hilarious - I notice guys love to flaunt their wealth when it isn't really great in the grand scheme of things. They tend to treat the bar hands and service staff like crap to look more alpha I'm guessing? Terrible viewing.
Other 'interesting' experience include deliverying parcels to women who receive them not wearing underwear and being pretty nonchalant about it.
Distributing flyers/assisting and moving furniture from showflats to showflats for realtors was a jaded affair - I notice they tend to spew a lot of drivel to the prospective clients with little to no real knowledge about investments as a whole and only seem to care about making a quick buck. Males tend to be nicer to us, offering to buy food if we had worked the whole day without breaks. Females tend to be a bit more picky about not wasting flyers on seemingly unqualified prospects - very judgemental.
Working as an IT crew for tuition centres was pretty sad - I realised a lot of tutors are not really proficient and pretty much reading off their notes. I even noticed a few making mistakes in their lessons - quite alarming.
Cleaning flats and offices was.. peculiar. Some flats were really disgusting and I could not believe people are capable of being so gross and not able to pick up after themselves. Especially tenants moving out, woah. Some flat owners were really nice with isotonic drinks and snacks but the office ones were generally curt and snobbish. A typical HR who was in charge of us(usually middle age woman) would treat us as lesser beings and treat us as such.
Generally, people are quite condescending about lower waged workers and I even saw a few former JC mates brushing me off or being unnecessarily difficult in my experience in F&B. Thankfully, with the mandatory mask, I was never once recognised or questioned. I hope we will be a bit more gracious to people of all sorts of life - no one deserves to be belittled.
Transporting pets was truly amazing, I learned so much how the shelters are in need of help and how these animals truly need our help.
Overall, I made about $12000(close to $10/hour) in these six months and after my daily food and transportation expenses I had about $9000. I have donated this amount to the few shelters and will continue to do so.
I have learned so much for these six months that will echo for the rest of my life and have realigned my perspectives of how I should look at people and my family's firm.
A good two weeks break to decompress and time to get back to bringing our business forward and being a positive member of society.
AMA and I will do my best to reply in a follow-up post.
Always choose to be kind and gracious, it costs nothing.

32767,51313,"#51306 When I was an undergrad in NUS a few years ago, I used to spend <$8 a day for all my 3 meals. Most of the time, it was $1 pau for breakfast, $3 cai png for lunch and $3 chicken rice for dinner. To get by, I used my NS savings and did full-time/part-time internships. My course was 4 years but I couldn't afford to waste another year so I did 6-7 modules every semester to graduate 1 year earlier and not pay the extra course fee. Back then, I was one of the few who did not even own a data plan (costs $42 a month), because that was too expensive. I only started using a smartphone when I was in year 2? I think that was the year M1 had some smartphone rental with a $15-20 plan, at the end of 2 years, you had to return the phone.
My course was CS, and to be honest, it wasn't easy. I wasn't the brightest student, my PSLE score was only 133. But I am sure as hell going to work my ass off. While it took others 20 hours to complete Dr. Steven Halim's practical assignments, it took me a week. That plus a few software engineering projects in other modules, plus my internship commitments, I barely had any time left to sleep.
Through it all, one thing remained constant in my life, I, absolutely, completely, love computers. There is something about the way we put 0s and 1s and organize it into beautiful 3D graphics or complex data models, makes me fall in love over and over again. It's like an endless orgasm. Ha ha.
My point is, it kinda sucks sometimes to see others driving their father's car, texting on their pretty iPhones and drinking Starbucks, but let's face it, life is unfair. It will never be fair. Not today, not tomorrow, not a million years from now.
So what if others have a ""better"" life than you? It is all in our minds. We should do what we love to do and be thankful for the little things in our life....
Your mother yelling ""AH BOY!!"", ohh what a beautiful sound. The sweet smell of burning hell notes during 7th month. Church bells ringing early in the morning. Old man at TPY playing the harmonica. All these things are so wonderful it makes my heart throb for joy.
We are in Singapore. We have relatively good infrastructure, no natural disasters, corruption-free (or haven't caught yet) government. Our hawker food is cheap & good. The weather in Singapore is wonderful. There is no snow, so we don't need to pay for heating bills. It is hot, but you can go to the library or shopping mall for free aircon. Alternatively, you can mediate and not sweat in the slightest. Water is clean too. Our kids are in school. The adults have jobs. Everyone can get a house even if it is just for 99 years. Students are not rioting but debating online.
TLDR; Life is unfair. It will never be fair. Live and let live.

He is always by my side whenever I feel depress, cheering me up with magic tricks. Although he knew that I'm already attached, he continued to shower me with affection and love. Instead of rejecting him, I led him on by asking him to hug me when I'm sad. Kiss him on the cheek when he sent me back home. (Well, as long as I didn't engage in sexual activity with him, I'm not cheating on my bf) .
I did clearly explained to him that, there is a very low probability of me becoming his gf. However, he gave me a shocking reply that touched my heart deeply and brought me to tears. Although he knew that he has little or no chance, he is unwilling to abandon a vulnerable girl like me. He wants to stay by my side to protect my fragile heart until the day I no longer needs him. When that day arrives, he will cut all contacts from me in order to nurse his emotional wounds.

While I appreciate the efficiency of transferring the $$, I was upset that he did not transfer $21 instead? To put things in context, I was brought up being taught that if my friend paid for smth which costs let's say $2.70, out of courtesy for his/her service, return $3. Basically my parents said to round up instead of being calculative to the CENTS.
It's not that I want to EARN his 3cents. We are both working adults in our late 20s with more than enough savings. However I never thought that he was the nitty gritty type. We have only been dating for a few months, so I probably haven't seen all sides of him?

57717,101452,"I am a 19F local dating a China guy with a really curious trait. Whenever he has trouble remembering how to pronounce cheem-sounding English words, he will transliterate it into Chinese and memorize that instead. For instance, ""s**ual intercourse"" becomes ""谁输儿 阴特扣死“ (shei-shu-er yin-te-kou-si), which I find so funny I make him say it every time he wants to do it.
But yesterday when I was helping him to spring-clean his room for CNY, I stumbled upon this army notebook of his. I recall that he told me as a second-gen PRC he had to serve, and he was a Platoon Sergeant, so I was curious and had a look at what he wrote. Lo and behold, it was full of Chinese transliterations of army commands and on one page, there was a full-blown Tang dynasty-esque poem:

I am in married, female, and in my 40s. I had a very traditional asian father growing up that believed in tough love, corporal punishment and all that. We were not rich. Dad did what he thought was right. I ended up working in the civil service and my brother found success in sales/business. 
However, due to our upbringing, my brother hated (understatement) father. Dad would use traditional arguments, such as he brought us up, he spent money on us, yada yada to force brother to comply. 
Since brother was rich already, he wrote a cashiers order for a few million, passed it to my dad as ""repayment"" for all the years of resources, opportunity costs. He then doubled the amount of money to ""buy my freedom"" too. Brother then walked out of dad's life forever. 
Over the years, dad did not attend my brothers wedding, or meet his gf/wife. My dad doesn't know his own grandson. 
Dad died a few months back due to cancer. And in his deathbed. He confessed to me that driving brother away was his biggest, lifetime regret and he hopes to reconcile. Dad was hard on brother because he needed to teach him how to be a ""man"". He was extremely proud of my brother. My bro turned out to be the ideal son. Successful man that takes care of his own family.
That didn't happen. Brother didn't even attend his funeral.
After dad's death, we found out that he didn't touch the millions all these years. We wanted to return bro the money but bro objected, claiming that this money cannot be taken back. We decided do donate it to charity, brother also donated his entire share of my dad's estate to charity...
It's too late for our family. But I hope all asian, stern parents... just tell your kid that you love them.

40527,63802,"Dear all local university graduates, when you are searching for a job, please ask for a realistic pay.
Over the past week, I have interviewed some students who have ZERO working experience asking for pay of 7k and onwards. When asked for their reason for wanting that pay, their reason? ""I graduated from a local university with first class honor""
Word of advice to all
1. Please study the company properly before asking for sky high pay. Not all companies are Google, JP Morgan, Facebook that can give you sky high pay.
2. Continuing from point 1. find out who are you interviewing with and read up on his/her profile on LinkedIn etc. I have a handful of candidates whom are already informed that they are meeting the ""Regional Managing Director - APAC"" still tries to correct me on my company.
3. Don't get all defensive and offended when the interviewer ask you ""Why do you think you deserve this pay"" etc.
4. Grades is nothing to the eyes of more and more companies, we are looking for the right person with the right attitude. Few years back, I hired a student from NUS who was nearly expelled twice and took 6 years to complete his degree. Today he is one of my managers with a team of 20 under him.
With that, wishing all graduates good luck and all the best. Peace out

As I earn several times less than him, he is happy to pay for the lion's share of our wedding and future expenses. From his pov, he is a kids lover and he wants at least 2 kids. As for me, I am drawing up a list of demands:
- A condo, at least 3 rooms and above as our home
- A car for me to drive. At least 1.6L, brand doesn't matter and fully paid for by him
- A supplementary card for me with at least 3k per month credit. I must be able to spend the amount freely in the card every month, no qns asked
- At least 2 holidays every year. If due to the pandemic we can't go overseas, a gift of any amount of my choosing as a substitute.
- At least one maid for the household so that I don't have to cook, clean and wash
- A diamond ring costing at least 15k for the proposal
- No limit on the number of dogs, cats or any pets I keep in the house as I am an animal lover. All expenses paid by him
Any other things should I include?

51689,87282,"My bf of 3 years just proposed to me. He opened up the box containing the engagement ring to show me the ring inside, and I was about to say yes when I noticed that the ring didn’t look very atas.
I immediately questioned my bf on what brand that engagement ring was and he said that it was Chow Tai Fook. I felt that such an Asian brand was too low class for me and so I rejected his proposal on the spot.
If he really want to propose, I’d at least expect some ang mor brand like Cartier or Swarovski, which is much more high class than some random asian branded ring!
Seriously, this bf of mine deserve to stay single forever. Must be his mother never teach him properly from young, that’s why he don’t possess such common sense when it comes to such things. His father also isn’t any better, confirm is never buy proper rings for my bf’s mother when they were dating many years ago. Like that make until my bf’s mother don’t know how to teach my bf about what ring to buy for a girl.

38438,59956,"To #59879 - regarding amount to pay for marriage.
I'm a female and currently in marriage discussion with my partner as well. Allow me to share some background - i earn 2 times more than him. Unfortunately, it is due to our difference in educational background but he is not lacking in any way in terms of work ethics, characteristics and all compared to another male uni grad. He was a drop out and im a uni grad.
When we started our relationship, he already told me he had plans to marry me in the future. I saw how ""chose"" when to propose and when to have wedding banquet - its all about money. We basically started a jointed account togerher with a small sum every month, he calculated to be about 3 years. Because I earned a lot more, my personal savings and CPF is also a lot more than him as well.
Initially i agreed to ""hey, lets go with your plan, i wont interfere"" and i eventually realise that marriage and buying houses is not just what he wants, but is what i wanted too. So why should I put most of the burden (espcially financially) on him?
We had a long long talk once about it and came to a conclusion that we should get married when we both feel it's right, not when the money is right. It works in multiple ways - it could be less than 3 years, it could be more than 3 years. We also concluded that it's okay to use my savings for OUR things first (ie. Exclude engagement ring and proposal) if we want to get married. At the end of the day, we are going to be together forever, and those money can be earned back. Time cant wait. I also led a simple life where i dont need proposal to be as insane as those ""ideals"" shown in drama and social media. Im also happy with engagement ring that dont cost 4 digits. A proposal tells me he wants me to be his wife, doesnt matter how much is it. An engagement ring reminds me im his fiance, doesnt matter how much it cost. Because those are just 身外物 to our love.
After that night, when we feel so much more comfortable planning for our future financially, we realised a lot more - some things can be done first and some can be done later (ie. Pre wedding and actual wedding expenses).
The amazing thing is, even though he dont earn as much, he would still want to pay for our dates from time to time not because he thinks he has extra money, but he felt those are the little gestures of love and appreciation (we do on dutch other times or just take turns paying).
Yes, money is important, but marriage is about love and commitment and so money should never be the priority.
So yes, we are happily married, done banquet dinner and did almost everything a typical couple would go through when getting married but money has never been a topic for us to quarrel about. He is also not ashamed to tell his friends and family that I paid more even though i never once try to mention it.
So now, my personal savings? Is still growing despite me spending money for marriage and wedding banquet and now we are both saving up for our new house (fortunately so far mostly paid by CPF).
Really, girls, dont ever think that because your partner is a guy, thats why he must pay half or more as a social norm. A relationship is between two person to create a nurture and not defined by the ""definition"" from friends and social media.
PS: i use a lot a lot of social media and definitely envy other couple at times, but i get even happier knowing i have a life partner like my husband.

If you need a girlfriend to complete your life, then it is dependency, not love.

You and your girlfriend's life should be completed by itself, but you 2 still choose to be a couple to mutually enhance each other life.

Here is an anology:
In Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the Dino Megazord and Dragonzord are already fully functional by themselves, but they still combine to form the Mega Dragonzord

49712,83036,"My girlfriend and I met in the first year of uni. when I first lay my eyes on her, I knew she was the one. However, there was only one problem: she was attached. But I was going to overcome this hurdle nonetheless, afterall we were studying in an overseas uni and her boyfriend was in the army. I knew I could come in between their LDR - it was just a matter of time.
In addition, I knew i had a height advantage - I was 190cm and he was only 172cm. I feel like my looks are above average as well so I think that helped me in a way. On a normal day, I would ask when she was going to call her boyfriend so I could give her time and space. But in my heart I secretly wanted her all for myself.
I waited patiently, for my time to strike. It had been a few weeks now and I thought about how to disrupt their daily calls as they were still going strong. Thus, I had to purposely ask her to go for random courses and classes in the evening, as that was the only time she could call her boyfriend (due to the time difference between singapore and UK). Slowly but steadily, she started to reschedule or even cancel the calls with her boyfriend - to my pleasure.
She slowly grew attached to me, and told me some heartfelt thoughts like how she felt distant with her boyfriend. She asked me for advice of what to do and obviously I had to sow discord between them and even made her doubt their relationship.
In addition, I used a fake instagram account that I bought online to mask myself as some ex classmate of hers (let's call her Jane) and saying things like how her bf was cheating on her. Finally, the turning point in their relationship came. The LDR, constant fights and distrust became too hard to bear. They broke up and she naturally came falling into my arms.
I feel bad and actually guilty for doing such things thats why I'm writing this confession. My question to you guys is that if you were in my shoes, what would you do for love? what boundaries would you break and what morals would you shatter - to attain this entity we call love?
TLDR: Just because there is a goalkeeper, dosent mean you cannot score a goal. I hope this story inspires people out there whose crushes are attached, where I want you guys to know that nothing is impossible, just follow your dreams.

45616,73996,"TLDR: I broke up with my bf because he's a loner
We've been together for a year and I know him for 2 years. In the two years, he has gone out for dinner 3x with a JC friend, once with a pri sch friend, once with a cousin. That's it. I open his WA and I'm the only one who texts him regularly apart from his parents and siblings.
As a 25 year old guy, I expect you to have some people around you. Relatives, cousins, friends, someone! I'm an introvert too but I find him extreme. He works out by himself everyday, watches football, plays FIFA. I've asked him to at least watch football at a coffeeshop so you are around people, find some football fans online so you can talk to people. He can go weeks without anyone other than me and his fam talking to him. I couldn't stand it. I broke up.
How did he manage to get a gf then? He had so much time on his hands that he was always there for me, every impromptu lunch, every text at whatever time, he replied, he showed up.
Now, I'm moving on with my life but I'm worried for him. He refuses to change himself, he says he likes stability and is working on himself. But you won't grow just by being alone. You grow by talking, sharing, giving and being surrounded by people.
I asked him, ""Have you felt happy in the recent few years?""
He replied, ""No. I feel peaceful and that's enough for me.""
Loneliness is very difficult. I'm worried for him maybe because of guilt but idk what to do for him.

43053,68723,"Hi,
Long post ahead.
I just want to encourage all those who are struggling with your studies/work/finances/relationships/life in general to keep pushing on.
I am in my final year and my NUS journey is nothing but 7 consecutive semesters of struggle, occasionally interspersed with bouts of joy and relief. People around me are somehow always so intelligent and quick to grasp concepts - the same ideas I can take hours and days or even weeks to finally understand.
When people spend 3 hours to churn out an essay and get an A, I spend 3 days planning its outline and researching, and get only a B+. People tell me to study smart and not hard and I already know that (I have read many articles and books and watched videos on it) but I just don't know why. Over time, when people tell me to study smart and not hard, it sounds more sarcastic and hypocritical than constructive lol.
It doesn't help that I have to work part time and I don't have a domestic helper or automated cleaning machine to clean up the house. Some toxic friends/people I have met mocked me for ""having no life"" outside of family and school. Some commented that I am a ""country bumpkin"" because I don't travel or go for exchange. Some say I'm unfriendly because I don't hang out with them often at overpriced hipster cafes. They don't know that my parents are ageing and getting weaker. I don't want them to do too much housework or demand for them to pay for my school fees, overseas holiday, give me pocket money so I can go eat some avocado egg toast that looks better than it tastes.
But I'm not here to complain because I have learnt that complaining is extremely addictive, playing victim to uncontrollable circumstances feels particularly good, but it is also very unhelpful. Nothing is going to change for the better if I sit here and cry about how bad my life is.
Look, I know its hard and I know everyday feels like giving up when there's no visible end in sight. You don't know if things will eventually turn out well and you don't know whether your hard work will pay off.
But you have to remember that in this moment, despite all the uncertainty, your best option is to keep trying even if you fail repeatedly. There is no shame in trying your best. Of course it sucks not to see rewards when you keep trying so hard but at least you can be accountable to your conscience and be absolutely free of guilt when things really do not turn out your way.
Others who make you feel bad about your life problems should be ignored. I have cut off toxic people in my life and while I am left with only a few friends, they are more than enough. Sometimes it's lonelier to be with the wrong people.
You are not a let down when the outcomes don't reflect your hard work. It's just that things can and will never be the way we want to, no matter how many excel spreadsheets you create to plan some ideal vision of a future you strive for. It is this that is what makes life interesting.
Hang on and stay strong.

48781,80916,"**warning long post ahead**
I’m a pharmacist in a public hospital heavily affected by COVID-19. Today I would like to share with you some of the efforts of my pharmacy colleagues during this trying time. For those of you who have no idea what a pharmacist does, or those of you who think you do, please, read on.
First let’s begin with Community Pharmacies such as Guardian, Watsons and Unity. These are our front liners first hit by the Covid effect. They fended off hundreds who came on a daily basis to demand masks, sanitizers and soap that simply wasn’t available. They provided these products, without even sparing any for themselves. They had to deal with enquiries and panic from the public on a virus that wasn’t well researched at the time. They dealt with anger, and frustration, all the while still having to keep calm about their own fears. While the fight for masks seems to have settled, these pharmacists are now also affected by closures of some stores, dwindling product sales, and perhaps manpower cuts as well. To my friends in the community, thank you for being the first defenders, hang in there.
From the start of the new year, pharmacists were in meetings planning and predicting the onslaught of this virus and what we can do to effectively tide through. When NCID started opening its doors to screen, an urgent call for volunteer pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians was made, to open a new pharmacy to serve potential COVID patients at the screening centre over the Chinese New Year period. Many colleagues willingly volunteered their services, even though they were only given a day’s notice because of the urgency of the developing situation. These pharmacists continue to serve, and are usually the last step before patients are inadvertently are either sent home, or sent up to the wards. They don PPE for hours, work overnight, and eat luke warm meals, for your sake. (STAY HOME!!)
The situation is constantly evolving, and so are the languages. In the COVID wards, pharmacists had to quickly become familiar with all kinds of terms in all sorts of languages. In the beginning, with many chinese patients being admitted, they became adept in the Chinese language - if differentiating Ceftazidime and Cefuroxime is a struggle for you, imagine doing that in chinese!! FYI we need to talk to patients and find out things like their past medications or allergies, cos if you’re allergic to a medication and if our medical teams give it to you without knowing, you could possibly die from that sooner than COVID-19 could ever kill you. Also, if you’ve ever spoken to your parents or grandparents about their medications, you’d know they probably describe them as like the small white round pill, the yellow long capsule without knowing what it’s for. Now try doing that with a foreigner, who has no idea what his meds are for. In a language you don’t understand LOL (most!! intense!! guessing!! game!! ever!!) Guess wrong, and your patient could have a seizure, start having palpitations, break out into rashes, or... die. Kudos to our pharmacists who do this on a daily basis in their wards with 40+ patients, not just during covid, but EVERY DAY. Thank you!!
Just today, Singapore has had our highest spike in Covid-19 cases, and that means emergency measures to MAKE SPACE in the wards. The concept of decantment started early on from weeks ago, where patients who were relatively more stable would be “decanted” to off site facilities such as community hospitals. This protects the patients as well so that we can reduce their potential risk of exposure to the virus. By closing off some wards, this means patients are admitted, and often “discharged” from their original wards much faster than before. Pharmacists battle with the rapid transfers as each patient’s medications needs to be reviewed for accuracy, safety and efficacy prior to transfer, and of course provided with a new bag of medications to bring with them to the new hospital. To put this in perspective, it’s like trying your best to get to know a person you just met RAPIDLY, so that you can give them a great gift basket of all the things they need, accurately, a few days or hours later. To those fighting to decant our patients safely, thank you!!
As more and more data about covid-19 comes up, im sure you’ve heard about people dying from Chloroquine etc. Pharmacists are the drug experts, and we are proud of that. Expert pharmacists are scouring medical journals for evidence on new treatment options, possible vaccinations being developed. They summarise the information for our medical teams in the hospitals to be able to make appropriate decisions at the point of patient care. Pharmacists in the wards are involved in the monitoring of these patients put on experimental drugs. We review the safety and efficacy of such medications, as well as deciding doses based on important monitoring parameters such as patient renal function, liver function, past medical history and current condition. You may have seen news on medications you may need to avoid e.g. Ibuprofen from unverified sources, well pharmacists have had a role in helping debunk that too! We study the mechanisms behind interactions, we rationalise if such things are possible, we justify them if they are, and we do this every day!! Yay Pharmacists!
Behind the scenes, as more countries close their borders, our store and procurement pharmacists fight battles on a daily basis to ensure we have enough medications to tide through however long this crisis may last. While you are worried about whether you can bake your cake tonight with all the flour gone from the shelves, our pharmacists worry that in time, a patient in a pain crisis will not get their opioids because we don’t have any to spare. We are worried patients will have a heart attack or stroke because our hospitals have run out of blood thinners. Pharmacists are looking at data on how we can prolong the use of each vial of medication so that we can conserve for the future, but all these have their limits. And this is why, we need help from you at home to be understanding that we cannot give you 6 months of medications now. We can only give you what you need, because we NEED TO ENSURE THERE IS ENOUGH for other patients (seems like a recurrent theme from our supermarkets and government etcetc. Please lah, tolong don’t hoard... ). Also, FYI we don’t offer exchange or refund. Please: the argument is always the same, that you kept it well in a pristine condition. Well... what if you were the one who recieved the refunded meds, are you ok knowing that it sat for 2 months in someone else’s home??? If you’re not ok, then are pharmacists or the healthcare sector supposed to absorb the cost of the returned meds when you were the one who insisted you wanted a year’s supply? To all of you pharmacists, technicians and friends who have had a patient scream at you because they cannot get what they want, when they want it, stay strong, thank you.
Your grandparents, or parents may have had their appointments rescheduled, so what about their medications? Home delivery services have been extended to all patients, you don’t even have to contact us first, we trace the patients that need a top up, and call YOU instead. This has increased the workload significantly!! With healthcare, it’s not like your Taobao delivery. They deliver wrong, at some inconvenience, you can usually get a return, refund. If pharmacies deliver the wrong meds to the wrong patient, that’s a nightmare. What if the other patient missed their meds because of that? Or what if our elderly frail giddy patient who is illiterate takes the medication meant for a 25 year old with terrible hypertension, causing his blood pressure to drop? So much could go wrong. In some hospitals, even patients discharged will have their medications delivered to them to reduce unnecessary contact. Let me just tell you - explaining medications to a patient in person can be very difficult. Explaining medications to a patient who is xxx km away from you who does not know what you are talking about is nearly impossible. This has increased the time we take to do things significantly!!! But pharmacists remain patient, remain calm, and keep going. Because that is the professionalism we continue to show as a healthcare professional. Thank you!
I know many of us in the pharmacy profession often feel forgotten, but seeing how dynamic our profession is during times of crisis, I hope this is a good reminder of why we serve. There are so many roles of the pharmacist which I have not been able to share, because I am not the best person to, but to our researchers, regulatory pharmacists, IT pharmacists, and so many more, thank you. For all of us (even other healthcare professionals too!) who feel you are not directly at Screening Centre, NCID, TTSH, etc - no matter what, be proud to call yourself a COVID-19 Frontliner, because you are. Each and every one of us is necessary to keep this healthcare system going. Stay positive, Stay motivated, we are in this for the long run.
