50703,85226,"Sorry I just need to rant.. Recently my boyfriend bought me a Louis Vuitton wallet which costs around $700 for my birthday. When I saw the wallet, I felt really upset and disappointed. Because earlier this year, my sister's bf got her a Chanel wallet which costs at least $1000 for her birthday. Chanel is so much nicer than LV. Let's be honest, LV is for poor people who want to look rich. And during this CB, her bf always order food from more popular restaurants like Crystal Jade and Paradise Dynasty for her. But my bf only orders food from cheap restaurants like Swensen's and Ichiban for me. Her bf even gives her $1000 a month for her own spending. But my bf only gives me $500 a month. I hate to admit but I really feel very jealous of my sister because her bf is willing to spend money on her despite earning just $4k a month. My bf earns at least $5k and yet he is so stingy with me. Sometimes I really feel like a loser.. why my sister can find such a good bf but I just cannot. Just because she is taller and slimmer, she can find a good bf.. it's so unfair. Sorry for the long rant.

Guy A is a close male friend of mine in uni while Guy B is my current BF.
I used to think that my relationship is very stable before entering uni, however Guy A appeared in my life and made me reconsidered my original thoughts. Lately, I found out that I really love to engage in intelligent conversation with A, talking about all kinds of life issues and travelling experiences etc. On the other hand, my BF will only talk to me about boring and meaningless army stuffs that spark zero interest in me. He simply couldn't understand that I already had enough academic troubles on my plate. Worse of all, he cannot be there when I had emotional break downs . I'm glad Guy B was there to hug me to sleep when I needed emotional support the most. Although I'm a fan of swensen's and ajisen, that doesn't mean that I won't get sick of it. When I suggest to visit atas places for our anniversaries, my BF would always brush this topic aside by saying that we should save up for BTO, money is hard to earn blah blah blah...(Excuses). Sometimes I would rather stay at home then go out with him, there was once I cancelled a date on him and went to wave house with A. Compared to my BF, A is able to surprise me on every single outing.
Truth to be told, A did hinted to me that he had feelings for me but I don't want to promise him anything yet. As of now, I haven't cheated on my BF yet, I giving him one more year to change for the better.

51354,86471,"Admins please don't filter this. My best friend's gf broke our friendship. I'm so upset. They've been together for 5 years, so what? I've known my best friend since last year, but I've always believed in 'bros before hoes' (ok I'm a girl but I believe in this case bros means friends).
Actually, the first time I saw my bestie, I fell in love with him. He's handsome and kind to everyone, so I tried getting closer to him in hopes that we can get together. But then after awhile I realised he had a gf so I thought ok, I just have to show him that I'm better than her then he will come to my side. I'm prettier than her, and we are both in nus while she's in some unknown uni. Thankfully he treated me as a close friend so he shared a lot about his gf to me and even the details of their dates, so I knew how to compete.
Then at the start of this year, HE TOLD ME HER BIRTHDAY IS ON THE SAME DAY AS ME SO HE CANT SPEND TIME WITH ME ON THAT DAY! They were gonna go to the zoo for the entire day. (This was before CB) i tried asking if I could tag along but he said no. Come on la. Gf only what, his best friend has the same bday as her doesn't mean he can neglect the best friend right. So I stopped texting him and gave him the cold shoulder. It worked and he told me ""let's have dinner together on your birthday instead?"". Ofc I said yes. He suggested amk hub food court. What the? But ok la, I said I wanted teppanyaki and he said sure. Finally I can feel like his gf for once.
The day came, and I realised his 'together' meant him, me and HIS GF. They got me a gift and said they shared price for it. Can't the gf find a gift to give me on her own? So low effort, share price. At the teppanyaki place I tried sitting between him and her but she moved to his other side. Cannot be apart for just awhile? I told him he should pay for dinner since it's our bday and he should treat us, but the gf offered to pay half of the total. A little sick of her efforts to please him at this point.
Then after dinner I asked if he wanted to walk me home, he said no because he and gf actually booked movie tickets and it was starting soon. So I asked him to buy me another ticket so I can join in but the gf interrupted and told me no very rudely. When she went toilet, he apologised to me and said they booked the couple seats last week so it's a little impossible to join. Who ask them book couple seats? They had one week to ask me and they didn't. I just left immediately. He tried to call me that night but I blocked him on every online platform.
After two days I unblocked him and sent him a long text about how his gf is too needy and he needs to spend more time with me, but the message was left on single tick. The next day I bumped into him in school and tried to say hi but he just walked off. Until now he isn't talking to me. 6 months already. I sent him a lot of texts but it's all one tick. I even tried texting his gf but same thing. I went to his house a few times but saw the gf shoes there so I left.
Is he overreacting? Am I overreacting? Is this friendship even worth it anymore?

42009,66398,"Just ORD from the army last week with a LTA rank. I will be matriculating into NUS in Aug. I want to ask, how much does your former rank play in nus? Like for e.g. if you apply for some things they may ask of your past experiences. If I say that I was an officer in the army, how much of a benefit would I get over my peers?
Also, how is the culture like among peers in daily life depending on your former rank, for guys? For example if you were a men would you get looked down versus if you were an officer would your male friends show more respect to you? For e.g. if I were to apply for a CCA club president role, would people be more likely to vote for me if I say that I have more leadership experience in the army?
If the answer to all the above is “no”, can some fellow former officers who are already students advise what kind of other benefits can we expect to get in the university, including intangible ones, for those of us who were formerly officers?

59713,105286,"Hi all, just wanted to let something off my chest. So… I have 4 siblings which are all brothers.( I am a guy btw) The 5 of us are very close since young and we always share things like usage of car, clothes etc.
We are all working adults now and 4 of my brothers can’t find their right one (they are middle age men now). I felt bad for them and asked my wife if she is willing to have sex with my brothers and have a child with each of them to boost their self esteem.
In which, she agreed. (With conditions like 100k for each child birth ) She then had sex with my oldest brother about 5 years ago. Which I have regretted this decision and really defeated every inch of my soul. I cried very badly outside their room that night. Since then she had sex with my 3 other brothers occasionally. I act like I am okay in front of them. But in fact it was killing me inside, each time they had sex.
Today, we each have one child. When I look at my brother’s child, I felt sadness and emptiness in my heart. I start to question myself “what if this child does better than my child”, “what if my wife likes this child better than our child, which cause an impact on our relationship”.
I start to think a lot since the start of the sex with my brothers, which really impacted my mental health a lot as I did not mention to them about my feelings as I do not wish to ruin our relationship, both brother and wife.
I started to have depression and have sucidal thoughts after one month my wife had sex with my oldest brother. Even though this is transactional, but I still felt really bad and felt that my self worth is worse than a bag full of dirt.
Today, when we go out as a family, me, my 4brothers, wife and 5 childrens. I felt very insecure and wish to die everyday. I do not know what is the point in living already. Btw the children all acknowledge me as the dad. As registered in the all their birth cert.
All in all, I do not know why I suggest such a stupid idea. And I really f regret it to the core of my soul.
Please advise how to cope with this… I don’t think I can tahan already

He's playing this game which I did not catch the title of, but I can hear words like ""first blood"", ""an ally has been slained"", ""enemy has slained Lord"" and ""your team has destroyed an enemy"". From the sound of it, it sounds like a very violent game. I am very concerned that my bf is playing games that involves killing people. More importantly, when I look at the character my bf is using, it's always a girl character that looks like a child. Is it an early sign of pedophilia?

51275,86352,"I'm starting to lose interest in this girl I met from Tinder after realising she only has 1k IG followers. So I am still confused as to whether I should even give her a chance.
So what happened was I matched with this girl on Tinder. She is my type, pretty, nice body, educated, decent job, outgoing personality. So we hit it off quite well and our convo moved from Tinder to texting. We would text daily, and sometimes even video call at night. I really enjoyed our convos and felt we had great chemistry.
After about 2 weeks, I decided to ask her for her IG. To my surprise, she only has 1,000+ IG followers! And she is following 800+ people. Means majority of her followers are just her friends. She barely has any fans and her IG is public some more.
Now, I am someone who has always pride myself on only dating influencers. I myself have around 10k followers. I've had 4 ex-girlfriends before, their IG following ranged from 10k to 80k.
Like it or not, your IG followers is a reflection of how attractive you are. Cos if you are hot, confirm will attract followers on IG. I myself am quite a catch, which is why I managed to get 10k followers even though I don't post very often also. So since I am considered the cream of the crop, I will also only want to date girls who are the cream of the crop. My friends have also always admired me for being able to date all these highly coveted girls.
So I must admit this new Tinder girl became less attractive in my eyes when I found out she only has 1k followers. I started to become a bit distant but the more cold I become, the more hot she become which makes me feel guilty like maybe I should give her a chance? Plus, my previous relationships all failed because when you are dating IG famous girls, you need to deal with a different set of issues like jealousy, insecurity, cheating etc.
But at the same time, I can totally picture my friends judging me for lowering my standards by dating such an average girl. I mean you go to pre-covid Orchard Road anyhow throw stone will probably hit some girl with only 1k followers. Plus I get invited to Media/PR events quite often. Can you imagine how embarrassing it will be if I bring this girl there with her 1k followers? I will also feel so embarrassed to tag her in my IG if we really end up together. Like my followers will prob go see her IG and realise I have really downgraded from 80k to 1k.
This tinder girl wants to meet after Phase 1 is lifted. Should I give her a chance knowing that I am definitely the more attractive one? Any advice from people who dated someone who is in a lower league and didn't regret it?
P.S: Please don't be hypocrites and troll this post. I'm sure all of you follow hot people on IG who have no idea you exist. My salary is quite average but I can assure you I get more girls sliding into my DMs than high earning investment bankers.
P.P.S: Please don't give me bs about inner beauty vs outer beauty. They are not mutually exclusive. Apart from my 3rd ex, my other 3 exes were super kind and nice girls.

58767,103458,"I have been dating my bf for a while but there are some points that I just cannot shrug off.
The expectation is that a guy should be at least a head taller than his girlfriend, but this is something that can only happen in my dream. The reason is he is only 2cm taller and not even 175cm, meaning that it feels like he is a sister/pal to me rather than an oppa. He is way too short for a guy and it doesnt give me a strong sense of security. I estimate he is in the lower tier of height range perhaps somewhere between 1.70-1.73m.
In fact, I would like to ask my fella ladies out there who are willing to date shorter guys or even marry them. What do you see in them? Dont you regret it after a while or will make this an issue whenever you start quarreling? There are plenty of bigger fishes out there and I am now starting to regret it.
Before you commentors start bashing me, I will be fair and point out some of his merits along with my concerns.
1. Yes, he is pretty good looking and has a nice heart. He often shows care for cats/dogs and feed them but I find this trait less manly and somewhat gross. A real man should be more aggressive, not like a beta sissy that plays with small animals.
2. He often buys lunch for me and brings it to the secondary school where I am teaching. However, sometimes kaypoh students will come to me and ask ""Cher, your boyfriend ah? Legit? Why so short one?""- Not surprising since even my female students are taller than him. This is ridiculously embarassing. I even told my bf not to bring lunch to me but he doesnt get my point... He will just say "" If we are truly in love, we shouldnt care what others say""..... Yeah right you are not the teacher...
3. He will offer to carry the plastic bags whenever we go shopping. The problem is his legs are short so his hands are like in close proximity to the ground, resulting in some long plastic bags being dragged, even though I understand he doesnt mean it. This is pretty unsightly.
4. He is a mathematician and I remembered once he drew me a heart using math equations. This seems romantic to others but lame in my eyes. If he is sincere, he would have drawn the heart by hand, not indulge in these kinds of boring stuff. After all, how can all these math help him in his future prospect? I knew of a few friends already earning big bucks without knowledge of maths.
I do not not wish to elaborate any further because for every merit that I can think of, it is diluted by the negative aspects. They cant even offset his midget stature.
Unfortunately, all the good quality tall guys are already taken by the short girls, otherwise I would have ended this relationship earlier. I do not want my female besties to find out that I broke up, so I will just bear with it for a while.
My message to my fella sisters out there who are currently attached to the shorter guys. It is never too late to back out! Think of your future!

52430,88911,"My bf and I have a joint savings account. I'm a student while he's been working for two years so he's the only one contributing to the account.
A few months ago, a good friend of mine wanted to buy something expensive so she borrowed $700 from me. My personal savings account has very little money so I used money from the joint account to lend my friend.
My friend told me that she will return me the money by last month but she hasn't done so. I'm not surprised because she has a habit of forgetting to return money e.g. whenever we go out to eat, I would pay for the meal first but she would often forget to return me her portion of the bill. Although she is a mutual friend of me and my bf, my bf dislikes her because of this.
Today, my bf asked me if my friend has returned me the $700. When I told him that she hasn't returned, he asked me to remind her to return the money. I told him that it would be embarrassing to ask her to return the money. Thus, he said he can help me to ask her to return the money.
$700 is not a big amount so I don't understand why he is so determined to get the money back. Granted, that $700 comes from the joint account, which consist of his money. But since it is a joint account, the money inside also belongs to me. That gives me the right to do whatever I want with the joint account. If my friend really forget to return the money then so be it. I would just take it as I bought a $700 gift for my friend. No big deal.
I really hate that my bf is so calculating. Why would he even want to ask her to return the $700? It's not even a lot of money. I really hate guys who are calculating. Should I just dump him?

58649,103251,"I've been together with my boyfriend for 3 years. Last year he graduated and found a job that pays him $3.5k a month. To be honest I was shocked that his salary is quite low. Because some of my friends and cousins are earning much higher than him. I often encouraged him to find a better job. I also asked him to take up some courses to improve his chances. He already took up a few courses but he still couldn't find a better job.
Recently, I was bored and downloaded a dating app for fun. Surprisingly, I matched with a lot of guys who seem quite eligible. I even matched with a lawyer and an investment associate. I have been chatting with the investment associate for two weeks now. He would text me only a few times a day because he's a very busy guy. Yesterday was his birthday so he told me he celebrated his birthday with his family at home.
After his birthday celebration, he suddenly said he wants to see me. At around 3am, he snuck out of his house and drove to my house to see me. I went down to the carpark to meet him and was quite surprised to see that he drives a luxury car and he looks even better in real life. We chatted for 2 hours in his car. He then walked me to the lift and even kissed me on my cheek. Although we barely know each other, I actually feel quite happy that he kissed me. When he reached home, he texted me to say that he enjoyed talking to me and he would like to see me again.
He seems like a really nice guy. I know I shouldn't compare but my bf isn't even that nice. And my bf is unable to find a decent job so I'm worried about my future when we get married. But my bf and I have been together for 3 years so our relationship is very stable. I feel like if I break up with him now, 3 years of my life would be wasted. What should I do? Should I just stick to my bf because he is obviously a safer choice? Or should I continue to go out with the investment guy and then break up with my bf when the investment guy confess to me?

Whenever I request to eat something that is apparently not very comfortable to his wallet (not sure what that means), he will always insist we eat at a nearby foodcourt or hawker?
Firstly, places like that are usually very dirty and hot like why would I even consider dining there? The food's good but he brought me out for a date so I shouldn't even be expecting him to request us to eat there? Like it's a date and I barely get to see him because he only books out on the weekend.
Secondly, I prefer food that looks pretty so I can take Instagram worthy pictures of it and have my bragging rights?
Lastly, I don't want to be seen dressed up in a very cute dress while at a hawker? That doesn't look pretty to me anymore.
Even when eating out at a mall, I was obviously craving for pasta and of course I wanted Hoshino, but he could only offer to dine in at Saizeriya because it was cheaper for him. Wtf? I will never step foot into that restaurant knowing that is where all the poor people go to when they want to eat pasta and try to pretend they are atas, BECAUSE WESTERN IS EXPENSIVE. Eventually we did ended up in Hoshino, but he didn't order his food because mine was already $13 which is double of what is offered at Saizeriya in terms of price. Whatever, at least I got to eat what I wanted :). He then went home and cook Maggie for himself? How broke can anyone be? Don't get a girlfriend if you can't afford it, especially when you're in NS.
I need some advice and or suggestions to open up my bf's wallet like stop being stingy...

44460,71670,"Today, I felt my heart properly break for the first time. The course I’m studying has quite a heavy workload so I haven’t been going home for the past three weeks. My father came to visit me today. He is rarely ever free and today is one of those days that he could make time.
My father is close to 70 years old and he is still not retired. He works as a cleaner at a country club during the day and holds another cleaning job at the community centre near my house at night. For some reason, he had half a day off today and he said he wanted to tour my hall. He came over and after showing him my room, we decided to get dinner at the Kopitiam at Kent Ridge MRT.
I know my father doesn’t have money so I offered to pay for his dinner. Guess what? The silly man ordered the cheapest thing he could find - fishball noodles. There was a lady (very well dressed, looks to be at least middle-class) infront of us in the queue and she left her chilli on the counter then walked away somewhere. My father didn’t see it and thought that that was an extra sauce so he just took it and put in on our tray. When the lady returned, she said very sarcastically that someone took her chilli while glancing up and down at my father. He immediately apologised and explained to her that we were not aware and that she could have her chilli back but she replied “你动过的我才不要。肮脏死”, which loosely translates into “I don’t want what you’ve touched. You’re dirty to death”.
This was when I realised that my father was still in his uniform. I almost screamed at this lady seeing as she was clearly younger than my father and was being rude. However, my father held me back and simply apologised again. He said that he’s used to it and it suddenly hit me that this is what he does all on a day to day basis. He apologises and lets people walk over him. He is invisible. I always knew my dad worked hard and is always at the mercy of others but seeing it with my own two eyes was an entirely different experience. I couldn’t even hold back my emotions and start tearing uncontrollably while we were eating. I had to lie that I was tearing because I got chilli in my eye but the truth is I was heartbroken by how my dad has to swallow his pride all the time.
I can’t wait for the day when I can tell him to stop working and stop apologising for everything. All my dad ever did was love and dote on me but everyone else has just been so awful to him. Dear rich people, what did we ever do wrong to you?

I have been dating my fiance for 3 years and we have been working for 2 years since graduating. He proposed to me last december and since then, I have been asking him to plan for our wedding, which I would prefer to be held as soon as possible because I am tired of working and want to be a housewife.
He told me he would prefer to have the wedding next year because he needs some time to plan the wedding but I want it to be held preferably by end of this year. Since he has agreed to stay at my parents’ house after marriage then there shouldn’t be any issues at all.
I just cannot understand why he wants to wait until next year to have the wedding because actually I was asking for a very simple wedding. I only wanted to invite our friends and relatives to a dinner at a mid-tier hotel like Pan Pacific and to get very affordable wedding bands like Cartier. He certainly can afford them because he has $30k in his personal savings account and he earns $5k a month.
I’m not even asking for much because I know there are way more expensive places to hold a banquet and way more high-end jewellery brands to get wedding bands from. But he thinks that the wedding bands and hotels I chose are too extravagant even though I have offered to help him pay 20% of all expenses. Because of all these issues, we quarrelled a lot and eventually I decided to break up with him because I realise he’s a very selfish person who doesn’t even care about what I want at all. Even the engagement ring he got for me was a small 0.9 carat which cost only $9k although I have specifically told him that I wanted a 1.5 carat.
Now that we have broken up, we are in the midst of discussing how to split our joint account money and he said he will give me half of the money inside, which is only $10k. His excuse for giving me only half of the money is that he was the only one contributing to the joint account. He did contributed to 100% of the joint account but I was the one who encouraged him to save up. Whenever he wanted to buy useless things like Nintendo Switch, I stopped him from buying them. Without me, he wouldn’t even have savings at all. Moreover, I wasted 3 years of my life on him so I think I deserve more than $10k. Honestly, even if he gives me all the money, which is merely $20k, I still don’t think it’s enough to compensate for the 3 years. But he seems reluctant to give me 100% of the money and kept giving me all sorts of lame excuses. Should I continue to ask for $20k or should I just settle for $10k? I’m so tired of fighting over this.

51689,87282,"My bf of 3 years just proposed to me. He opened up the box containing the engagement ring to show me the ring inside, and I was about to say yes when I noticed that the ring didn’t look very atas.
I immediately questioned my bf on what brand that engagement ring was and he said that it was Chow Tai Fook. I felt that such an Asian brand was too low class for me and so I rejected his proposal on the spot.
If he really want to propose, I’d at least expect some ang mor brand like Cartier or Swarovski, which is much more high class than some random asian branded ring!
Seriously, this bf of mine deserve to stay single forever. Must be his mother never teach him properly from young, that’s why he don’t possess such common sense when it comes to such things. His father also isn’t any better, confirm is never buy proper rings for my bf’s mother when they were dating many years ago. Like that make until my bf’s mother don’t know how to teach my bf about what ring to buy for a girl.

41748,65932,"Hi everyone, I’m currently serving NS but I’ve been accepted to NUS so i hope it’s okay if i post my experience on toxic masculinity here. (Don’t worry it’s not an army-bashing post)
My parents, like most love me very much. They would always check up on my studies, ask if i need money when going out and gave their 110% to support me when enlisting (i.e calling me at night, picking me up from Pasir Ris, buying me snacks for the week). However, they had a shortcoming which only manifested itself after i POP-ed - Elitism.
I didn’t perform very well for my BMT which meant that i got a posting in a non-combat vocation, specifically a logistics quartermaster. So incase you weren’t aware, there are the 4 perceived “Hero” vocations that are seen as the most elite in the eyes of my parents - Guards, CDO, OCS(Not rly a vocation but status symbol nonetheless , NDU). When my parents were always going on about how I have to go to a “Hero” vocation and were absolutely crestfallen when they had heard about my posting. Connections were called and requests were written to various places (All behind my back).
And when those efforts proved fruitless, it was when i realised how toxic they could be when it came to my masculinity. I was berated for being in a 姑娘 vocation which was meant for “useless” people. They encouraged me to lie during family gatherings to avoid embarrassment. I had stopped receiving emotional support from them (Calls, rides, a simple “how was your day”). On days were i had offs or half days, i would be greeted with a “why are you home so early” rather than a welcome home. They would compare me with my cousins and ask why I was not able to live up to the standards of the family.
One time they said that i would not get any inheritance from them because a “姑娘” does not need money as she is not the breadwinner of the family. That last one really hit close to home as i have never, nor will i ever ask and pry about money let alone family inheritance so for them to think that I was eyeing their money was really heartbreaking to me.
They recently informed me that they won’t be attending my specialist graduation parade which was really what drove me to craft this post. Mum, Dad I love you both and should the time come, I would die for you. Is that not enough to constitute what a “man” should be.
Anyway I’m not here to ask for advice, I’m dealing with it on my own. I just wanted to let future parents know what I’m going through and should you have a son in the near future, I hope you guys won’t adopt the same mindset as my parents. It really hurts.

51954,87854,"My bf just received his bonus for his first job and he asked me if I want him to buy anything for me. Since we have plans to get married next year, I asked him to buy me a 2-carat diamond ring from tiffany, which would cost around $50k. To my horror, he said I am being too demanding. He even suggested we get an engagement ring from a local jewellery store instead. How can he say that? It's every girl's dream to have a nice engagement ring what. Somemore his bonus is like $24k. He just needs to top up a little bit more to buy the ring. For the past two years, other than paying for meals and overseas trips and occasionally giving me handmade gifts, he has never gifted me anything significant. Can't he just be generous for once? For goodness' sake, I only have this one small request and he is not even willing to fulfil it. Gosh I'm so disappointed in him I can't even imagine having a future with him anymore. What should I do? Should I persuade him to buy the ring or just break up with him since he is so stingy?

51800,87533,"Hi, I’m the OP of #85226, the one who ranted about the Chanel vs LV wallet a few weeks ago. First of all, I want to thank all of you for the advice you’ve given. I’ve tried to do my best not to compare my bf with my sister’s bf since then. But what happened today really made me cannot take it.
Since today is the first day of phase 2, my sister and I both met our boyfriends today for the first time in months. When I see the way my sister’s bf treat my sister vs how my bf treats me, I really cannot take it.
This morning, my sister’s bf turned up in a Mercedes Benz car to pick my sister up for their date. Meanwhile, my bf picked me up at the MRT station and we both took the MRT to our destination. To put it bluntly, public transport is for poor people, and I’m still trying to wash the stench of the MRT off myself as I type this thing.
Next, I went shopping with my bf. We went to the outdoor shops at Chinatown, as suggested by my bf, as he felt that outdoor shops are a safer option than indoor malls which may be crowded, given COVID-19. Fair enough, I thought. But later on I really felt like slapping someone when I heard where my sister went shopping with her bf. Her bf brought her to Changi Jewel, and they went shopping at luxury shops, among them ... more of the same old Chanel!!! What a disgrace my bf is! Let’s be real, Chinatown is for old people like your ah ma and ah pehs, not for young people like us!
Lastly, I went for dinner with my bf. We managed to make a reservation at Haidilao, and we had hotpot which cost us $50 each. Meanwhile, as I heard from my sis later on, she and her bf went to a three star Michelin French restaurant where it cost them $500 per person to have their romantic candlelight dinner. I really have to say, Haidilao like LV wallets, are for poor people who want to look rich. Those who are really rich all go to Michelin restaurants liao!
Sorry for the really long rant this time round, really needed to let it out... I’ll try to take all of your advice and do my best not compare our bfs anymore from now on.

While I appreciate the efficiency of transferring the $$, I was upset that he did not transfer $21 instead? To put things in context, I was brought up being taught that if my friend paid for smth which costs let's say $2.70, out of courtesy for his/her service, return $3. Basically my parents said to round up instead of being calculative to the CENTS.
It's not that I want to EARN his 3cents. We are both working adults in our late 20s with more than enough savings. However I never thought that he was the nitty gritty type. We have only been dating for a few months, so I probably haven't seen all sides of him?
But wow exactly $20.97... really??? Tell me if one of you humans out there are like me who would also transfer $21 instead? Or am I an anomaly.

57933,101855,"Need to rant. My ex-boyfriend is so cheapskate. Today he suddenly texted me and asked me if I could return him the engagement ring that he proposed to me with.
We dated for 4 years before he proposed to me in August last year. A month later, he quit his job because he wanted to start a business with his friends. I then broke up with him as I felt very disappointed with his stupid start-up dreams. Fortunately I met someone new at my workplace who’s way more mature and financially stable than him so I managed to quickly move on.
So today he told me he would like to sell the engagement ring as he would like to expand his business. I asked him why bother selling this ring as it’s not that expensive anyway. He then said that this ring costs alot to him as he saved up for 2 years to buy it because he knew that it was my dream to own this ring. Playing the sympathy card. Yikes.
To be honest this ring is not really super expensive, at most $60k? So I don’t understand why he is so determined to take it back. I am seriously disgusted with how thick-skinned he is, how he tries so hard to convince me to return him the ring. Somemore he already know that it is my dream to own this ring.
But when I told my friends about this, they all told me I should return him the ring and support him in his start-up dream and then ask my current boyfriend to buy me a new one. Seriously how to support such stupid dream? So should I return him the ring or not? I have the right to reject him right?

59822,105532,"When you cause me so much anger and pain and not see what you have done to me.
She was my gf for almost a year. Out of the few girls that I've dated, she was the hottest one. I admit I am a very confident man. I workout and lift weights and I am tall at 1.85cm while she's 1.65cm. I always believe we look very good together and I am the envy of many men for having her as my gf. People always look our way when we walk past and I was sure it's because we are a very good looking couple.
We always argued. I was often angry. She cannot see how much frustration she has brought me. She cannot see when its clearly her fault when things happen. I don't believe no other guys are chasing her when we are together and I admit I let my anger get the better of me sometimes. She has many unknown calls and she would always deny it when I ask if it's from other guys. If you have unknown calls why won't you delete it if it's really from a stranger? Why keep the number on the log? A few times she threw her phone because she was so angry by what I've found on her phone and social media. If you have nothing to hide, why get mad? I deleted all her phone numbers as I was sure she was saving numbers under girls names when its actually guys numbers.
I kept saying she will cheat on me one day and she really left me one day. Then she got together with another guy barely 2 months after we broke up. I was still in the process of trying to get her back as we always patch back but it stopped working. So many times I caught him sending her home and it made me so mad. I made sure she remembers I will forever be single thanks to a cheater like her. Towards the end it was really ugly and I wanted to get back at her. I didn't want to give her the satisfaction so I destroyed everything of hers that she left at my home. I never forgot the way she insulted me. I did hope she is never happy forever for how she ended our relationship. I made sure she heard even my mum cursed her for causing me so much unhappiness.
That guy she dated was so short. I don't know what she sees in him. I always believed she got together with him to spite me. I was sure he can't satisfy her better than me. He don't even have half my stature or presence. He doesn't even drive a car like me. I find it unbelieveable that after me, she actually married that short guy and had a child with him.
I cannot get over the fact after leaving me, she married the first guy who wanted her. I know how to enjoy life while she chose to suffer with that poor short chap? When I meet or bump into mutual friends who also knows her, I feel my anger and bitterness coming back each time. I purposely flirted with her besties once when I bumped into them. I wanted them to tell her how happy and happening I am without her. And I have no lack of women surrounding me.
A part of me deeply wishes she suffer whenever I am reminded of her. I even purposely move around her workplace hoping she will bump into me and I hope she regrets letting me go as I am successful and earn more than her dwarf husband now.
I hope you remember me forever because you've been such a horrible person to me.

I got to know this girl through playing mobile legends. At that time, i was sourcing for a squad or active players to play rank games together through facebook pages. She's an extrovert, in contrast to me, an introvert so i enjoyed her company alot. She's also very cheerful and very well liked by people around her.
We would meet up often under void decks or malls to play ML together. There were also late nights whereby we will discord and play till early morning. I started to develop feelings for her and I felt like we were already an item. She would report to me where she was going and call me when i am not online on Mobile Legends.
This continued for more than half a year when i finally felt i had the courage to express myself to her. I purposely MIA for the whole day so that she would call me. And, at around 1am, i finally got the call i was waiting for. I picked it up and told her how much i liked her and i wouldn't want to see her with any other guys.
Unlike any other love stories, she just said, i was nothing more than a ML friend that brought her to mythic. And that was how my world fell apart again.

So I have been supporting both of us with my pay alone, which is not much, and I don’t get to save even though I have been working for years. We are living paycheck to paycheck, which was okay for me last time but now that we are talking about long-term, I’m not sure if I can live like this forever.
I get stressed about our BTO thinking about the money I need to fork out, but she will just tell me to find another job that has higher pay and she even told me to borrow from my family. Her family doesn’t want to lend us the money for our house, because my girlfriend has never contributed to the family business. She has been pressuring me to get money from my family whenever I bring up about financial issues, but my family is just a low to medium income family. I have tried borrowing and even forced money from my family members and it has caused a lot of arguments.
We have been living together and she doesn’t do housework either, my parents are the ones doing all the housework while she just does nothing at home and watch her dramas. She doesn’t even offer to buy meals for my parents when they are at home.
She insists that I propose with a diamond ring which will take months for me to save up for, otherwise she says it will make her look bad and she will not marry me, which is why I’m in a dilemma now. I feel that she doesn’t care about my financial pressures and she’s willing to make me suffer for what she wants.
In case you are wondering..she’s not very attractive either. We are both considered unattractive, which is why I hesitate to break up because I know I can’t find someone else. I’ve been wanting to lose weight but she insists I stay fat so I won’t attract other girls, but I am concerned about my health as well.

At the start of CB, she told me that she was bored so I suggested that she can download ML and we can play together. When she ask me to play with her , I decline as I have my own squad mates to play with already so I told her that we will play next time. I don’t know how but she solo-ed and now she is at mythic 200+ points already.
I was impressed so I asked her how she rank up so fast and she told me that she asks her poly friends (almost all are guys) to teach her and played with her. I checked her Instagram and saw all the guys she always played with are handsome guys. Upon seeing this, I was angry and fought with her because she didn’t tell me that she played with so many guys and now she is just a few hundred points away from me. But told me that I played with girls too, but she didn’t mentioned anything at all, and told me that we should just take a break until phase 1 is over which is like probably in July??????
What do I do now??? What if she cheat on me over some guy in ML??? Help please.

My bf’s family is very traditional, and insists that his wife takes on his surname. For me, that would mean changing my title to Mrs Gan, given that Gan is his surname. I find it problematic to have to take on my future husband’s surname in this day and age, but ironically there is an even bigger problem due to my given name. My informal english name that I gave myself is Nina. If you put my english name and my bf’s surname together, I’ll become the laughing stock of others.
My bf also agrees that such a combination is not ideal. He suggests that I change my english name since it’s not legally registered in my legal records. My suggestion is to instead drop the requirement for me to take up his family name. I’m not willing to give up my english name as I’ve used it for many years ever since my secondary school days. Now we’re stuck at this juncture with no one willing to give way. This really sucks.

Just broke up with my boyfriend (you know who you are) over his obsession with Japanese Cartoons. He was so sweet and nice when we first met as friends but as we got closer and closer he started to reveal his degenerate “Otakooo” side.
At first I was pretty ok with it since I thought it was just a minor side interest (we used to go to bar hoping and partying quite a fair bit), but after we started going out he exposed more of more of his disgusting hobby to me. I decided to put up with it since he was such a nice guy but it eventually got on my nerves and I had no choice but to ghost him.
The final straw that made me write this was browsing thru HWZ (thanks to him, ughhhh) and realising that so many of Singaporean guys are also these disgusting, misogynistic ootakoos. My girlfriends tell me that it’s very normal but I just can’t stand the thought of so many Singaporean guys being interested in such immature and disgusting hobbies.

On the other hand, my current BF refuses to get a stable job and instead, works as a food delivery e-scooter rider. He claims he will be able to earn enough to start his online business in about 2 years time. But starting a business in Singapore isn't as easy as he thinks it is.

43157,68906,"Hi, i need some advice here. I have this best friend that i known for more than 10 years since young. Like a childhood friend. We grew up together and were from the same sch throughout till now in NUS. So it started out in sec sch where we got closer and more comfortable with each other, theres this one cca basketball practice where we showered together and were very open with one another.
We became best of bros and everytime i go to his house we are naked studying in his room??? And he even initiated watching porn together(mind u, he is attached with his gf at that time). So i said ok and we somehow became more than best friends. So despite having a girlfriend, we still help each other mutually as we are bro fap buddies. Fast forward, i now have a girlfriend but she says im not forking out enough time for her?? Half the time shes always complaining that i spend more time with my best friend than her but what m i suppose to do when i alr know him for almost a decade??
My gf ever mentioned that shes opened to the idea of a threesome, im not sure if she will be ok with the idea of a 3some with my best friend, seeing that she gets very jealous of our strong friendship most of the time.
I too, am not very sure if i am alright with some guy penetrating her, i dont really like to share my girlfriend as im very possessive and i dont like the idea of her being used by someone else. Im thinking that maybe he can penetrate me instead?
Besides these, my best friend is currently single and i dont want him to feel lonely on his own. I am thinking of proposing the idea of a three-person relationship with her, ill probably be more alright with my best friend screwing her if the 3 of us are in a relationship, but this is so uncommon in singapore n im not sure how it will work out. I rly love my gf, i dont want to lose her or my best friend but i have no idea if she will be open to it, what should i do???

Because some of my friends and cousins are earning much higher than him. I often encouraged him to find a better job. I also asked him to take up some courses to improve his chances. He already took up a few courses but he still couldn't find a better job.
Recently, because of CB, I was bored and downloaded a dating app for fun. Surprisingly, I matched with a lot of guys who seem quite eligible. I even matched with a lawyer and an investment associate. I have been chatting with the investment associate for two weeks now. He would text me only a few times a day because he's a very busy guy. Yesterday was his birthday so he told me he celebrated his birthday with his family at home.
After his birthday celebration, he suddenly said he wants to see me. At around 3am, he snuck out of his house and drove to my house to see me. I went down to the carpark to meet him and was quite surprised to see that he drives a luxury car and he looks even better in real life. We chatted for 2 hours in his car. He then walked me to the lift and even kissed me on my cheek. Although we barely know each other, I actually feel quite happy that he kissed me. When he reached home, he texted me to say that he enjoyed talking to me and he would like to see me again.
He seems like a really nice guy. I know I shouldn't compare but my bf isn't even that nice. My bf is unwilling to come my house during CB. And my bf is unable to find a decent job so I'm worried about my future when we get married. But my bf and I have been together for 3 years so our relationship is very stable. I feel like if I break up with him now, 3 years of my life would be wasted. What should I do? Should I just stick to my bf because he is obviously a safer choice? Or should I continue to go out with the investment guy and then break up with my bf when the investment guy confess to me?

55205,94699,"Should I marry my boyfriend if I’m not physically attracted to him?
I’m 27 years old and my bf is 35. We have been together for 7 years and have just paid the downpayment for our BTO. Our wedding would be held in June this year.
When I first met my bf, I had just gotten out of a two-year relationship with my ex and I only intended to use my bf as a rebound to get over my ex. Since my bf was just a rebound, I didn’t care that he’s ugly. In terms of appearance, he’s at most 5/10 but I’m 8/10. Sadly, he’s also very short and skinny (170cm,62kg). Worst of all, he earns very little ($5k/month). My ideal guy has always been someone who is at least 180cm and earns at least $10k/month.
My bf looks ugly but character wise, he’s the nicest guy I’ve ever seen. Throughout the past 7 years, I have tried dating other men. But the guys I dated were not as nice. Some of them had severe commitment issues and some were assholes who cheated on me. On the contrary, my bf has always been a very loyal and loving bf for the past 7 years. To me, my bf feels like someone I could always depend on and that is why I love him so much.
The only problem that I’m facing is, I am not physically attracted to my bf and I cannot imagine being physically intimate with him. Because of this, I told him that I want to wait until marriage to have sex when in fact I already had sex with those guys I dated in the past 7 years. Up till today, I still feel very guilty for what I have done and this is also one of my biggest regrets.
I feel very guilty that I enjoy getting intimate with other men but I still refuse to get intimate with my bf. Recently, I’m starting to feel very worried about having to get intimate with him after wedding. After so many years, I still feel uncomfortable kissing him and when I kiss him, I always have to imagine I’m kissing my crush. And sometimes I really regret applying for BTO with him. But honestly, I don’t mind dating him. I just don’t know if I should marry him. Has anyone been in my shoes? Has anyone married someone you’re not physically attracted to? Is it possible to have a marriage without physical attraction?

Today I asked my dad to buy me a better car, preferably a first-hand continental car but he said continental cars are too expensive. What the hell? He himself drives a BMW 5 series yet he thinks continental cars are too expensive?? He's being totally unreasonable right? Somemore, it would be so embarrassing to drive a Lancer in front of my friends because Lancer looks so low-class okay.

45616,73996,"TLDR: I broke up with my bf because he's a loner
We've been together for a year and I know him for 2 years. In the two years, he has gone out for dinner 3x with a JC friend, once with a pri sch friend, once with a cousin. That's it. I open his WA and I'm the only one who texts him regularly apart from his parents and siblings.
As a 25 year old guy, I expect you to have some people around you. Relatives, cousins, friends, someone! I'm an introvert too but I find him extreme. He works out by himself everyday, watches football, plays FIFA. I've asked him to at least watch football at a coffeeshop so you are around people, find some football fans online so you can talk to people. He can go weeks without anyone other than me and his fam talking to him. I couldn't stand it. I broke up.
How did he manage to get a gf then? He had so much time on his hands that he was always there for me, every impromptu lunch, every text at whatever time, he replied, he showed up.
Now, I'm moving on with my life but I'm worried for him. He refuses to change himself, he says he likes stability and is working on himself. But you won't grow just by being alone. You grow by talking, sharing, giving and being surrounded by people.
I asked him, ""Have you felt happy in the recent few years?""
He replied, ""No. I feel peaceful and that's enough for me.""
Loneliness is very difficult. I'm worried for him maybe because of guilt but idk what to do for him.

I didn't tell her I actually have a 6 figure savings accumulated from my deceased father's will on top of my own assets and let her think I'm a pauper. She even gave me money once when she thought my family finances was tight but I rejected it. A part of me decided she is the one after she did that.
My mother told me to never flaunt our wealth so as not to attract the wrong people so I guess I start to feel funny about money since young. We mostly go to hawkers and only visit restaurants when there is a special occasion like birthdays or Christmas. Our dates are usually very low costs. I like that when the weather permits, we have the habit of alighting earlier from the train or bus and spend more time walking together and talking to reach our destination.
I lied to her that we can't afford a flat yet and she showed hand me her savings and say she can and kept asking me not to waste her time in a joking way. Her family is pretty well to do. Her dad even gifted her a car when she got promoted but she sold it as she's not confident driving.
The problem I have with my gf may be insignificant to some couples. I don't really have any major red flags or issues about her. Even if she's not my gf, I would think of her as a great person to have around. I know other men will find her very eligible given her looks, personality and family background. My mother loves her and already considers her a daughter in law. But I have a but. I'm not ready. We are in our late 20s.

58807,103530,"tl;dr: I cheated with my female colleague and I feel very bad about it. What made it worse was that my wife witnessed the cheating…
I'm happily married with a wonderful wife with two kids. I work in marketing in an FMCG company and I'm constantly surrounded by younger female colleagues. Ngl, many of them are very attractive but I'm a faithful man who thinks with his bigger head.
However my life recently turned upside down. There's this female colleague who recently joined, let's call her G. G is in her late twenties and has a face and figure many women would die for and many men would go for. I was so surprised to find out that she was single (she gave me that information without me asking). G would constantly ask me for advice dealing with work matters and invite me to go lunch together with her batch. Sometimes we go for lunches and it's just the two of us. G would constantly ask me what I was doing over the weekend and tell me what her plans were. She was actively using dating apps but none of the guys were up to her standards. She would often flirt with me (I think?) Like when we are alone she would playfully brush my arms and sometimes bump into me (too often for it to be by accident). She’d also tell me about her experiences with her dates and how they're not good, and I'm so much better. I always felt a weird sensation whenever I hear that from her. It’s a nice feeling to be validated, but I’m married and it feels wrong.
One fateful day, as my wife had to use the car that day, she came to my office to pick me up. As I was walking away from the office with my wife, G somehow appeared out of nowhere and said hi to us and was extremely friendly towards my wife. G and my wife started chatting as if they were besties and they somehow ended up organizing a games night at my place that weekend. G said she’d bring her date over.
Fast forward to that day, G came with her date. Not sure why but I felt a tinge of jealousy seeing him. We decided to play some card games and I ended up partnering with G. This is when things went down. G was secretly texting me the cards she had in her hand and signaled me to read my phone. I got the hint and was trying to discreetly look at my phone. However, my wife caught me doing that and snatched my phone away and she saw the message from G. She acted like it was ok but after G and date left, she was so furious that I cheated with G during the games and my wife refuses to talk to me now.
How can I appease my wife?

So based on that, she works maybe 14-15 hours every weekday with just 4.5hrs of sleep and a good day every weekend just to catch up on work that couldn't be completed and lesson plans. Based on her salary, it's just ridiculous how much she has to work for that - Retail and F&B workers are better paid hourly than her.
I've been getting into fights with her and telling her that her lifestyle and is unsustainable as it'll lead to big burnouts and her health will suffer. On the flip end, she says that I'm not a teacher and I'd never understand her line of work.
Also, I realised that a lot of her teacher friends (female), are single well into late 30s and 40s - which I guess its due to their teaching lifestyle. On the flip end, most women I know from my line of work (private) are married by their late 30s.
I sincerely hope MOE can do something to lighten teacher's workloads. While that is wishful thinking, I'm wondering if I could get any advice on how to move forward...or move on.
Frankly I although I love her a lot, she had made it clear that her priority is to be a good teacher. So at the back of my mind, there is always this feeling that she loves teaching more than me.
Also, although we both agreed on having children, based on her workload, I don't see how we would be able to manage as I'm afraid she'll leave majority of the child rearing to me while she continues her passion. My job is way less tiring than hers and honestly I'm earning more than double of her - and in order for me to climb more, I need her to do her fair share of child rearing. I've mentioned to her that if we got married, I'd like for her to take a step back from her overloaded schedule and this was utterly shot down and more quarrels ensured.
So now I'm at a crossroads - should I push on and try to make things work, or try to move on to find someone who able to be more family oriented?

41400,65326,"Getting married in a few weeks’ time and discovered that I am pregnant. Thought my missed periods were due to pre wedding stress but the tests confirmed my worst fears. Have always insisted on my fiance wearing a condom because the pill messes with my hormones. Problem is, my fiance is not the father. It’s a colleague who showed concern and care when I was stressed preparing for the wedding and I had moments of weakness with him.
What should I do?
