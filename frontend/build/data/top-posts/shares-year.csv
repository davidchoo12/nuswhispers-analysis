59713,105286,"Hi all, just wanted to let something off my chest. So… I have 4 siblings which are all brothers.( I am a guy btw) The 5 of us are very close since young and we always share things like usage of car, clothes etc.
We are all working adults now and 4 of my brothers can’t find their right one (they are middle age men now). I felt bad for them and asked my wife if she is willing to have sex with my brothers and have a child with each of them to boost their self esteem.
In which, she agreed. (With conditions like 100k for each child birth ) She then had sex with my oldest brother about 5 years ago. Which I have regretted this decision and really defeated every inch of my soul. I cried very badly outside their room that night. Since then she had sex with my 3 other brothers occasionally. I act like I am okay in front of them. But in fact it was killing me inside, each time they had sex.
Today, we each have one child. When I look at my brother’s child, I felt sadness and emptiness in my heart. I start to question myself “what if this child does better than my child”, “what if my wife likes this child better than our child, which cause an impact on our relationship”.
I start to think a lot since the start of the sex with my brothers, which really impacted my mental health a lot as I did not mention to them about my feelings as I do not wish to ruin our relationship, both brother and wife.
I started to have depression and have sucidal thoughts after one month my wife had sex with my oldest brother. Even though this is transactional, but I still felt really bad and felt that my self worth is worse than a bag full of dirt.
Today, when we go out as a family, me, my 4brothers, wife and 5 childrens. I felt very insecure and wish to die everyday. I do not know what is the point in living already. Btw the children all acknowledge me as the dad. As registered in the all their birth cert.
All in all, I do not know why I suggest such a stupid idea. And I really f regret it to the core of my soul.
Please advise how to cope with this… I don’t think I can tahan already

On Friday my mentor said he will treat me to lunch to celebrate my first week at the job; I agreed to the lunch but politely declined the treat, then suddenly he pulled off a Korean CEO move by cornering me into a wall and resting one hand on the wall, saying ""I don't take no for an answer. It's settled."" Unfortunately, his outstretched arm featured a ginormous ARMPIT STAIN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Not only that, on my first day when I passed a comment worrying about whether I will pass probation, he knocked his index finger against my forehand and was like, ""Silly girl. You have me.""

58807,103530,"tl;dr: I cheated with my female colleague and I feel very bad about it. What made it worse was that my wife witnessed the cheating…
I'm happily married with a wonderful wife with two kids. I work in marketing in an FMCG company and I'm constantly surrounded by younger female colleagues. Ngl, many of them are very attractive but I'm a faithful man who thinks with his bigger head.
However my life recently turned upside down. There's this female colleague who recently joined, let's call her G. G is in her late twenties and has a face and figure many women would die for and many men would go for. I was so surprised to find out that she was single (she gave me that information without me asking). G would constantly ask me for advice dealing with work matters and invite me to go lunch together with her batch. Sometimes we go for lunches and it's just the two of us. G would constantly ask me what I was doing over the weekend and tell me what her plans were. She was actively using dating apps but none of the guys were up to her standards. She would often flirt with me (I think?) Like when we are alone she would playfully brush my arms and sometimes bump into me (too often for it to be by accident). She’d also tell me about her experiences with her dates and how they're not good, and I'm so much better. I always felt a weird sensation whenever I hear that from her. It’s a nice feeling to be validated, but I’m married and it feels wrong.
One fateful day, as my wife had to use the car that day, she came to my office to pick me up. As I was walking away from the office with my wife, G somehow appeared out of nowhere and said hi to us and was extremely friendly towards my wife. G and my wife started chatting as if they were besties and they somehow ended up organizing a games night at my place that weekend. G said she’d bring her date over.
Fast forward to that day, G came with her date. Not sure why but I felt a tinge of jealousy seeing him. We decided to play some card games and I ended up partnering with G. This is when things went down. G was secretly texting me the cards she had in her hand and signaled me to read my phone. I got the hint and was trying to discreetly look at my phone. However, my wife caught me doing that and snatched my phone away and she saw the message from G. She acted like it was ok but after G and date left, she was so furious that I cheated with G during the games and my wife refuses to talk to me now.
How can I appease my wife?

59741,105341,"I would like to share my eye opening experiences for the last six months working as a casual worker and the state of how said group of labourers are perceived.
Background info: I come from a privileged background and work for my family business for the last ten years or so after graduation. I haven't been exposed to much hardship with the exception of National Service and a bit of racism in my studies abroad. About 9 months ago, I had a major tiff with my family regarding the direction of our business and we decided that it would be better for me to take time off to collect myself and find my way. It was fun at first to bum around but it got boring quickly.
I read quite a bit and was awed by Einstein's experience as a patent clerk giving him new perspectives and decided to do something similar. I decided to take on any form of casual jobs for half a year with little to no commitment (so I can have the largest possible variety) - my shortest stint was one day and my longest was two weeks.
I gave myself a couple of rules to follow - no using of my car, limiting my spending to 20% of my daily wage, and not to quit no matter bad or tough the job was.
I found these jobs on FaceBook - a cornancopia of opportunities in various casual job groups.
I have worked as a food delivery rider, parcel delivery staff, pet transporter, mover, flyer distributor, general cleaner, IT crew, fishmonger, metalwork crew, AV crew, F&B staff, bar hand, food packer, warehouse operator, aeroplane cleaner, valet driver, durian opener, and a few more jobs.
It has been an eye opening experience working. The main things I noticed is that a good percentage of locals adopt an elitist mentality. Unfortunately, my family is guilty of this and to some extent, I too was. Most are very judgemental of blue collared workers and this is very prevalent in the F&B industry.
Toughest job: Metalwork crew. I had to cut metal objects to salvage profitable parts and it was extremely dangerous with sparks flying and a very dirty environment.
Most enjoyable job: Fishmonger. This was by far one of the most fun I had working as I learned to scale and cut different types of fish. It was also very interesting to work at the fisheries to see all sorts of fish(small ones to huge ones almost half a tonne).
Most interesting job: Valet driver, I witnessed plenty of older married men needing to be sent home/hotels with much younger women. Some of the dross these men say/do with their women in the car have definitely left a mark on me.
Most boring job: Warehouse operator, pretty mundane with too much repetition.
My experience as a bar hand watching guys trying to impress their dates is quite hilarious - I notice guys love to flaunt their wealth when it isn't really great in the grand scheme of things. They tend to treat the bar hands and service staff like crap to look more alpha I'm guessing? Terrible viewing.
Other 'interesting' experience include deliverying parcels to women who receive them not wearing underwear and being pretty nonchalant about it.
Distributing flyers/assisting and moving furniture from showflats to showflats for realtors was a jaded affair - I notice they tend to spew a lot of drivel to the prospective clients with little to no real knowledge about investments as a whole and only seem to care about making a quick buck. Males tend to be nicer to us, offering to buy food if we had worked the whole day without breaks. Females tend to be a bit more picky about not wasting flyers on seemingly unqualified prospects - very judgemental.
Working as an IT crew for tuition centres was pretty sad - I realised a lot of tutors are not really proficient and pretty much reading off their notes. I even noticed a few making mistakes in their lessons - quite alarming.
Cleaning flats and offices was.. peculiar. Some flats were really disgusting and I could not believe people are capable of being so gross and not able to pick up after themselves. Especially tenants moving out, woah. Some flat owners were really nice with isotonic drinks and snacks but the office ones were generally curt and snobbish. A typical HR who was in charge of us(usually middle age woman) would treat us as lesser beings and treat us as such.
Generally, people are quite condescending about lower waged workers and I even saw a few former JC mates brushing me off or being unnecessarily difficult in my experience in F&B. Thankfully, with the mandatory mask, I was never once recognised or questioned. I hope we will be a bit more gracious to people of all sorts of life - no one deserves to be belittled.
Transporting pets was truly amazing, I learned so much how the shelters are in need of help and how these animals truly need our help.
Overall, I made about $12000(close to $10/hour) in these six months and after my daily food and transportation expenses I had about $9000. I have donated this amount to the few shelters and will continue to do so.
I have learned so much for these six months that will echo for the rest of my life and have realigned my perspectives of how I should look at people and my family's firm.
A good two weeks break to decompress and time to get back to bringing our business forward and being a positive member of society.
AMA and I will do my best to reply in a follow-up post.
Always choose to be kind and gracious, it costs nothing.

57717,101452,"I am a 19F local dating a China guy with a really curious trait. Whenever he has trouble remembering how to pronounce cheem-sounding English words, he will transliterate it into Chinese and memorize that instead. For instance, ""s**ual intercourse"" becomes ""谁输儿 阴特扣死“ (shei-shu-er yin-te-kou-si), which I find so funny I make him say it every time he wants to do it.
But yesterday when I was helping him to spring-clean his room for CNY, I stumbled upon this army notebook of his. I recall that he told me as a second-gen PRC he had to serve, and he was a Platoon Sergeant, so I was curious and had a look at what he wrote. Lo and behold, it was full of Chinese transliterations of army commands and on one page, there was a full-blown Tang dynasty-esque poem:
扑了吞吐握右方 (pu-le-tun-tu-wo-you-fang)
扑了吞吐色迪呀 (pu-le-tun-tu-se-di-ya)
可可男露无乳撕 (ke-ke-nan-lu-wu-ru-si)
盘蛋卡拉盘盘蛋 (pan-dan-ka-la-pan-pan-dan)
巴黎死色囊地利 (ba-li-si-se-nang-di-li)
I only recognise ""sediya"" and ""senangdili"" cause I hear that all the time in morning assembly back in school, but the rest look like gibberish. Anyone understand this?

58767,103458,"I have been dating my bf for a while but there are some points that I just cannot shrug off.
The expectation is that a guy should be at least a head taller than his girlfriend, but this is something that can only happen in my dream. The reason is he is only 2cm taller and not even 175cm, meaning that it feels like he is a sister/pal to me rather than an oppa. He is way too short for a guy and it doesnt give me a strong sense of security. I estimate he is in the lower tier of height range perhaps somewhere between 1.70-1.73m.
In fact, I would like to ask my fella ladies out there who are willing to date shorter guys or even marry them. What do you see in them? Dont you regret it after a while or will make this an issue whenever you start quarreling? There are plenty of bigger fishes out there and I am now starting to regret it.
Before you commentors start bashing me, I will be fair and point out some of his merits along with my concerns.
1. Yes, he is pretty good looking and has a nice heart. He often shows care for cats/dogs and feed them but I find this trait less manly and somewhat gross. A real man should be more aggressive, not like a beta sissy that plays with small animals.
2. He often buys lunch for me and brings it to the secondary school where I am teaching. However, sometimes kaypoh students will come to me and ask ""Cher, your boyfriend ah? Legit? Why so short one?""- Not surprising since even my female students are taller than him. This is ridiculously embarassing. I even told my bf not to bring lunch to me but he doesnt get my point... He will just say "" If we are truly in love, we shouldnt care what others say""..... Yeah right you are not the teacher...
3. He will offer to carry the plastic bags whenever we go shopping. The problem is his legs are short so his hands are like in close proximity to the ground, resulting in some long plastic bags being dragged, even though I understand he doesnt mean it. This is pretty unsightly.
4. He is a mathematician and I remembered once he drew me a heart using math equations. This seems romantic to others but lame in my eyes. If he is sincere, he would have drawn the heart by hand, not indulge in these kinds of boring stuff. After all, how can all these math help him in his future prospect? I knew of a few friends already earning big bucks without knowledge of maths.
I do not not wish to elaborate any further because for every merit that I can think of, it is diluted by the negative aspects. They cant even offset his midget stature.
Unfortunately, all the good quality tall guys are already taken by the short girls, otherwise I would have ended this relationship earlier. I do not want my female besties to find out that I broke up, so I will just bear with it for a while.
My message to my fella sisters out there who are currently attached to the shorter guys. It is never too late to back out! Think of your future!

59924,105754,"This is a story that I never told anyone which i should be ashamed but isn’t.
I was 15 when I first met him while playing ml. He was 29. We got matched in the classic game and my stupid ass think he was a god for having 30/1. so i added him and invite him to another game. he ended up with some 20+/0.
I eventually got him to mentor me after pestering on in game chat, hearing his voice the first time made my heart skipped. I would wait for him to get online everyday so I could play with him and listen to his voice. Eventually we started talking on whatsapp. One day i received a text to stay clear of him, it was only then that i knew he had a gf, my heart sank. We didn’t flirt or anything, to me he was that invincible senpai that i admire. i blocked him everywhere the next day.
During my 16th birthday, he texted me, happy birthday in ml. I joked that i wanted a meal for present. we met the very first time in real life after school. he took me to swenson, which to me is like the mother of all restaurant.(I apologize for my 16 year old self) i sat across him, getting a good look at him, it’s great to finally put a face to his voice. He looked like a nerdy Fresh Grad Teacher and yeah that’s like my weakness? We had our meal and catch up a lot on our lives.
After Lunch, he send me home. I don’t know what got over me but i kissed him on the lips for the first time at the lift lobby upon realizing what i had done i ran up the stairs back home and blocked him again.
I kept thinking about the kiss for the next one year and eventually got into JC. Again on my birthday he texted me happy birthday again. But I did not reply because I stalk him on his ig to know that he’s still attached and I didn’t want break their relationship of 5 years.
Extremely stressed over my A lvl and also completely couldn’t get over him, I told myself that if he texted me on my birthday i would hook up to him and get him out of my system. If he doesn’t then i’ll completely give up on him. I know it’s morally wrong to hook up with someone with a gf but it’s driving me crazy. I waited everyday for that day to come reminding myself of what i promised myself.
He did message me Happy birthday. so I took the chance to invite him to repair my computer. (i know it’s a lame excuse i was 18). i met him on the following thursday at noon after school. Upon entering my house, i bolted the door, scaring my parents might come home early. i led him to my room which i locked the door behind. I pushed him onto the bed and after a short persuasion he eventually fell for the temptation.
We agree to keep it physical and behind his gf for a Year. Fast forward, I enjoyed every moment that I spent with him, the memories we had will always be precious. I’ve since return him to his gf as promised and cut ties.
I am 21 now, it’s been two years since he last wish me happy birthday. Even though i misses him, i’ve gotten him out of my system, some part of me still wants him but it’s not that strong. i sometime wonder if I’ll ever find another guy like him.
Dear Ed*****,
I never regretted being yours, I’m glad that it was you. Thank you for fulfilling my unreasonable request. I just wish you’d say happy birthday to me next year. Hope you stay with your gf forever!
Dear GF,
Sorry for stealing your bf for an entire year. I know i’m selfish, but i hope you'll never find out. if you do, please forgive him.

I was continuously surpass by a 3rd class or lower, sometimes from a university that few know of. It's tough to swallow but I've only reached management after I've come to terms with the following
1) Degree, schools and results does not matter.
2) You don't need to be the solution, you just need to look like one.
3) Promotion isn't based on meritocracy, your capability does not matter.
4) Management loves Theatrics, learn to present.
5) Your hard work will only be rewarded with more work.
6) Obedience is valued over facts.
7) Hardest part of the job is politics, if you're in the company, you're in the game.

59377,104647,"Since the academic year is starting and it has been 10 years since I left college, I wanted to share some advice from a spur of nostalgia. My advice is targeted at those who're interested in startups - I've built two companies in the mid-9 figures, exited one of them.
(A) Startups and your major
1. You've heard that execution is more important than the idea. This is untrue. To be more correct, I'd say: conditioned on having an idea, the execution is more important than the idea. It's easy to learn execution, but it's hard to learn how to come up with ideas.
2. There're two classic ways to come up with an idea. One is to throw many lean ideas on the ceiling and see what sticks. The other is to have experienced a problem and know the pain point yourself. The second is much better. But it requires you to have domain expertise in some niche.
3. It's hard to optimize for expertise, but it's easy to set constraints on the niche. A corollary is that it's harder to be successful in a field that's popular (CS, law, medicine) because the competition widens the niche. Another result is that rather than focusing on being the best in your major, it's easier to focus on being the best at some niche smaller than your major.
For me, that was math. Math's a niche by virtue of its unpopularity. But I was only top 250-500 at math (Putnam score). Where I had my real niche was that I was probably fastest 3-5 in the world at transcribing a math lecture live in LaTeX. LaTeX and math gave me my first investor check, because I knew how to typeset legal agreements and syntax in a way that got every most top 50 law firms interested. And though I later pivoted (and that's where execution came into play), that first check gave me the first break in life.
(B) Life hacks
4. Four of the strongest predictors of success are (i) the social circle that you spend 80% of your time with, (ii) how fast you can compound the benefits of learning, (iii) how many decisions you can make in a typical week, (iv) skepticism. There's a selection bias for these, so take these with a grain of salt.
For (i), you'll have already spent most of your time with your best friends by the middle of university, and the frequency that you'll meet them will decrease thereafter. Don't be too attached to them at the expense of your career, and be quick to cut out bad influences. Success will cause you to outgrow some friends.
As for (ii), the more successful you become, the more likely you are to be promoted away from what you were good at or put yourself out of your original job, so you need to be able to learn quickly to overcome this gradient, or your career will plateau.
The early phases of a startup will require you to orchestrate hundreds of decisions per day. The late stages will require you make a handful of good decisions per day. I aggressively cut down my decision fatigue by outsourcing or delegating as much work as possible. This was expensive and not for everyone; I had less than $5k cash in the bank for years while I was a paper millionaire. Also, there's a relation between (ii) and (iii). The less decision fatigue you have, the more time you have to spend on learning.
As for (iv), the world's replete with ways to drain your money (bad) and time (worse). Discipline will help you avoid the obvious 80% of these, but skepticism will save you from the remaining 20% which are much more expensive. This includes wealth advisors at large bank PWMs, people trying to sell you a $M+ investment, a bad hire etc.
5. Set quantifiable personal goals with time targets, and measure how fast you're reaching those goals (i.e. velocity). I do this on a spreadsheet. Velocity tracking is more important than the goals themselves, because feedback is a more powerful force than motivation. One of the arbitrary goals I had was to attain a $10M credit limit by age 27. The goal didn't matter; it ended up taking me a couple more years. But the velocity tracking compelled me to take the actions that led up to it (founder secondary, finding a good PWM, getting a liquidity access line with low SOFR spread).
(C) Finding your significant other
Since you'll likely spend most of your time with your significant other, advice 4 isn't complete without a few pointers.
5. Unfortunately, you'll find that the most eligible pool of people will also tend to be attached and rarely available. This worsens with your target age, so unless you plan on dating someone much younger as you get older, you have a short window of time.
6. The best dating tip I can give is that people like to be a part of your life, and not for you to be a part of their life. So it's important to enrich yourself with experiences and conversational skills. An average-looking person with a healthy physique and a life that others are interested in has better odds of finding a better partner than someone blessed with good looks but a boring life.
7. A discouraging fact is that the person with good looks will still likely land a higher frequency of dates. But the great thing is that finding the best partner is a different optimization from getting the maximum number of dates - would you rather have 50 low quality dates or go on 1 date with and marry the one that makes everyone envious?
8. Find someone who will introduce the most variance to your life, with any positive expectancy.
There's two parts to this. ""Positive expectancy"" - material wealth, quality of intimacy, status, attention, contribution of labor etc. - is the trivial piece, but surprisingly where most life advice is sought. Only you can really tell if someone will have a positive expectancy on your life. I can think of one analogy: My wife went to a college where you must pass a swim test before you can graduate. The test requires that you be able to swim half the distance of the river in front of the campus. Why half? Because if you fall off the bridge and don't know which direction to swim, then no one's going to be able to save you.
""Variance"" is the more important part that people unfortunately tend to overlook. People worry too much if they're with someone who brings them large positive expectancy. It's OK to be with someone who has a small positive expectancy on your life, if that person brings huge variance to your life's outcomes and choices. This might mean someone with whom you'll be able to make tough choices, like sticking through grad school, a work relocation, a big career change, investment risks etc. This might also mean someone who is spontaneous and will encourage you to try new things you otherwise wouldn't. Past a small expectancy threshold, variance has a stronger correlation with happiness.
There's a scene from Interstellar, where the lead actress opined that the planet they were about to explore was too far from the black hole, and consequently wouldn't have the randomness to create the conditions for life. It's easier to find someone who will bring high variance to your life if you make high variance explorations. This means trying things outside your comfort zone, learning a new skill, say a language, or dating someone outside your school or culture. For me, I met my wife online before college, and that brought me to the other end of the world, which set me on this course.
(D) Well-being
9. The pursuit of wealth is a good cause if you make it one. Society will sell you that wealth is ugly. Or that happiness doesn't scale with wealth. I wanted to get a physics PhD and change the world. But I don't regret becoming wealthy. I can say that I'm an order of magnitude happier than when I was only making $200k per year. And it has given me the chance to help many more people.
10. Be happy for others. Several of my classmates got the Rhodes Scholarship. One of them coauthored one of the landmark CRISPR papers with Charpentier and Doudna. Someone applied to my company, got rejected, and later became a paper billionaire. Softbank was one of my investors, and many of my friends through them had 9+ figure exits. One of them was double timing his wife with models and employees, and eventually became mired in scandals that cost his job. Another friend - smarter and more competitive than me - made his first million before me, but took his own life last year.
People around you will become wildly successful, and being able to be happy for them will help you cope with your weaknesses, and make the right moral choices.

58649,103251,"I've been together with my boyfriend for 3 years. Last year he graduated and found a job that pays him $3.5k a month. To be honest I was shocked that his salary is quite low. Because some of my friends and cousins are earning much higher than him. I often encouraged him to find a better job. I also asked him to take up some courses to improve his chances. He already took up a few courses but he still couldn't find a better job.
Recently, I was bored and downloaded a dating app for fun. Surprisingly, I matched with a lot of guys who seem quite eligible. I even matched with a lawyer and an investment associate. I have been chatting with the investment associate for two weeks now. He would text me only a few times a day because he's a very busy guy. Yesterday was his birthday so he told me he celebrated his birthday with his family at home.
After his birthday celebration, he suddenly said he wants to see me. At around 3am, he snuck out of his house and drove to my house to see me. I went down to the carpark to meet him and was quite surprised to see that he drives a luxury car and he looks even better in real life. We chatted for 2 hours in his car. He then walked me to the lift and even kissed me on my cheek. Although we barely know each other, I actually feel quite happy that he kissed me. When he reached home, he texted me to say that he enjoyed talking to me and he would like to see me again.
He seems like a really nice guy. I know I shouldn't compare but my bf isn't even that nice. And my bf is unable to find a decent job so I'm worried about my future when we get married. But my bf and I have been together for 3 years so our relationship is very stable. I feel like if I break up with him now, 3 years of my life would be wasted. What should I do? Should I just stick to my bf because he is obviously a safer choice? Or should I continue to go out with the investment guy and then break up with my bf when the investment guy confess to me?

57994,102001,"I’m having a physical affair with my helper. I know this is wrong but I don’t know what to do. This started mid last year and we both secretly get together whenever we are alone at home. I started developing feelings for her when once she helped me with a body massage. Things escalated from there and now I’m unable to stop myself. We click very well and i think there’s a big attraction between us.
We do keep our personal moments off from the family time. When it comes to her work and household chores she takes care of everything very well. She has never taken advantage of the situation and failed to work properly because of our affair.
The problem is i think my mum (staying with us) sensed something recently and ever since she has been insisting on sending our helper back home. She keeps finding fault with her which was not the case in the past. I really don’t want her to be sent back as this is not her fault. She has a family to feed back home and i feel very guilty.
But I can’t speak about this to anyone. I can’t even bring myself to ask my friends for advice. I’m also very worried that my mum might say something about this to my husband. Till date he hasn’t sensed anything and I didn’t deprive him of anything because of what i get with our helper. But I’m just very scared and worried. I still love my husband and i care for our helper too.

59072,104063,"Tl;Dr - most people who have children, don't seem to fully understand what they are getting into.
As I am at the age where most of my friends are married and having children/had children, many around me have started to ask why is my wife and I not having any yet.
The answer is simple. Unless you truly want to have children, and you want to devote your time towards nurturing a child, you should not have children. This answer often makes people around me uncomfortable as it seems like it is a direct jab at their life choices.
Many around us tend to have children simply because it seems to be the ""next step in life"". Or perhaps as some form of insurance against old age as they may have a child or two to care for them as they age. Sure, these are valid reasons as long as you nurture and love your children.
But this is where it all goes downhill. Where parents only want to enjoy the fun parts of parenting, and dump the rest to everyone and everything else around them.
Instead of spending quality time educating and nurturing the child, many young parents like to whip out the iPad so the child can go on ""autopilot"" mode and they can use their mobile phones or computers in peace. The amount of actual human interaction that the child receives is what helps to nurture and allow the child to grow as an intellectual.
Children are brought to the world by their parents and if their own parents don't even want to spend time with them, then what kind of a childhood are these children going to go through? It takes a lot of real love and patience to really nurture a human being, and it simply cannot be reduced to 30 minutes of interaction spread across a day. Let alone treating your ""insurance"" as a side piece.
After years and years of watching how people can say things like ""Parenthood is the best thing that can happen to you"" or ""the sacrifice is all worth it"" while whipping out the iPad at the dinner table for their child and blasting Baby Shark while the domestic helper attempts to feed the child, I've come to the conclusion that it is no easy feat being a parent. A true parent, not a sperm donor or egg incubator.
I know that this post will likely not make any difference, but I would like to suggest to couples that are considering to have children, to really understand what you are getting yourselves into. Should you choose to embark on the journey of Parenthood, I applaud you and sincerely hope you nurture a good and responsible human being to be part of our society.

59530,104917,"I'm currently dating a teacher for about 2 years, who is 3 years into the job (after PGDE). While we really love each other and are serious about one another, I'm a bit uncertain about our future together due to her workload and commitment to work.
Here is a sample of her average day:
Wake up at 540am
Leave house at 630am
Reach school by 710am
Teach classes till 130-2pm
CCA/ remedials/ meetings/ misc things till 530pm, leave school
Dabao, Reach home at 630pm
Eat dinner and chill to 8pm
Marking from 8 to 1130pm
Shower, etc, till 1230pm
Catch up on emails till 1am then sleep
So based on that, she works maybe 14-15 hours every weekday with just 4.5hrs of sleep and a good day every weekend just to catch up on work that couldn't be completed and lesson plans. Based on her salary, it's just ridiculous how much she has to work for that - Retail and F&B workers are better paid hourly than her.
I've been getting into fights with her and telling her that her lifestyle and is unsustainable as it'll lead to big burnouts and her health will suffer. On the flip end, she says that I'm not a teacher and I'd never understand her line of work.
Also, I realised that a lot of her teacher friends (female), are single well into late 30s and 40s - which I guess its due to their teaching lifestyle. On the flip end, most women I know from my line of work (private) are married by their late 30s.
I sincerely hope MOE can do something to lighten teacher's workloads. While that is wishful thinking, I'm wondering if I could get any advice on how to move forward...or move on.
Frankly I although I love her a lot, she had made it clear that her priority is to be a good teacher. So at the back of my mind, there is always this feeling that she loves teaching more than me.
Also, although we both agreed on having children, based on her workload, I don't see how we would be able to manage as I'm afraid she'll leave majority of the child rearing to me while she continues her passion. My job is way less tiring than hers and honestly I'm earning more than double of her - and in order for me to climb more, I need her to do her fair share of child rearing. I've mentioned to her that if we got married, I'd like for her to take a step back from her overloaded schedule and this was utterly shot down and more quarrels ensured.
So now I'm at a crossroads - should I push on and try to make things work, or try to move on to find someone who able to be more family oriented?

He is always by my side whenever I feel depress, cheering me up with magic tricks. Although he knew that I'm already attached, he continued to shower me with affection and love. Instead of rejecting him, I led him on by asking him to hug me when I'm sad. Kiss him on the cheek when he sent me back home. (Well, as long as I didn't engage in s**ual activity with him, I'm not cheating on my bf) .
I did clearly explained to him that, there is a very low probability of me becoming his gf. However, he gave me a shocking reply that touched my heart deeply and brought me to tears. Although he knew that he has little or no chance, he is unwilling to abandon a vulnerable girl like me. He wants to stay by my side to protect my fragile heart until the day I no longer needs him. When that day arrives, he will cut all contacts from me in order to nurse his emotional wounds.

59716,105292,"I slept with my girlfriend’s sister 5 years ago
Me and my gf now trying to bto and get married soon after 3 years of dating. I knew my gf got a younger sister but I have never met her or seen her pic as my gf is a very private person even on social media. Last week, my gf brought me to meet her family for the very first time to discuss about our marriage. That was when I first met her sister and realised she was the one I ghosted when I was 18 yo after we slept tgt. I ghosted her because she lied about her age on tinder. I won’t disclose her sister’s age but it was a one time thing and I felt horrible after knowing the truth.
I pretended that I didn’t recognised the sister during the dinner and kept calm so that my gf won’t suspect anything. Everything went well until later that night I received a text msg from her sister, asking if I rmb what happened 5 years ago and asked why I ghosted her. She also said that she couldn’t stop thinking about me and felt very hurt after I ghosted her.
I just told her that I was only looking for hookups on tinder during that time and got hurt because she lied about her age. I also told her to keep this a secret from my gf and just let it go as it was 5 years ago where we were still young and not know better. She agreed that we should let it go. This conversation happened earlier this year, so it has been awhile.
But recently, my gf has been asking me about my past hookups/rls. This make me panic a lot because I told her before about my past, so I don’t know why she is asking it now. I suspect her sister told her smtg because my gf keep asking me what exactly did I do 5 years ago when I was in my dating app phase. Do I come clean to her and tell her about her sister as I only had one hookup during that phase and ntg more? Or do I just say I had one hookup and not tell her it’s her sister? What should I do? Pls send help.

58900,103714,"I fell for a Siam bu.
Before u guys judge me, please hear me out. I often frequent Thai disco / Siam Diu as a means to de-stress. I find that the loud music and spinning lights help take the stress away from my work.
Like any other visit, I sat at my usual spot when a petite silhouette from afar caught my attention. Her round eyes, sharp nose, and elongated legs is what many would consider ""attractive"". Not to mention that her long and silky hair that is constantly brushing against her shoulder line; any man would subconsciously gravitate toward her and I was no exception.
I could not help but to glance in her direction without making it too obvious. I got caught eventually and we exchanged eye contact for a good 10 seconds. She understood the assignment and came over for a chat. As we began sharing more about each other, I realized that we have many things in common. We immediately clicked as though we had known each other right from the beginning. She introduced herself as ""Moon.""
At that moment, I felt as though I had found my soulmate. Talking to Moon made me forget about my fatigue from work. It was as though time had stopped. Deep down, I was sincerely hoping that the conversation could last forever. Time flew quickly, and before I knew it, the place was closing for the night. We exchanged contact and parted ways.
The next day, my phone rang. On answering, I was greeted by a familiar voice. It was Moon. My face lit up knowing that I could connect with her again. We agreed to meet up at a Thai restaurant called NaNa at Golden mille.
NaNa restaurant is a famous Thai restaurant in SG. Moon claimed to be a frequent patron of the place as their food tasted close to home. She even use the opportunity to teach me the name of the dishes in Thai. Halfway through our meal, she was rudely interrupted by a phone call which led her to leaving the restaurant. She claimed that she had something urgent to attend to, and needed to excuse herself. She sounded anxious.
Feeling concerned, I quickly paid the tab and followed her. I was soon led to one of the floor exits where I found her seated on the stairs and sobbing uncontrollably. I approached her to check on her. My presence caught her off guard and, almost immediately, she apologized for leaving me alone in the restaurant. She then went on to explain what happened. Turns out, her mom was terminally ill, and needed money for her operation. Sympathizing with her plight, I agreed to help her out without much hesitation.
As I was about to get up and make the withdrawal. She grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her. She gave me a peck on my cheek to express her gratitude. Things got heated up and we made love in a public space. Despite the shabby location, the sex was good and memorable. The day ended on a good note with her settling her family matters with my financial support.
That incident pulled us closer as we started hanging out more. Despite numerous warnings from my friends and family about her intention, I chose to believe her as I felt that the society perception towards hostress is based on stereotypes. Things, however, did get dubious when she started asking for more money...
P.S I realized the story is getting too lengthy and I apologized. I'll split the story and post the part two if the post hits 200 likes

My husband and I are both high level executives at tech companies. We both draw decent six-figure salaries and have a comfortable life. However, the way my husband runs our household makes me worry quite a lot. He runs the house as if it's a company, with goal setting, performance evaluation and what not. Some of the crazy things he has enforced on us:
- Bi-weekly sprint meetings and retros where we meet to discuss how far along we are in achieving in terms of our career growth, personal growth and fitness
- Quarterly OKRs for our son who is in Primary school
- He made our son set goals for his exam grades, e.g. 95 for English, 100 for Math, etc
- He created dashboards to track our combined income and expenditure, goal progress, etc
- Biannual performance review where we give each other feedback and he decides a rating for us. He will also give an overall family rating depending on our overall performance
- Our family holiday locations and the budget are determined by our family rating. The higher the rating, the better the location (ranging from Maldives to Sentosa)
- Every half, we do roadmapping and each of us have to also talk about how we envision ourselves and the family to be in the next few years and propose changes
I'm a bit afraid for my son that he's growing up in such a stressful environment and have an abnormal childhood. Will this be the case or am I worrying over nothing?

58851,103627,"My fiance has lost money on TerraLuna.
We have been saving up since secondary school. We have plans to BTO, raise beautiful kids and go on dream vacations. All these have come to a naught within a span of just a few days.
The idea of investing in cryptocurrency was first introduced to him by his circle of close friends. He was made to believe that he can make a quick buck and retire early. He took his friends words for it and dabbled into crypto trading.
There were occasions where he would boast to me that he had made a killing which would enable us to realize our dream quicker. Given the volatility of such investment, he assured me that he is well aware of the risk and persuaded me to join as well. Considering that his decision meant well for both of us, I decided to follow suit and entrust my life savings to him in hope that he will not disappoint me.
I should have known better not to do it when he began distancing himself from me and stayed silent on Whatsapp over the past few weeks. Being a concerned partner, I reached out to him to find out how he is doing and to check on our investment. When the topic of investment is raised, he would flare up for no reason and would shout at me over the phone.
A few days ago, a crypto-coin known as TerraLuna (or whatever they call it) made headlines for losing all of its value with allegations made against the founder for fraud.
Worried that it would impact our investment, I phoned my fiance but failed to reach him. I tried to dial his friend only to find out that he had put all his money in this so-called coin only to lose everything. Upon hearing the news, my heart sunk knowing that our hard-earned money were gone and our dreams destroyed. The last I heard about him was from his friend who told me that he had to resort to borrowing from loan sharks in hope to recover his losses only to end up losing more.
We have plans to hold our wedding in Dec which was made known to everyone early this year. Now we have to call it off because of his silly mistake. I can no longer see a future with him and I certainly do not see myself helping with his debt. Heck, I am even contemplating doing OnlyFans to re-build my wealth.
I am v lost as to what to do and how to break the news to everyone about our wedding dismissal should they question about it due to this incident.

59721,105306,"I am 30 years old male, married with 1 kid and already moved into our new BTO.
Wife and I met 8 years ago, got married 2 years ago and have a kid 1 year ago.
Starting of the relationship was ok, she is ok for me to smoke and portray herself as those very nice and understanding woman. Slowly 1 year into the relationship, her true colour slowly review itself. She say I smell so bad after smoking and refuse to kiss me. I respect that as non smokers usually dislike the smell. So everytime when I’m out with her, I would leave my cigarettes in the car. I have to pay for every single thing and dinner at coffee shop seems unbearable for her.
Moving forward a bit, we had a huge quarrel with her about 4 years into the relationship as she found out that I owe my credit card debt for about 14k. FYI, I don’t buy stuff for myself, I don’t drink, don’t party and don’t game. All my money were basically spent on her and us. She love to compare me and her life with those influencer’s and their boyfriend. Her attitude towards me is like towards a dog and she constantly scolds me with vulgar everytime she has mood swing. Her mood swing can be a weekly thing which traumatised me a lot. And she chose to dump me knowing that I am on debt. Felt really hurt inside as I chose to put myself in debt just so I can spend on her and let her lead the kind of life she wants to, but it’s still not enough to satisfy her. I chose to accept and left. And it was just that day itself when I got dumped, a very good female friend of mine since poly days contacted me and asked me out to chill, so since I’m down, I said ok and met up with her. Told her exactly what happened and she told me if she has a boyfriend like me, she would cherish so much and never let go (she knows how I treated all my exs and we were there for each other everytime we have BGR issue).
So I joking said, “when is our turn to be together?” , and she say actually she likes me too and if I have the same feeling towards her too, we can get together. I’ve read stuff online saying that best friend who got married usually last forever. We know exactly how our past were like, as such we will not quarrel over a lot of stuff new couples might face. I told her that I’m in debt and not able to buy her stuff and bring her for holidays, and she say she is ok to be the one paying and ok to eat bread with me until I clear off my debts. I’m so touched inside and I admit I had a crush on her before, and we got together.
Few weeks went by, my ex that I mentioned above came calling me, texting me and even came to my house begging me to come back and giving all the reasons that she could think of and how remorseful she were. I rejected her and said nasty things to her but she was very determined to get me back. Ultimately, still not moved on yet from her, I chose to let down my best friend and got back to her and indeed she was a changed person. But it was the worst decision I have ever made in my life. Shortly after we reconcile, probably 1 year later, her pattern came back and it got even worse. Nearing to our bto completion, I have to follow the flow and proposed to her, got married and move in our new house.
We had a child and I did everything I can to help. From feeding, to bathing to washing and cleaning, from doing ALL household chores and wash clothes mop floor hang clothes keep clothes wash milk bottle sterilised bottle, I paid for house renovation loan, wifi, utility bills, milk powder and every single meal including breakfast to dinner. She was not satisfied. She still compare her life with me with influencers. She said what I did was what I should as a husband and daddy and that I never do anything for her but only for our child. She complains how I never bring her to holiday after giving birth a child for me and says I never buy branded bags for her anymore. Honestly, I’m in debt again and I can’t tell her. She is the type that I can’t share any of my unhappiness or difficulties to her because she will have an even bigger reaction.
When baby is sick, we all can’t sleep and she will start go crazy shouting at our infant baby and telling me how I didn’t help her and even say she has market value still and don’t dare her to go look for another older richer man. She has been scolding vulgar to me and threatening to divorce me. I really don’t understand what have I done wrong or what have I not done enough. When I’m tired from work, she says don’t bring work back home ad affect the family, but she does that herself every single day. If it wasn’t for my child, I would have fought back and agree to a divorce. I’m so lost now.

57856,101703,"I read here about marriage proposals that went wrong - guys not putting in enough effort etc. But marriage is so much more than just a proposal... there are so many other factors to consider.
I will tell you after 21 years of marriage... don't marry unless you are very sure.
We went to pre-marital workshops talk about anything under the sun. Talking is easy.
Doing chores, having kids, and even having s** is difficult.
Firstly, we had never even gone travelling alone before marriage, never stayed together at all before marriage.
It's ok if both parties are serious about making it work..however sadly people change. I feel like I ended up getting a shock. My hubby has never cooked nor has ever done a day of chores in his life.
We didn't even know how to have s**. We needed to read books about it.
We didn't even know that we both have fertility issues. We took three years to have our first child with clomid and 6 years to have our kids via ivf.
And when it came to kids - the person who usually ends up giving up their job to take care of them is the women. So the hubby who had promised to have a joint account at the start of the marriage suddenly decided to have an individual account.
Suddenly you realise all the promises of your money is my money and my money is your money is all nonsense... he changed. Knowing he is the sole breadwinner, he decides how much to give you and he keeps his own account from you.
He bought his ""own car"", changed his job to do anything he wants as he has his own money.
Suddenly, after 21 years of marriage, you realised you had sacrificed so much for the family (inhections, iui, ivf) but your husband acts like a single man.
He enjoys playing with the kids, but disciplining them and managing their studies, their handphone usage, their meals... all lies on your shoulders.
He continues to game and does not help with chores. He even continues watching p*rn as if he was single.
Then you realised - why did you even marry in the first place?
The diamond, the promises that he will continue to love and protect you and do all the chores are just nothing but lies.
He just enjoys the fact that he has a family so he won't be lonely. But other than that, he continues his single lifestyle.
So ladies, please open your eyes big big... don't look at the proposal, don't look at the diamond, the bank account, the house, the car, the degree.
Know if he is the guy you can spend the rest of your life with. As he is now, not what you hope he will be.
We are usually maternal and might give up everything for our family.
If given another chance... I would rather wait till I find a more suitable guy who truly loves me and keeps the marriage vows, than someone who will only keep the vows if you don't disturb his gaming or interfere with his money.

57933,101855,"Need to rant. My ex-boyfriend is so cheapskate. Today he suddenly texted me and asked me if I could return him the engagement ring that he proposed to me with.
We dated for 4 years before he proposed to me in August last year. A month later, he quit his job because he wanted to start a business with his friends. I then broke up with him as I felt very disappointed with his stupid start-up dreams. Fortunately I met someone new at my workplace who’s way more mature and financially stable than him so I managed to quickly move on.
So today he told me he would like to sell the engagement ring as he would like to expand his business. I asked him why bother selling this ring as it’s not that expensive anyway. He then said that this ring costs alot to him as he saved up for 2 years to buy it because he knew that it was my dream to own this ring. Playing the sympathy card. Yikes.
To be honest this ring is not really super expensive, at most $60k? So I don’t understand why he is so determined to take it back. I am seriously disgusted with how thick-skinned he is, how he tries so hard to convince me to return him the ring. Somemore he already know that it is my dream to own this ring.
But when I told my friends about this, they all told me I should return him the ring and support him in his start-up dream and then ask my current boyfriend to buy me a new one. Seriously how to support such stupid dream? So should I return him the ring or not? I have the right to reject him right?

60172,106218,"My advice to all young gentlemen out there
Don’t get married. Yep. I said it. DO NOT GET MARRIED. It’s a scam that’s so normalized that nobody even realizes it’s a scam.
I mean it. And I am not some bitter old man. On the surface I appear to be a moderately successful professional married to another (seemingly) successful white collar professional, and let me tell u… I am miserable af.
Marriage is basically like doing half the household chores like a housemate (nowadays the girls all want to split household chores), and yet you’ll be paying for everything, fetching her around like a taxi driver, carrying her shopping bags, and whole be busy helping somebody’s dustyass daughter run errands.
God only knows why I signed up for this shit show. My life would probably have been a lot better if I didn’t get married and remained single.
Don’t just take my word for it. ALL of my married gentlemen friends regret getting married and none of them would want to get married again if they could turn back the clock.
Some of them are now divorced, and still having to co-parent with a shitty ass girl who’s out to make their lives miserable & on top of that are horrible shitty mothers.
Most girls nowadays aren’t looking for a husband. They just want a new daddy who can pamper them like princesses. Bonus if the new daddy is good looking and/ or has a nice body they can get whacked by at night. That’s all they’re after.
I’ve no doubt that the comments will be filled with these pathetic woman-children whining about how women bring nothing to the table.
We are the whole dining room set from IKEA, b*tch. We make our own money, we buy our own shit, we can cook our own meals and we can make ourselves cum better than u ever can.
What do *YOU* bring to the table, besides a bland AF personality (hehe bubble tea is my personality, I love K-pop uwu), zero dress sense (let me guess- your whole wardrobe is from Taobao & Charles and Keith), average pay check ($3-5k LOL) and average boobs (A/B LOL)?
So pls for the love of God, gentlemen don’t get married. Listen to me. Don’t make the same shitty mistake I and along with so many other ladies made. You’ll thank me in the future when you watch all your other friends get married and then divorced.
And the G wonders why the marriage and birth rate are dropping year after year. Look at the quality of the guys. Totally CMI.
The gentlemen have been stepping up and most of us are doing household chores and cooking great food, contributing to the household; as compared to our parents generation.
But women? Can’t even fry an egg to save her own life, and have to rely on grab to order every dinner. Yet every expense don't wanna pay. Hard pass.
If you’re already engaged it’s not too late. Call it off. I don’t care if you’ll lose money. Better to lose money than your time. It’s also much worse and much more expensive to get a divorce.
If you’re dating, just date her for fun. Date her yo satisfy your own needs and for companionship, but focus on your own career and yourself. Don’t need to get too serious. Treat her as a fun hobby. Nothing more. No need to legally bind yourself to one person. Women's charter isn't funny.
And if she’s not treating u like an absolute king while you’re dating, PLS don’t waste your time. She’s not going to step her game up after marriage. If she’s not at least a 9.5/10 during courtship, don’t bother. It’s only downhill from there. If she’s only a 5-6 now, he will be a 1-2 after marriage. Confirm plus chop. Don’t say nobody tried to warn u.

He usually wears shirts and all so you can't see his watch or his religious bracelet.....
So one day I jio him bowling near my house and I invited my crush along.....
All is going well as usual he's making his jokes etc. and my crush is laughing.
Halfway through our second game, he's got 7 strikes in a row and he just rolls up his sleeves, boom what I see was a AP worth at least $100k
There my crush goes asking him all's sort of new questions etc. and she's basically throwing herself at him....
My heart sank, he saw all this and texted me ""bro let's test her"".
So I said oh I have to go etc. and left her and him there
What happened was she asked him to ""teach"" her how to bowl and was touchy.
Lied she stayed in the same neighborhood as him just to get a ride in his car...btw he doesn't use his family car at all, he said he'll get his own.
When he said oh no I like the MRT it's faster for me, she said ""you are a rich guy you must have a nice car right??""
He ""my family has their own car which is for them to use not me""
She called his family selfish....
So she then asked if they can hangout at his place (landed home).
She spent the rest of the evening trying to sleep with him after seeing all the expensive paintings in his house, and his dad's friends rolls Royce.
Whom she assumed it belonged to his family....
After he told her he ain't interested she came crawling back to me

59822,105532,"When you cause me so much anger and pain and not see what you have done to me.
She was my gf for almost a year. Out of the few girls that I've dated, she was the hottest one. I admit I am a very confident man. I workout and lift weights and I am tall at 1.85cm while she's 1.65cm. I always believe we look very good together and I am the envy of many men for having her as my gf. People always look our way when we walk past and I was sure it's because we are a very good looking couple.
We always argued. I was often angry. She cannot see how much frustration she has brought me. She cannot see when its clearly her fault when things happen. I don't believe no other guys are chasing her when we are together and I admit I let my anger get the better of me sometimes. She has many unknown calls and she would always deny it when I ask if it's from other guys. If you have unknown calls why won't you delete it if it's really from a stranger? Why keep the number on the log? A few times she threw her phone because she was so angry by what I've found on her phone and social media. If you have nothing to hide, why get mad? I deleted all her phone numbers as I was sure she was saving numbers under girls names when its actually guys numbers.
I kept saying she will cheat on me one day and she really left me one day. Then she got together with another guy barely 2 months after we broke up. I was still in the process of trying to get her back as we always patch back but it stopped working. So many times I caught him sending her home and it made me so mad. I made sure she remembers I will forever be single thanks to a cheater like her. Towards the end it was really ugly and I wanted to get back at her. I didn't want to give her the satisfaction so I destroyed everything of hers that she left at my home. I never forgot the way she insulted me. I did hope she is never happy forever for how she ended our relationship. I made sure she heard even my mum cursed her for causing me so much unhappiness.
That guy she dated was so short. I don't know what she sees in him. I always believed she got together with him to spite me. I was sure he can't satisfy her better than me. He don't even have half my stature or presence. He doesn't even drive a car like me. I find it unbelieveable that after me, she actually married that short guy and had a child with him.
I cannot get over the fact after leaving me, she married the first guy who wanted her. I know how to enjoy life while she chose to suffer with that poor short chap? When I meet or bump into mutual friends who also knows her, I feel my anger and bitterness coming back each time. I purposely flirted with her besties once when I bumped into them. I wanted them to tell her how happy and happening I am without her. And I have no lack of women surrounding me.
A part of me deeply wishes she suffer whenever I am reminded of her. I even purposely move around her workplace hoping she will bump into me and I hope she regrets letting me go as I am successful and earn more than her dwarf husband now.
I hope you remember me forever because you've been such a horrible person to me.

58793,103506,"Manly guys should be hairy - that has been my opinion since puberty, so I have never shaved in my life, and I admire my armpit hair at least once a day in front of the mirror. I like exercising topless at parks and gyms, where I spend most of my time at the pull-up bars so I can flaunt my hairy armpits and make manly grunts that would arouse the opposite s**. However, the number of girls who would look lustfully in my direction has diminished over the years to an alarming zero.
To combat this, recently I have taken to frequenting nearby 7-11s after my workout, giving a free show of my topless sweaty body to any surrounding females. I even raise my arms in the pretense of stretching so that they can enjoy an unimpeded view of my erotic armpits, but even the cashier avoided my gaze. I don't know what else I can do apart from bellowing out loud: ""BEHOLD MY MANLY ARMPIT HAIR!""

59805,105494,"I just wanna remind everyone that while you chase greater and greater things in your life, don't forget to ask yourself all the time ""am I happy?""
A lot of times we chase things without really trying to understand whether it is what we truly want to do. We may end up very successful but empty inside. Or we may not end up successful at all, and feel depressed that we didn't become the person we think we deserve to be. I write this more to remind the highest achievers, that just because you do very well in school doesn't mean that you should feel the need to make as much money as possible. It also doesn't necessarily mean you have what it takes to make a lot of money. A lot of very highly qualified people in Singapore are working middle-class jobs because of absolutely idiosyncratic reasons. It could also be because they suck in the real world. I have met very educated people who were perfectly happy pursuing a simple job with less pay than they could have gotten, because either the job is something they love doing and therefore better at, or their job allowed them to do other things that may not pay at all but are nevertheless valuable.
Two months ago, my friend's friend's son ended his life. He was a remarkable student. He went to Hwa Chong, Imperial, and then MIT. Brilliant brilliant kid. Absolutely brilliant in math. After he graduated he started working at a very very famous investment bank. He ended his life on the 5th year. I then found out from his parents that he always talked about becoming a teacher/lecturer growing up, but chose to go into banking for the money.
Not everyone who did very well in school find joy pursuing careers that pay a lot of money. Not everyone who did very well in school have the competence and characteristics to do equally well at any job. Even if the stars align, doing well in school doesn't even remotely measure your management skills. Which means even if you have the most prestigious degrees, you may find yourself stuck in middle-management because you just do very low-value stuff very well, or you do high-level technical stuff very well but nobody is paying you for that talent. Also, not everyone who did very poorly in school wouldn't one day find something to do that would pay them a lot more than a Harvard student. As an exercise, I'm sure you know of Singaporeans who are immensely wealthy who didn't have much schooling. Sheng Siong, BreadTalk, Hotel 81, HaiDiLao etc. These are all very idiosyncratic as I said.
So by all means do well in school, but also know that to make a lot of money requires a special sauce that your professors wouldn't know of. Very few people would know what it takes. And also, quit obsessing over making tons and tons of money and obsess over doing something you absolutely love. You will never do very well in the things you don't enjoy doing anyway. So pursuing a career because it pays more, not because you are interested and passionate about it, may not even be the most optimal decision. i.e You may actually end up making a lot less.

There was once, I was looking to sunat and found a doctor to do it but she got angry with me and wanted to break up with me. From then on, I didn’t dare to sunat nor wash my “there” as I was worried she will break up with me. It got to a point where it was so smelly that the itch was unbearable and I had to see a doctor. The doctor was shocked at the look of it when he examined and suggested that I will need to start washing if not it will get worse. I then explained the situation to him and soon after he started covering his nose and said that this is abnormal.
I consulted my friends and they soon started saying that it is not normal. But I read online somewhere that they to understand each other’s differences. So I’m still thinking about it that should I wash or not wash? The itch is unbearable.

58648,103256,"My girlfriend and I met in the first year of uni. when I first lay my eyes on her, I knew she was the one. However, there was only one problem: she was attached. But I was going to overcome this hurdle nonetheless, afterall we were studying in an overseas uni and her boyfriend was in the army. I knew I could come in between their LDR - it was just a matter of time.
In addition, I knew i had a height advantage - I was 190cm and he was only 172cm. I feel like my looks are above average as well so I think that helped me in a way. On a normal day, I would ask when she was going to call her boyfriend so I could give her time and space. But in my heart I secretly wanted her all for myself.
I waited patiently, for my time to strike. It had been a few weeks now and I thought about how to disrupt their daily calls as they were still going strong. Thus, I had to purposely ask her to go for random courses and classes in the evening, as that was the only time she could call her boyfriend (due to the time difference between singapore and UK). Slowly but steadily, she started to reschedule or even cancel the calls with her boyfriend - to my pleasure.
She slowly grew attached to me, and told me some heartfelt thoughts like how she felt distant with her boyfriend. She asked me for advice of what to do and obviously I had to sow discord between them and even made her doubt their relationship.
In addition, I used a fake instagram account that I bought online to mask myself as some ex classmate of hers (let's call her Jane) and saying things like how her bf was cheating on her. Finally, the turning point in their relationship came. The LDR, constant fights and distrust became too hard to bear. They broke up and she naturally came falling into my arms.
I feel bad and actually guilty for doing such things thats why I'm writing this confession. My question to you guys is that if you were in my shoes, what would you do for love? what boundaries would you break and what morals would you shatter - to attain this entity we call love?
TLDR: Just because there is a goalkeeper, dosent mean you cannot score a goal. I hope this story inspires people out there whose crushes are attached, where I want you guys to know that nothing is impossible, just follow your dreams.

She even gave me money once when she thought my family finances was tight but I rejected it. A part of me decided she is the one after she did that.
My mother told me to never flaunt our wealth so as not to attract the wrong people so I guess I start to feel funny about money since young. We mostly go to hawkers and only visit restaurants when there is a special occasion like birthdays or Christmas. Our dates are usually very low costs. I like that when the weather permits, we have the habit of alighting earlier from the train or bus and spend more time walking together and talking to reach our destination.
I lied to her that we can't afford a flat yet and she showed hand me her savings and say she can and kept asking me not to waste her time in a joking way. Her family is pretty well to do. Her dad even gifted her a car when she got promoted but she sold it as she's not confident driving.
The problem I have with my gf may be insignificant to some couples. I don't really have any major red flags or issues about her. Even if she's not my gf, I would think of her as a great person to have around. I know other men will find her very eligible given her looks, personality and family background. My mother loves her and already considers her a daughter in law. But I have a but. I'm not ready. We are in our late 20s.

59870,105641,"I encourage cheating, and here is why.
This might be a controversial take, but my partner and I have cheated multiple times. It does not sour our relationship at all. In fact, I feel that allowing it to happen strengthens our bond and builds trust. We all have our needs, wants and desires, and sometimes we are unable to fulfill it with just one person.
Not to discredit my partner as she is a nice and intelligent person, but she is not good at everything, and I admit that I am not either. So sometimes we have to look for other partners to fulfill our needs.
We try not to get caught but nowadays technology is making to pretty difficult. For example, our last ordeal was when they actually shuffle the questions AND answer choices so even when I'm right beside my partner, her ""Question 4"" and my ""Question 4"" is totally different, which makes it so much harder to cheat because we can't simply whisper the question number and answers to each other.

To provide some context, i was previously a loner with no friends. I had only my Pokémon cards to provide me accompany.
She complains that I am always going back to the mall, spending hours at the card shop looking at Pokémon cards and spending excessive amount of time online.
She calls it a fetish.
After 1 month of us being together, she decided to give me the ultimatum. Give up my Pokémon cards or her.
I am in a serious dilemma now.
Should I get the dark charizard next or the dark dragonite next?

59355,104605,"There I was having dinner with my son when I notice them. A couple sitting near us. Both of them glued to their phones minding their own business while munching their food. Zero interaction.
My first impression with them was harsh. ""Going out on a date and still on their phones? What's the point?"" Then suddenly the boy show the girl something on the phone and the girl responded with a smile.
I notice the guy's dressing. Tee shirt with some anime characters, jeans. He is a typical geeky looking guy. No toned muscles or good physic, thick glasses, abit messy hair. He definately didn't work out or groom himself much. A typical guy that look like he spend alot of time indoors.
The girl? Typical nerdy girl. Golden specs, ponytail. Wearing light color sleeved tee shirt and mid length shorts. Neat socks and shoes. She is not gorgeous and make-up looks minimal. No guys will give her a 2nd look.
I can see both of them with their shopping bags, from a nearby shop selling Japanese anime novelties and toys. I concluded they like watching anime and reading mangas.
The guy is explaining or discussing something to the girl. I hear it's something about some anime series. The boy got very technical, sharing the plot, the character and whatnot. He basically geeked out in his conversation. If he is talking to normal folks, everyone would be bored to death.
But the girl, she is listening intentively. I can see she is engaging and her eyes glittering. She is enjoying the conversation.
There they are, enjoying each other's company yet take breaks in between while checking out their phones. I realised this is how introverts communicate. They need their own space but also enjoy other's company, as long as their space is maintained.
They were very cute in my eyes. This also prove that anyone deserves love regardless if your looks or your hobbies. I hope their relationship continue to flourish and go further. To prove that even nerds or plain looking people can find love.

59789,105458,"I just graduated a year ago but I honestly feel like an old person. Ever since I started working full time, I gradually stopped feeling any joy in life. The daily repeated routine of waking up, going to work, coming home to sleep feels like a chore. In fact, I wake up everyday feeling exhausted regardless of how late or early I slept the previous night.
At first, I used to look forward to the weekends as I can spend time with my friends and loved ones. Now, even this feel like a weekly burden. I feel tired being around people.
And so I decided that perhaps I just needed some ""me"" time and rest during the weekends. I stopped making plans to go out with others. Instead, I started to sleep till noon and read books or play games the rest of the day. Initially this arrangement felt like a good change but I started feeling bored after a while.
Now I honestly feel happiest and most at peace when I'm asleep. Sometimes I really wish I can just bury myself under a warm and fluffy blanket, fall into deep sleep and never wake up again.
And no, don't worry I have no thoughts of killing myself. I'm terrified of heights and knives plus I still want to be a filial child and support my parents till old. I just wanted to rant and organise my thoughts a little. Thanks for hearing me out.

58965,103843,"To OP #103823 I was like you 25 years ago and truly understand what is like living paycheck to paycheck.
I gave up my poly study at year 2 and work as a teller cos I couldn’t bear my younger brothers being affected my my family situation and they couldn’t concentrate on their studies. So I chose to work to support my parents and siblings.
No one will understand how it is like when your friends need not bat an eyelid on Starbucks but you have to refund EZ-Link card to use the money to buy dinner for the family cos your payday is on the next day and will credit in midnight.
My husband (back then still boyfriend) never once say anything or complain. But he was equally poor???? staying in an one-room rented flat. We saved every single cent, dates were usually at hawkers or foodcourt. We held our wedding dinner at a Chinese restaurant and even ‘earn’ back our dinner cost with money for overseas honeymoon.
Now with 2 kids and staying comfortably in a 4-room HDB flat, combined income still below $10k, we never once feel ‘inferior’ as compared to our peers. We are ‘debt free’ as our cpf have surplus to cover the housing loan monthly. We have no car, no condo, restaurant meals seldom exceeded $80 for fam of 4 but we are contented.
Our nights are spent chasing dramas on the bed, no drinking at pubs, no cafe hopping as all these are $$$$ and $$$. Kids during their free time, play bubble guns at the corridor, Nintendo switch and mobile games. All these activities really no need much money but still keep us occupied.
Guess god ‘compensate’ my hard life by giving me a good husband albeit we are defined as ‘poor’ in today’s context. So the question you really have to ask yourself is whether u love your boyfriend and if he is the right person who you can depend on for the next 30 years. Some may have the rich boyfriend/hubby but still unhappiness over 3rd party or debt issues.
Life is short, don’t think so much if he is really good.

So today during lunch hour, this angmoh A*STAR scientist visiting NUS for the first time got schooled by our beloved canteen aunty. When it was his turn to order, he wore a smug and aristocrat expression while rubbing his chin with his fingers, before saying leisurely and pensively, ""Hmmm... So, what do you recommend?"" But canteen aunty was taking no shits at such a busy time and bellowed out, ""LAIR-KOR-MEN SIMI SAI?! MENU HERE! MANY MANY PEOPLE BEHIND YOU, KA KIN LA!""
Color drained rapidly from that poor angmoh's face who obviously did not understand the Singlish, but apparently he grasped the tone and quickly stammered, ""T...that one."" A few minutes later when he was leaving with his food, canteen aunty added, ""Here canteen ah, not Swensens. People fast come fast go chop chop bompeepee, understand? Huat ah!""

So I am unsure whether he is lying to me or telling the truth. Assuming he is telling the truth, should I break up with him? Because i feel that he is not giving me enough of his persoanal time, however if he is lying to me i will definitely break up with him.

58980,103870,"Some people would hate me for sharing this. I am a slim girl naturally well-endowed with huge boobs. For Chinese girls, those with skinny limbs, small hips and flat stomach usually have flat or small chests. To give you some perspective, it is a 36C. And I am only 162cm and 48kg.
I'll be honest... I do enjoy the attention. Sometimes, I wear push-ups and straighten my back to make my assets more obvious. Other times, I don't even wear a bra, and even though it doesn't look as big, the nips are visible. I am proud of it, and I like to low-key show off, though I never say it out loud. Sometimes, I even unbutton the top 2 buttons of my shirt or angle my posture such that people can get a sneak peek of my bare breasts through an opening in my shirt. I know this sounds really perverted and twisted af, but I think I might be an exhibitionist. I hope you don't judge me.
I know that many girls are jealous and many guys fantasize about me - and I have caught many staring, including teachers and dads of my friends. It gives me a devilish kind of happiness when I hear that my boobs are the talk of the town. I'm sorry if you feel like telling me off at this point. But this is me.
But recently, for the first time in 24 years, I felt sad after wondering if having huge boobs is the only thing that I will ever be known for. And I feel empty.
What happened was this: I just broke up with my ex-bf over text for personal reasons, and he was really upset. I understand why he was angry, but I could not have anticipated the stuffs that happened later. Out of spite, he revealed that the only thing he wanted in the relationship was to get access to my boobs and describe them to his guy friends. Nothing about my ""bitch character"" attracted him, it was only about the sex. He even told me that his guy friends had all seen my nudes that he took, and I was just a conquest for him to show off his exploits. Wtf right. What an asshole. To verify, I asked a mutual friend who was in that gang, and he admitted after me probing for some time that he showed them those private photos on his phone but never sent them electronically. I had never felt more offended and insulted in my life. I remember I was so angry that I was screaming my head off in my room and throwing and breaking things, and my sister almost wanted to tie me up. I let this douchebag take my virginity, use me to fulfil all his deviant fantasies and I had only ever given myself to him and nobody else in my entire freaking life! And he just bloody treated it like it meant nothing to him! I was so furious that I even entertained the idea of hooking up with his brother or his boss, who is a friend of mine, just to get back at him. I actually sent out a video message saying ""Hey, want to hook up I really want this"", but recalled it shortly after thank goodness for Telegram's recall function. Eventually, common sense got the better of me and I didn't end up doing anything rash. Now, I still feel angry enough to feel shortness of breath every time I think about this, but at least I am rational enough not to do something I'll regret.
Now that I am here, I want to ask. How do I filter out the guys who are only after my boobs? How can I give people the impression that I am more than just my body parts? I can't be wearing oversized tees all the time, and I love my girly wardrobe. Also, I am a young woman, and I still want to flaunt it a little and feel sexy. In a way, I do have to show off cos I sometimes get paid to advertise stuffs on my public IG and TikTok account. Is there a way to find a balance? If yes, how to achieve it?

57879,101745,"I am married twice and I have learnt so much about maintaining a marriage from a woman's POV.
1st marriage, I was young and over zealous about being a good wife and living a good marriage. We were a horrible match, but I believed I could make it work. There was always a need to prove to everyone that I made the right choice.
I did everything that social media would deem as the perfect woman - including cook, clean, work, bring home money, plan, love his family, do home improvement projects, romance the husband, keep up with the s** and whatever you can think of. Eventually I got burnt out and he took me for granted. Can I blame him? Yes but I am also to blame because I made him into who he is.
He hated my guts because I was so good. He criticised me because he hated the compliments I got. He hated it when I see his friends because I stole his limelight. He didn't need to do anything because his wife could do everything. In my POV, I was just trying to be the best for him but in his POV, I was putting him down in every way. So like most marriage tragedies, he cheated on me with a woman who was so ordinary, so ordinary that it opened my eyes completely. I had been working blindly to become what I thought is a good woman - but was it for him? Or was it just for my own ego? I went through a phase of blaming and hating on him because I was self righteous about being the best - and yet I was hurt so badly. But now I am thankful because that failed marriage has taught me so much.
My current marriage made me realise that if you meet the right person, you don't even need to try so hard or work so hard. We know each other's strengths and we give each other space. Of course we have days when we are just pissed at each other but we choose our battles. I have the brains and he has the muscles so I do most of family and kids planning while he does the physical labor like cleaning and fixing. He will play his games and watch his sports but still be responsible for the chores at home. I go out partying with my girlfriends but still return home to be a good partner the next day. We respect each other's activities and hobbies. We are always verbal about our appreciation for one another. It is harmonious and great for the kids because I see them growing up being good people.
The biggest lesson I learnt is that - if you have issues with a man before marriage, don't marry him, wait for the one who makes you feel good about yourself and brings out the best of you. The right man will not hurt you and will appreciate you for what you have. It will hurt him to hurt you. You don't have to try to make things work, it will just work. When you realise you are trying too hard, something is very wrong!

59254,104428,"I served as an officer in the army. Can I use it to negotiate for higher salary in my first job?
I applied to this job in a manufacturing firm and my job role is more business related. After clearing the interviews, they told me they are keen to hire me and I am keen to join them too. They will be discussing salary and HR matters in a few days time. After gathering some info, this company pays additional increments for NS experience although it is not civil service or defence/ military related. I want to use my officer background to ask for higher pay. The reasons I can think of are
1. Only a minority and better performing NSFs gets selected to OCS. Being able to complete officer training demonstrates resilience and commitment.
2. As an officer, I learned leadership skills, organizational skills, management skills, planning skills etc which can also be applied in corporate world.
3. An officer held bigger responsibilities than the average soldier.
4. An officer is generally fitter than the average guy.
Are these reasons strong enough to ask for a higher salary? If not, what else should I do?

58536,103052,"Marriage is just a piece of paper or is it not?
I met this guy. He was perfect. He checked all the boxes of being an eligible bachelor. It was love at first sight for the both of us. We met each other at a friend's party and got together soon after.
A few months into the relationship we started to talk about us. He felt he is not marriage or kids material but he loves me a lot and can see a future with me. He was very clear about this and wanted me to understand before we continue. At that time he also suggested that we get a place together. Eventually he ended up getting a place on his own and I moved in with him. He told me I need not pay anything but I contributed by paying some of the bills and minor house expenses. I felt I was very much in love with him that a part of me believe I can forsake marriage as long as we are happy together. Besides I dislike children myself.
We are not married but we lived like a married couple. We cook for each other, did chores, managed the bills, visited each other's parents and we did everything together. I thought we had the perfect life. We lived like we are married and yet we have the time to date each other. I was envied by friends who witnessed our love. He still buys me flowers and gifts on special days like anniversaries, after being together for 10 years.
The final few months of our relationship I sensed his increasing distance. I convinced myself we are just busy with work and other things. He was out more, he stopped telling me about his day. It got to a point I felt we were like roommates living under the same roof. Then he told me he met someone. He needed me to move out because the other woman wants to move in.
I haven't had time to compose myself and react to this utter betrayal and I had to pack up. 10 years meant nothing to him?.. I moved back to my parents and lied to them that his place is under construction.
I haven't even had time to process my anger and grief then I heard he had a vehicle accident. His parents wasn't aware that we broke up so I was called first. I found out he was severely injured that his life won't be the same forever. The other woman didn't hesitate to dump him after seeing his condition.
Since his parents didn't know we had broken up, I choose to pretend I'm still his gf and stayed with him at the hospital. I took over most of the caregivers job because he was so helpless. I stayed over at his place often and took care of him for a while. He couldn't carry on with his current job anymore so he had to settle for a simpler job which pays lesser. The lucky thing is he had almost paid off the house so he didn't need to downgrade.
He had been needy towards me since the accident. I can understand that. How can I not feel for him? We did have a lot of happy times till this happened. I continued being there for him as he needed a lot of help and support. One day he asked me if I wanted to get married. I realised this was what I wanted all along. But not like this. I said no and realised it is time to leave him. I didn't want to take care of him anymore. So I left.
Now, I'm already past the age of having kids safely. I did try to move on. I tried to date but without much success. I met 2 who were quite persistent in chasing me. But none interest me or can even compare to him. I've got my own place during the time I was taking care of him. I think a part of me already know I won't get back together with him. I just needed a push to move on with my own life. Did I regret not getting married when I was younger? Definitely. I may have lived a very different life if I walked away the moment he told me he is not marriage material. If he cheated while we are married maybe he wouldn't have got hurt because I may not have moved out so easily.
Without a marriage certificate, it's very easy to walk away when things happen. So what kind of a person did I wanted to be? One who walks away or one who stays because of a piece of paper?

59036,104015,"This is my mid-career switch experience from teaching to software engineering. If you are thinking of doing the same, I hope my post would help you in some ways. Long story ahead.
I graduated from NIE with a bachelor in arts degree and was bonded to MOE for four years. During my four years of teaching, I gave my all and was performing above average. However, I always knew I wanted to try something else besides teaching. At that time, I didn't know what the alternative was but I just couldn't see myself in teaching for the rest of my life. Towards the end of my four years bond, I wrote my resume and applied to various job adverts on LinkedIn. I was lucky as one of the companies replied me. While I didn't have the necessary skills they needed, I promoted myself as someone willing to learn and keened to work for the company. I was prepared to take a pay cut as I knew I was starting from scratch again. I settled for a 40% pay cut for this new job.
Unfortunately, things didn't work out well for me as I found the job to be rather mundane. I knew I wouldn't get anywhere with the skills from this job and decided to cut loss by ending my employment with the company at the end of my probation period.
The good thing that came out of this was I realized I wanted to work in an environment where there would be minimal face-to-face interaction and it should be stimulating enough for me. During that period, SkillsFuture was encouraging people to join the IT industry and they were promoting this professional conversion programme for mid-career switchers to train them in IT programming. I decided to go for it. At the same time, I made use of my $500 skillsfuture credit to purchase programming courses on Udemy and continued with my learning at home.
To be honest, the courses provided by the training institute were insufficient. I was expected to learn OOP, MVC programming in 5 days, which was just impossible for someone like me without any programming background. But I was determined to figure it out. So when I was not in class, I would be following my Udemy instructor and learning on my own. The entire conversion programme took around 6 months. I updated my resume with a few mini projects I did and began my job search process. In total, I applied to close to 100 job applications and only heard back from 4 of them. I still remember the agony I went through to this day. You must understand teachers have it easy when it comes to getting a job. Our jobs were handed to us even before we graduated. We didn't have to go through this excruciating job searching process and I was jobless for more than half a year. All the self-doubt, anxiousness and negative thoughts were just eating me up every night. While waiting to hear back from the companies, I practised my interviewing skills, did leetcode, continued with my Udemy courses and prayed. I also gave part-time tuition during this period to help with my daily expenses.
After being unemployed for more than 7 months, my breakthrough came. My friend referred me to their company's HR internally. I was given an opportunity to do an online technical test which I passed and was subsequently interviewed by the project manager and MD. What helped was the mini projects I did and knowing the basics of OOP. They extended an offer to me and this ended my 8 months drought. I was drawing a fresh grad pay. It was 20% higher than my last drawn pay. While it was still lower than what I was last drawing in teaching, the opportunity to work and learn in this industry was more important than the salary. I knew I had to be humble and learn from my colleagues who were all younger than me.
The learning curve was steep but I enjoyed every part of it. I'm coming to 3 years in this industry and in these 3 years, I attained two cloud solutions architect associate certifications and was promoted to a senior position. I burnt many nights and weekends away studying and upskilling myself in new technologies.
Looking back, leaving teaching was a leap of faith. With a degree in arts and four years of work experience only in teaching, it was really difficult to find something comparable in the commercial sector. To those who are thinking of leaving teaching or even joining the IT industry, I would advise that you try out those programming courses on Udemy first during after office hours and weekends. It'll minimally take you 3 months to figure out what you are doing. But you must persevere. Rewatch the videos until you get it. Figure out if this is for you. Most of the udemy courses will teach you by building projects. Make changes to those projects and customize them so that you can show them in your resume. If you plan to go for the diplomas or certifications provided by higher-level institutes, make sure you have enough savings to do so. Even if you don't plan to, you should also make sure you have enough savings for your expenses in case you need to settle for a pay cut. Those in teaching, at least leave after you've collected your 4 years connect plan.
I got headhunted by another company during this recent tech hiring spree with a happy increment. I'm now drawing a salary higher than what I would be getting if I were to stay in teaching. Most importantly, I'm doing something I can see myself doing till my retirement. Was it scary? You bet. But I grew so much in these three years when I chose to leave my comfort zone and I'm glad I made that decision 4 years ago. Oh, and not to forget the benefits of working from home.
To those who choose to stay in teaching, I have nothing but admiration for all of you. The working hours are tough and there is no such thing as work-life balance. You are a teacher to your students 24/7. Thank you! To those who need a way out, maybe this could be an option for you to consider. All the best!

58963,103838,"I am the author of https://www.facebook.com/695707917166339/posts/7449352511801812/. I honestly did not expect the post to blow up as I'm afraid that my story would come across as your typical story about SG men getting con by Thai women.
However, like many have predicted, there is indeed more to the story as Moon's dubious behavior marks the start of unraveling her true identity.
Her repeated plea for cash sparked my curiosity about her family. When probed further, she would brush me off and assured me that they are doing fine thanks to me. She would often use suggestive language as a form of diversion. Succumbed to lust, I fell into her trap leaving my suspicion lingering.
The truth is that the sex was so good that it left a strong impression on me. The crescent moon tattooed on her left arm turns me on every time we meet. We made love in various places ranging from high-end hotels like MBS to public areas like changing rooms. As soon as we set foot on our destination, we began undressing and demonstrating our affection for each other. Before we knew it, we were lying next to each other panting and exhausted. Every session ends with her whispering something to my ears to get me aroused for our next meetup. Words cannot describe how amazing the experience was.
However, good times do not last forever, and Moon was no exception. She started replying less, using busy as an excuse to avoid my calls. It eventually came to a point where I got completely ignored, driving me anxious.
I headed back to the Thai disco in search of an answer. After speaking with the manager, I came to discover that she is on a short-term visa. It was added that her recent attempt to extend her stay was denied and she is unlikely to return anytime soon. I was devastated.
Just when I thought I had lost all hope of seeing Moon again, the manager suggested trying my luck with Facebook. As they were mutual friends, he shared her FB profile with me and I began browsing through her posts.
Her public gallery revealed multiple photos of a young chap in his everyday life. What drew my attention was a tattoo that was identical to Moon on the exact same spot. It had me thinking that perhaps this person is a close contact of hers, possibly her sibling, child or even husband.
I took my questions to the manager for clarification. I got a rude shock. The person in the photo was, in fact, Moon before her gender reassignment. She used to be a male back then.
Embarrassed and frustrated, I cooped up in my room for several weeks refusing to see anyone. I questioned my sanity on whether our exchange was an outright lie from the beginning. Was all of this a scheme to con my money? I guess I will never know as she remained unreachable till today. Neither do I intend to investigate further as it will only adds to the disappointment. Things ended unanimously between us leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.
Apologize if my encounter did not turn out to be as dramatic as what many perceived to be. The intention is not to seek advice but to share about my past. I was originally hesitant to continue but was encouraged by the community. The overwhelming response is what drives confessors like me to continue posting. I hope u guys had fun listening to my story and I'll catch everyone in my next confession. Till next time.
