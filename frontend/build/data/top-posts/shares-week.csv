61118,108225,"I need to confess...
I met my wife 5 years back ago, when we were about to graduate. The first time I saw her, I told to myself ""She's the girl I want to marry. She's the girl I want by my side. She's the girl I want to protect."" But she was taken at that time.
A part of me felt so lost and wanted her so badly. A part of me felt I shouldn't disturb her and I should move on. I couldn't. So I stalked all her social media, be friends with her friends and got introduced as a ""mutual friend"". When we officially met for the first time, things were already not looking good between she and her boyfriend at the time. I took my chance to fill his spot and constantly gave her my support, my love. And eventually, she fell in love with as well. She decided to break it off with her then-boyfriend, although she didn't know I knew everything about her prior beforehand thus I was able to be the perfect listener for her. 
As we got together and with marriage coming into my mind but she was still not ready, I did a bold decision. I babytrapped her on purpose as I thought, ""with our kid, she will be with me forever. She will never leave me and she HAS TO marry me"". In the end she was furious when she got pregnant, but quickly let go of the issue as she thought we are both responsible. 
Flashback to now looking at our 3 years old daughter and her, she's still the same girl I want to take care for the rest of my life. Although we are financially stable and have a happy family right now while even waiting for our BTO, I feel so extremely guilty. I felt she will hate me, if she knew what really happened. I know I will probably take this secret to my grave, although I will have to carry this guilt for the rest of my life.
I'm sorry, but I love you too much. I know I was selfish, but I will spend the rest of my life making up to you.

61114,108220,"I have been in a relationship with a crazy girl for the past 6 years. We both met when studying at NUS. We started out as FWB before she proposed to be my gf. I recently chanced upon her boasting in secret chats that I was the best she ever had and sharing how she felt that I was out of her league. To date, the best thing in our relationship is still the sex, and that is pretty much the only thing keeping the relationship going. 
Sometimes I feel like a garbage collector because of the crazy things she does and the problems I have to deal with when she goes crazy. Just yesterday she called the police on me because I refused to have sex with her the previous night. And if you ever see a girl crying, screaming and shouting in public, that's probably her... This happens 99% of the time when I do not have sex with her the previous night or the very morning. So Im forced to spend hours every day having sex with her. Has anyone dated a girl like this or is also stuck in the same predicament?!

61112,108227,"The food my wife prepares is absolutely horrendous. Even though we can afford spending money to order in, she insists on cooking because she enjoys it. As a result I have to force myself to eat it. Despite feedback from myself and the kids, no improvements were made. 
When I complain about it, she says ""People do things for you still complain! One day I stop then you know ah!""
Is this a valid reason to continue doing things poorly? Actually, I'd very much like her to stop lol. I'd gladly ""know ah"".

61115,108221,"I’ve opened a Pandora’s box…
Just want to vent this out here and hear your thoughts.
I met this guy through dating app. We clicked and he got me pregnant after years of being in an r/s. We also got married. 
Currently I am still in my maternity leave. I am staying at home most of the time and taking care of the baby. One night, I was just feeling nostalgic how we started from dating app to this and I decided to backread our first conversation in his WS. I used his because I accidentally uninstalled my WS app earlier this year and I failed to have a backup of our conversation thread. I typed “hotel” in the search thread cos as consenting adults, we went to hotel when we were just starting and I wanna read how we progress from there, getting into relationship and marrying each other. 
But as I was scrolling to the year when we first met, I saw some conversation with “hotels” too and how they had sex, etc. I was flabbergasted and I don’t know how to react. 
In summary, this is the timeline. We first met on *insert date*. One week later, he had sex with this other woman he met in the app. One week later, we met again and kissed. Four days later, he had sex again with that woman. Two days later, he met with me in the hotel but we didn’t have sex that time though we made out. It was only two weeks later after we decided to be exclusive to each other but not officially tgt yet.
I didn’t know any of his sexual escapades until now. Not that his body count matters to me cos to be fair, we weren’t in a relationship that time so technically he was still single. But what bothers me is that what if we were having sex that time when he was hooking up with that woman? I think I couldn’t take it… 
Moving forward, I lowkey asked him if he had any ons/ fubu/fwb before meeting me and he said no. I was just appalled how he could lie to me, or maybe he just really doesn’t want me to know that part of his past.. 
I felt that I have opened a Pandora’s box and tbh I still love him the same. He has been a wonderful husband and father. I am aware that those are things from the past and what matters is the present and the future. Though, I felt relieved that I didn’t have sex with him that time that he was shagging other woman. Also, he also has been faithful to me eversince we decided to become exclusive until we officially dating. I am just feeling betrayed on how he lied to me. Because I would appreciate his honesty— that’ll only imply that he trusts me with his deepest and darkest secrets, but unfortunately he didn’t…

61113,108218,"the dating world and the employment world are the same.
for guys out there who are looking for a hot girl, then you have to spend.
from our perspective, our youth are limited, why not optimise the youth 
go on vacations, eat great food, receive gifts
in addition we also look at the prospective-in-laws
will the guy be able to buy a nice condo, own nice car
will the parents be able to help?
once again, it is not us being materialistic but the nature of life
we will need to protect our short term and long term interest
looks, wealth or the potential for wealth, personality
you need to have minimally 2. 
even when you go for a job interview, you look at the starting pay and the potential for increment
some guys claim true devotion. true devotion doesnt work that way.
when a younger newer girl comes, your true devotion will vanish into thin air  
hence, true devotion has no value. we need something tangible
even in the unfortunate event of divorce we can get half of the matrional assets
TLDR: you have to be realistic. if you are average, settle for a even slighty more average girl. someone who is willing to bto a 3 room hdb with you. but even then 10 years down the road, the girl will start to complain and compare you to her friends' husband, like you complain your employer isnt paying you enough

61119,108228,"Hi, I would like some advice on what I should do - leave or stay?
To give some context, I’m currently dating a guy for about 5 months. However, he is unsure if he wants to continue and be official as he felt that a part of him still love his ex and he still thinks of her everyday.
There are a few things that I’m concerned about that makes me feel like I should leave 
- How we first started: he didn’t tell me that he has a gf then and we went out quite a few times (I later found out that he didn’t let his gf know too) - feels like he might cheat?
- How we first had s**: I told him I was not ready to do it and he said we will just kiss but he still ended up doing it and told me it doesn’t feel good that I resist 
- How we first decide to date: he was pestering me to go on a date with him and even tried to do this in office that makes me uncomfortable
- How he make me feel: I feel that he makes me feel sad almost everyday - I think the number of times I feel sad this year prob exceed the number of times I feel sad my entire life
Some reasons why I still stay:
- he provides some form of financial support (pays for most of my stuff)
- He told me that it would be weird if I date other ppl and they found out that I have done it before even though I never had a bf - so it is better for me to stay with him 
- We booked a trip for Jan 24 (it’s a secret from the whole world anyway)
- Whenever I decide to leave, it feels that there are always unexpected things to make me stay  (eg I got pregnant but we did the abortion alr)
- He tries to be nicer at least he is nicer than before
I have been seeing a counsellor after that incident and honestly, I know there are much better people out there but I’m not too sure why I find it so hard to leave.
Perhaps, it is due to the pregnancy that I was in my own world, the only person I talked to was him as I didn’t wanted to share this with anybody in my life.
I was thinking if we were ever to get together or married, I won’t want to introduce him to any of my family and friends because I’m not proud of him at all. So I know that there will be no future of any sorts even if he choose to stay.
So what should I do? I feel that leaving is the best choice but staying status quo for a while more is also fine. How do I make sure I do leave and get over it if I choose to leave?

61123,,"Have there been cases where private hospitals were able to treat someone when public hospitals were not able to?
I have a family member who has a tumor in an area where it is very complicated to remove and the TTSH doctor is saying the chances of surgery success and survival is low.
My family is planning to seek a second opinion from other hospitals, including private ones.
- I'm wondering has anyone encountered cases where the second opinion was entirely different in a good way?
- I'm not well-informed about the differences in public vs private hospital treatment, but have there been cases where private hospitals were able to treat someone when public hospitals were not able to?
My family is feeling pretty hopeless and depressed now and we're going to grab onto any hope we can get our hands on.

61121,108230,"Dear admin, please grant me permission as I'm keen to gather diverse perspectives on this matter.
Greetings to all, I am a fresh graduate nurse and i’m pretty shocked at how low the pay is for dip/degree nurses. Many of my peers start with a salary of $3350 without honors; with merit, it rises to $3.4k-$3.6k. Honors students can earn around $4k, while diploma holders begin at approximately $2.5k. After CPF deductions, the take-home pay for degree holders without honours might be just above 2k.
 I'm unsure why the government is actively encouraging locals to join the nursing workforce when, based on last year's employment survey, the pay remains among the lowest in the university. 
Given the demanding nature of nursing, coupled with the aging population, one might argue that the starting pay should be significantly higher to retain local nurses.
The government has sought assistance from other countries, including India and the Philippines, to address the nursing manpower shortage but we all know they would leave after their 6 years bond & employing foreigners are just short term solutions. 
During COVID, 20% of Philippine nurses left Singapore, and it's widely known that foreigners often view Singapore as a stepping stone to later work in Australia. Unfortunately, nursing lacks appeal among locals due to low pay and persistent discrimination and stereotypes, with the profession still being labeled a ""dirty job"" and I feel that there’s no way we can change the mindset of the generation nowadays as it has been fixated like this for so many years..
