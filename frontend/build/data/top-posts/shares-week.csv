60654,107238,"Hi Prof Ben, I am interested in pursuing a career in the field of robotics R&D, but I have some reservations regarding its current state of hype.
1) Undoubtedly, the adoption of robotics is inevitable as the economic feasibility and alignment of the technology are well-established. Nevertheless, my reservations center around the pursuit of deep tech R&D in Singapore, particularly in robotics. The existence of numerous R&D positions in MNCs seems somewhat contrived, as they would not exist without government funding. Furthermore, many R&D corporate labs are conducting research on topics that are not closely aligned with their core business, which raises concerns about the artificiality of the situation.
2) Given Singapore's tendency to prioritize proven technologies rather than being an early adopter of cutting-edge advancements, I am hesitant to fully invest myself in deep tech. The fear of a sudden cessation of funding for robotics R&D, akin to what occurred in the autonomous driving industry in 2017 or the pharmaceuticals R&D industry a few years prior, makes me hesitant about going on the path of deep tech
Joining deep tech requires significant investment to excel in this field, such as spending years and large sums of money obtaining a postgraduate degree, and committing non-transferable specialized skills to this niche which might make pivoting to other fields hard.
I like robotics, but I'm hesitant to enter a potentially artificially inflated industry that may lose government funding and support if outcomes and results fail to meet expectations.
I'm genuinely curious to see what is your opinion on this, or if I'm overthinking

60657,107245,"Does anyone else feel that the term ""mommy's boy"" is being overly used as a cover for toxic feminism?
I don't deny that there are really some guys that are overly focused on their parents, and I'm not referring to them. However, lately, it seems that any time a guy has any sort of consideration for their mother at all, it gets called out for being a mommy's boy, and it's a ""red flag"" worthy of being dumped right away.
It's funny how it is totally fine for women to want, and even have expectations to their partners, to be filial to their own parents. Everything men do must take her parents into consideration, at times even having to provide for them, yet having any consideration for the mens' parents at all seem to make him the worst person in the universe.
It seems to point more towards a certain amount of self-centredness where women must be the the centre of the universe in a relationship and everything should revolve around their whims and fancy, whereas the man purely exists to serve her and must drop all his other familial responsibilities while upholding hers.

60656,107244,"A good friend of mine is studying in Australia as a physio, hard working dude with a clear goal in mind. He used to have a local gf (let's call her W), together in a LDR who he promised that he will return and ask for her hand once he is done with his studies and financially stable. However, he was met with some setbacks, extended his studies. Few years down the road, a female friend of W (let's call her MO) who was cheated on by her then bf, began putting thoughts into W's head that guys studying overseas always cheat on their girlfriends in Sg blah blah blah, and why should W waste time on my poor friend when there are so many other guys in Sg with money and career etc that can satisfy her needs. In the end, W cheated on him by going on Tinder, meeting guys on the pretext that she is looking for friends but actually, options. In the end she settled for one engineering guy, very shortly after BTOed and recently got married, posting everything on social media, while my poor friend in Australia was left heartbroken on his own during COVID lockdown period back then away from everything, helpless. Just because of such toxicity, one poor chap had his relationship ended while he is working towards his dream.
I am going on an exchange soon, and I'm really worried, what if someone toxic and blonde like MO, decides to plant thoughts into my girlfriend, and I experience the same outcome. What should I do? I have a good and healthy relationship with my gf, just like my friend and W back then, but things well down south really quickly for them. How can I put it to my gf, that such a topic actually do bothered me? Advices please.

60662,107260,"I have a friend of sorts whom I have known for a long time. I find that she is sometimes quite selfish in the way she treats others, and she is almost definitely a narcissist. However, we share similar hobbies and she can be very fun to hang out with, so I've stuck around.
About half a year ago, she decided to get a rabbit on impulse. I was surprised as she never really showed a great deal of interest in animals, but then again she is fickle and prone to having such ""phases"". It was the cutest little thing ever, all fluff and giant ears with a little waggling bobtail. I played with it only a couple times when I visited, but I loved the little bunny to bits.
Last week, I met her for coffee and I asked her how her rabbit was doing. She casually mentioned that it had died some time ago without even batting an eyelid. Mortified, I asked what had happened and she said that she had been leaving the bunny out on her bare concrete balcony most days as she didn't like having fur all over the house, and one evening she came home and it was ""just laying there dead"". The poor wretched thing had literally been baked to death in the scorching 35 degree heat!
As distressing as the news was, what I found the most disturbing was her complete lack of guilt -or any kind of emotion at all- that she had basically murdered a helpless living thing out of willful negligence. She brushed right over the subject like it was just some idle gossip, leaving me utterly speechless.
I feel like I can no longer associate myself with someone with such sociopathic tendencies and I have been avoiding her since that day. I also can't help but think of how much the rabbit must have suffered before it died. I even considered reporting her anonymously to the SPCA for animal cruelty, but it's too late for that. RIP little sweet angel.. I hope you're in bunny heaven now, wherever that may be.

60660,107255,"How to prevent rumours?
Long story short, I have already started working but will be going back to school for postgrad. To my surprise, my ex gf's friend will be my new classmate. According to my ex gf herself, her friend is one of the biggest gossip mongers around. I actually broke up with my ex gf because I could not stand her toxicity but I've heard from mutual friends that my ex gf has been going around telling people that she ""dumped"" me because ""I am a bad person"". I was surprised because I did not expect her to make such things up. I also heard that this future classmate has been going around telling people in our friend circle this false thing from my ex gf too. I do not want this to affect my future social life and reputation in a postgrad program which has not even started yet. What to do?

60655,107240,"Differences in political views and understanding makes it impossible for a relationship? I have been texting a guy from China (we got know each other by chance; we would see each other around but never talked and recently he talked to me and asked to hang out sometimes as he doesn't know many people). Due to cultural differences and also my poor command of chinese, just asking the folks here, was he asking me out?
Recently we kind of touched on the subject of certain areas in China and there was a clash in opinions (mainly because of the different media that we are exposed to; he only accesses chinese media while I only access western-centred media). I think he was kind of unhappy and we kind of stopped texting. I am also not sure if he is interested in me or just trying to make friends. If he is interested in being more than friends, would this ever work out? I think language barriers, cultural differences can be worked through, but what about political differences? In this case where one party has and will only consider one media outlet as a source of information. Should I just give up? Students from China, or anyone who has dated someone from China, please weigh in! One thing to note is that he is about (30+ 40) and not good in English. Thanks!
