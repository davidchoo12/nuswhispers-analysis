Me: 22F, active lifestyle, all sorts of hobbies ranging from trading card games to martial arts, lowkey chatterbox, honours year NUS student.
My standards: decent shape, has hobbies and interests he is able to talk about, and is in a position that I'm not likely to be the main breadwinner in the long run. idgaf if he's a poly grad with a side hustle, another student in my faculty, a fresh grad with fresh grad pay, whatever. Have something going on.
I am very very lucky if I can find someone who even hits 2 of those. Went on so many blind dates. One of the better dates was another TCG nerd who I could talk with all night, but wasn't physically attractive for me - alamak, what to do, close two eyes also cannot.
Then got the prettyboys who have interests but cannot talk.
Then got those who cannot present themselves well, but can talk... however, it is only about work.
Then finally got the legend that looked 46 years old at 26, insulted the disabled waiters - in one of those 'manned only by the disabled' cafés - within 5 minutes of sitting down, insulted me within 20 minutes of that, and blamed immigrants for him (poly dropout with no interest in upskilling, no side hustles, and clearly no ability to remove his foot from his mouth) earning $2k/month. WTAF?
Alamak. Men, take comfort that no matter how bad you think you might be, you're probably not stupid enough to insult the disabled waiters during a blind date.
I'm sure most SGean men are not like this, but the sheer amount of nonsense I have to filter through makes me want to give up and start looking into adopting a few cats. I'll be the crazy cat lady with a bottle of wine and a sick card collection that is singlehandedly paying a game store's rent, idgaf.

60603,107106,"I have been reading stories about toxic parents, and parents who demand too much allowance. So I'm here to share my story. Just want to get this out of my chest.
Mother was divorced shortly after I was born. She then cohabited with a gambler who frequently molested my elder sister and me. We told her a few times that we were being molested, but the most she did was to tell the gambler that he must be careful in the way he touched us so that we won't call it molest. Had to live in fear everyday for more than 10 years until they spilt. Then she got together with another guy and they got married, so legally he is my stepfather. But I am totally not close to him.
My relationship with my mother wasn't good to begin with. Since young, I blamed her for not protecting me when I was molested for so many times. She was also very biased. She treated my sister much better than me. My elder sister always had new clothes and toys whereas I could only have hand-me-downs. I had to put up with her daily insults and she laid her hands on me even when I was in JC. She never scolded my sister before, no matter what my sister did. I had to do housework while my sister could slack at home the whole day. I could go on and on about the disparity in treatment.
Her attitude towards me slightly improved when I entered the workforce because I started to give her allowance. At first, I thought that I can finally have a loving mother and experience some family warmth. But I was wrong. After I got married and had kids, I told her that I could not give her as much allowance as before. Her attitude changed immediately. When I brought my kids over to visit her, she liked to criticise them just like how she insulted me when I was young. She has never bought any gifts for my kids. I dreaded bringing my kids over to her place because the vibe was always so negative and my kids were puzzled why their grandmother hated them so much. Then one day we had a big argument over money (she obviously wanted more money from me) and I decided that enough is enough. She is just seeing me as a money tree. Given how badly she treated me when I was young and how nasty she was to my kids, I felt that she does not deserve to receive another cent from me and I want to protect my kids from their toxic grandmother. So I cut off all contact with her.
In case you all are wondering whether she is acting this way because she didn't have enough allowance, I can tell you no. She has stopped working for the past 20 years and her monthly allowance from my stepfather, my sister and me was $3000. She is just a housewife who cooks dinner 3 times a week, spends most of her time sleeping at home (or flirting with other men outside, behind my stepfather's back). Yet she is getting $3000, more than the hawker centre cleaners who toil their back from morning till night. And she had the audacity to ask more money from me? It didn't occur to her that she had been mentally and physically abusing me since I was young?
It was that big argument that made me realised that I really hated her to the core all these years. After I cut off contact with her, I dreamt of her occasionally (I never dreamt of her before). And in all my dreams, I was venting my anger on her. I was scolding her all the things I wanted to say to her face in real life. I even slapped her in my dreams. I would wake up feeling angry because the dreams felt so realistic, but also quite satisfied that I 'got my revenge'.
I do feel that I am in a better place now. I don't need such a toxic mother to ruin my life and my kids' lives. I can have my own loving family, with me modeling what a good parent is to my kids.

I think I'm a 2/10 woman or maybe a 1/10. Simply based on how I look. It doesn't matter how much I earn. By the way I earn around 6k and I'm already in my late 30s. I get passover for promotions because I don't look like a leader or I'm not pretty enough to be in meetings with the others. I notice the high fliers usually are the better looking ones and they are very engaging when they speak with others. I know I have none of that charisma. This is my first and only job since graduation. I know I have no drive and I am content to not work my way up.
I have already planned to stay with my parents and take care of them until they pass on so that's where my money is going should I pass on earlier than them.
All the men in my social circle have friendzoned me a long time ago. I have already resigned to the fact in this lifetime I will be attending everyone's wedding but my own. I will be buying baby gifts for everyone else's baby other than my own. I know my looks are way below average. So I never bothered with make up. I just made sure I'm neat, tidy and presentable for work.
I don't put myself out there so there is zero risk in being rejected. I've also started to only hang out with friends who are also single like me because I am tired of the pitiful looks other couples give me. I also know no one will ever have anyone in mind to introduce to me.
I do feel miserable sometimes. But I know no man will ever want to date me or even get to know me romantically. There's always another prettier girl. If there's a group photo of girls, I'll always be the ugliest one. The one that everyone don't remember seeing in the picture.
I do have other hobbies. I watch k drama. I like BTS. I play online games. I read books. Most of the time, I live in solitude.
Without knowing my looks, would any man dare to give me a chance? No.
There's always someone worse off than you.

Why her parents dont like you got 3 main reasons
1) not rich enough/poorly educated
2) impolite to them
3) different colour/beliefs
The key to all 3 is be humble, send lots of gifts, apologise/kneel at door if needed, and continue to send gifts, display sincerity, convert if necessary, basically wear down their suspicions with your patience.
Eventually you will get her but whether you will be happy long term is another story

60591,107084,"Contrary to what other young people think, I feel it's fine to give allowance and help with house chores at home as much as possible. Hear me out.
My family is a typical Asian household. Mum left workforce early to take care of us at home. Only Dad works. To me it's logical to support Mum and sometimes Dad because of what they did for us since young. Especially Mum, but sometimes, have to act a bit filial piety. Up the allowance by 10 or 20, even 50 sometimes to show you care. Act a bit. Then in the future if you need to reduce, they won't have much to say, and remember to let them know you up their allowances. Do alrdy need to show. Cos you filial piety before, or did even more, so when it's time to reduce filial piety, they will understand.
Next, housework. Since young, Mum has been the one doing it. Now it's my turn. I do it for a few reasons. First being I don't want to incur medical costs when they injure themselves. Wipe the ceiling fan? Come I do. Mop floor, I do. Wash toilet I do. I'm still young I do. The chances of me injuring myself is way lower than when they do them. When you do for them, you are helping yourself too. Second being you can train to do things yourself to prepare yourself when it's time to live alone. Learn progressively. This week learn mop floor. Next week learn toilet. Following week learn ironing. I know many of us still ask our mothers to iron our clothes. Some don't even know how to use washing machine. Now it's the time to learn. For parents and underneath this, really it's for yourself.
This might sound selfish, but what you are doing is actually to prepare yourself, to master the skills needed. To help yourself. So it's ok to give your parents allowance. It's fine because they might not be working, or they earn little. Show that you care. Because all these will be your arsenals in the future. Reasons to siam things. Take it as opportunity cost. Cost that you should be willing to incur for a better future.

Graduated from NUS, landed a job in an investment bank in Singapore as entry level. After working for a year, managed to seize an opportunity to do internal transfer to UK for the same job. But i am facing some discrimination from my manager , and team dynamics is not going well. I am still doing well for my own assigned things, and received positive feedback. However I am having issue with my current manager, who frequently says that she do not understand my accent. I work harder than the rest and usually overtime without extra pay to bear more responsibilities.
However, the discrimination is getting to me to the point that I want to do another internal transfer. However, i am currently stuck on 5 year contract with my current team due to visa related issues.
Can I seek your advise on whether I should consider an internal transfer, to maintain better work life balance and career progression. Or continue sticking to current team to fulfill 5 year obligations.

But, who cares right? Because I'm just a despo sci girl desperate for my cells to not die and for my experiments to work. No one would want to date me even if I'm a 8/10 because I simply don't have time.

60598,107097,"Dear Prof. Ben, I am writing to address concerns about the grading policy for the FYP in CS program, specifically only limited portion of students can receive A or A+ grades. Many of my seniors told me that only a small portion of students can get A or A+ in FYP, at least for last year's results.
The policy may not be fair for two reasons:
As undergraduate students, we are new to the research process and face numerous uncertainties while working on our FYPs. It is unrealistic to expect us to perform at the same level as graduate students with more research experience. Given the great effort we invest in learning and exploring these unfamiliar fields(for myself at least, I have spent much much more effort on my FYP comparing with 3 CS mods), we propose that more students should have the opportunity to receive A or A+ grades.
Most students undertaking FYPs already have a CAP higher than 4.5. By limiting the number of A and A+ grades, we inadvertently penalize those who work diligently and challenge themselves on their research projects, creating a really discouraging environment. Moreover, with the current grading policy, many of these high-achieving students may see their CAPs decrease, which could negatively impact their chances of being accepted into Master's or PhD programs in future.
We kindly request that you consider revisiting the FYP grading policy to give out more A and A+ grades to FYP students, which would recognize and reward the hard work and dedication of our fellow students.

Each time I wake up from these dreams, I had to remind myself that, yes, I have already graduated a long time ago, and no, there is nothing to panic about anymore.
When I talk to friends who have yet to graduate, even their stories of what they’re dealing with now induces a kind of physiological fight or flight response/stress in me.

monetary compensation wise it is not as good as lawyer or banker. but the sense of satisfaction is priceless.
we worked up to a 100 hours a week if we include call hours. yes some patients are stubborn and doesnt do lifestyle changes, but perhaps it is the technique and explanation. once you make them trust you, they will improve their lifestyle.

60597,107095,"There was this article floating around by a graduating law student in NUS: https://lawgazette.com.sg/…/the-road-to-a-more-equitable-…/…
Presumably, he is about to start his 12 months traineeship and complains about how low trainee pay is (which he would be subject to soon). Personally, I find this article ridiculous. Is 12 months of 'low' pay really that bad when afterwards, you would make like 7k5 as a law associate? Most aspiring lawyers recognise this and are willing to take that tradeoff for the great rewards later. Tell me of a major (CS aside), that pays that much for average 2nd year graduate? Even the 'low' pay is not that low at 2k5 a month, which is on par with what most poly graduates make. To complain that it is not sustainable in our society with a high cost of living is ridiculous. What about the many other non university graduates that do live off that amount a month? To me, this sounds like someone who is so entitled that he do not even want to sacrifice the initial 12 months of 'pain'. By changing mindsets, one can think of it as a 5th year as a law major and it won't seem that bad. Other prestigious course like medicine is a 5 year program and do not even pay close to 7k upon graduation.
Perhaps his contention is that 1 year of experience does not justify 3x increase in pay. Perhaps he is right. What about this? I propose increasing trainee pay and DECREASING associate's pay. Would he be agreeable to that? Perhaps now you pay trainees 4k a month but only pay associates 5.5k a month. Would people prefer that? (Mind you 5.5k is already top percentile of pay for NUS graduates). I doubt most law trainees to be would be agreeable to such an arrangement. This is a case of wanting to have your cake and eat it.
With great salary comes some sacrifices. Even despite this 12 month period, I am sure tons of top students will continue to flock to law for the great salary that is resilient despite market conditions. (Even the CS pay that people always talk about is definitely going to dip in this market conditions). Practicing lawyers always like to rant about how hard and bad work life like is, but conveniently forgot how much more they are paid compared to other NUS graduates (not to amount how it increases exponentially as they progress). ""What is the point of owning a BMW if I cant find time to ride it?"" I find this highly entitled. If you don't like the work so much, give it to someone else then. I'm pretty sure you can find many others willing to work twice as hard for that salary.

60599,107099,"Saw a cute guy doing his prematriculation checkup today at UHC, wanted to go up to him but he left by the time I was out from the Dr office...
I think he's going into med, since the staff at the counter seemed to know him and they asked about medicine intake?
Hopefully someone knows who he is or maybe I will see him again around school ;)
