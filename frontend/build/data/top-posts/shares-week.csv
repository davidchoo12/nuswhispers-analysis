61222,108480,"Hi Prof Ben, is it ok to be a CS student and not be keen in Machine Learning or Data Science?
Everyone around me seems to be gunning for related modules and seniors are all applying for jobs in those. 
My interests are closer to networking and computer graphics. But everyone tells me those areas have poor prospects. Both Infrastructure and Game Dev jobs don't pay well with long hours.
Should I just follow the crowd?

61223,108522,"Unlike some of the other posters here, I have decided  to choose a career in embedded systems. When  I first graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, I got a job in working on embedded systems for a local robotics company. But this company uses STM32 and the STM32CubeIDE abstracts away a lot of the low level details, so basically I was doing some stuff that is really similar to arduino programming which I'm sure other companies don't value that much. Added to the fact that as a mechanical engineering grad, I did not take CS courses and was stumped by some data structures and algorithms questions that other companies asked when I tried going for interviews. I would like to ask Dr Rajesh/Mr Yeo Kheng Meng for some advice. Besides knowing C and some data structures and algorithms, as well as FreeRTOS, the communication protocols (SPI, UART, I2C), what are some other skills that an embedded software engineer must know to have a future in this field? Thanks.
