60677,107434,"Hi there! I'm a 23yo female this year and I have recently started working after graduation in a pretty well paying job. Things are looking up for me and I also have a hunch that my boyfriend is going to propose soon because he has been probing me alot about ring preferences alot in the recent months. TBH he doesn't really have any red flags and has alot of green flags: he's kind, caring, family-oriented and gentlemanly. Sxx is also very good and it helps that we both have high libido. Career-wise he is also doing very well too. I genuinely do see a future with him and want to start a family with him.
HOWEVER theres just 1 thing... He is 10 years older than me and we've been dating for about 10 years as well. And if you did the math... Well yeah, I think you'd get it. It kinda was child grooming? I'll admit we starting having sex really early on into the relationship (less than a year) and we have been active throughout. We also haven't been using any protection but in his defence, it was a mutual decision.
Honestly I'm torn after doing some self-reflection.On one hand, i really love him and want to have a family. On the other I find it hard to come to peace with the past. I find it kinda messed up. I'm afraid that others will know about the past and whether it will affect my ability to be a good mother to my children. I would say yes in a heart beat if he asked me for marriage a few months ago but now I'm not sure. Please advice this troubled girl!

The most impt to be able to afford quality housing is ur salary. For pte housing, we try to aim for 8k starting pay at graduation as this will max out ur cpf oa contribution which u can pour into ur House
By 3 years into your job, your pay shld be 12k.
Don't buy a car. Please. Take mrt and bus. Adult Concession is just $128 per mth. Treat pte hire rides as a sin.
If you want a nice house early, DO NOT transfer to SA. Transferring to SA will cause issues with downpayment of 25%. Don't believe in those 1M65 idiots.
Transferring to SA is stupid coz if u can max out your cpf ceiling of 102k per year from age of 27, you will hit frs even without transferring.
You are permitted to eat avocados.Unlimited amount. I personally eat 4 daily. Quite cheap ntuc sell 4 for $6.95. And quite filling.
Keep your daily expense to less than $20 excluding avocadoes. Use sim only. Don't change phone too frequently. Cancel unnecessary Netflix Disney subscriptions. Don't give parents too much money. Under report ur income to them. Just max two credit card and pay ur credit card fully each month. Too much credit card affects the loan u can get next time. Don't buy too much new clothes, make up, accessories. Limit ur insurance spending by buying the correct things. Buy term insurance. Critical illness can opt out. But full hospitalization insurance is a must. Cancel gym. Go use the public fitness corner.
If u do the above, you shld be able to gather cash + oa of 600,000 by age 30 to 31 if girl and 32 to 33 if guy. Then u pour it into your downpayment and stamp duty for the first 2 bedroom rcr new lauch or 3 bedroom ocr new launch.
Tldr: avocado is not the problem. The problem is not earning enough and spending too much money.
