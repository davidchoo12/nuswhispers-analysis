60540,106981,"my (21m) gf (20f) just broke up with me last thursday, without saying a word. she just ghosted me, blocked me on whatsapp, telegram, and even my phone number when i tried to call her.
we had been together for 9 months. she was my very first gf, while she previously had 2 exes (recent one being 30yo), and 2 fwbs (recent one being 40yo) which came as a shock to me when i found out later, but i just chose to ignore her past.
things were going well for us the first few months, going on fun dates, texting until 4am everyday.. at that time, it really felt like she was a genuinely nice person, who was easy-going and fun to be with.
the 2 of us came from vastly different family backgrounds, with me being more well-off while her having to rent a room to live in with her divorced stepmother.
knowing this, i offered for her to move in with me in my room at my house for 3 months, as it would more conducive for her studies, which my parents agreed to.
the first few weeks of living together was fun, spending time and cuddling together everyday. i gave her all the love she needed, dry her hair, bathe her everyday, and even wash her bra and underwear together with her every week. other than these chores, i even helped her edit her assignments and reports for school.
over time, this became a norm, and she started taking these for granted, getting annoyed when i do not have the time to do those stuffs for her due to my own schoolwork piling up. i had no choice but to sacrifice some work and sleep just to do these for her. but it really felt like there was no appreciation for what i did.
as more weeks went by, more red flags started surfacing. she would complain to me when my parents cooks meal that she doesn't like, or get annoyed at me for not spending enough time with her when i have got assignments to complete, and many other small things which made me see her true self.
but even with all these, i chose to forgive and forget, hoping that she will become a better version of herself one day, hoping that this could really be a long-lasting relationship.
unfortunately, i was wrong. recently, we started to drift apart, texting less, hanging out less. despite all this, i still helped her edit her personal statements in her uni applications, hoping that i can make a difference in her future, or even OUR future.
less than a week after i finished editing her final application for her, she blocked me off completely without a goodbye. i tried to meet her at her home, but she just avoided me completely.
3 days ago, i went to her workplace, hoping for a proper talk to find some closure. i saw her with another guy. she had cheated on me, after all we have been through together for the past 9 months, without even a proper goodbye. that was my last time seeing her.
my first rs was such a shitty one. living together with someone can really help you see their true colours. i regret staying in this rs for so long, even after seeing all the red flags, genuinely hoping that some day she will change.
but i guess, some people never change. some people will never be grateful for what they have, until it's gone.
knowing that i really tried my best in providing everything for her, this breakup has hurt me so much that im not sure whether i would be capable of loving anyone else the same. i dont think i will ever be able to get over this completely. i feel used and thrown away like i meant nothing. whereever i go, our memories together would keep coming back.
what i learnt from this is: LEAVE before you get pulled even further into a hopeless rs. staying longer would just make it even more painful when it eventually ends..

60534,106967,"Exactly 1 year ago, I wrote a confession here. I shared about dating a guy who earned so much less than me, and I had concerns with that. At that time in the comment section, I got bashed a lot.
Anyway I took the feedback, I went ahead and agreed to be his gf. Today, we have broken up for 4 months. The reason for breaking is (again) because he earned too little, and therefore his mindset was too different from mine when it comes to financial goals and spending. I also find it was too hard to feel happy when I had to keep hearing him complaining about paying for dates (to clarify, most of the time we split 50/50, sometimes I treated him but when it was his turn, the complaints came out). On top of this, with a humble financial background also comes very uneducated behaviors (for example, being mean to family members or cruel to animals). Not saying it is the case for all who earns less, just saying it’s a common risk.
Hence, for those girls who feel alright dating down, good for you. I can’t. I’m not demanding to be treated like princess here. Thinking back on how I was bashed and advised to not be materialistic 1 year ago, I just feel bitter. How women are often looked down on even for asking for just a little bit of fairness in relationships.
Recently, I’ve started dating someone who earns more. It feels good that he is classy and willingly picks up the bill most of the time (although I still insist to pay for some to maintain 50/50). So I’m not in for materialism but pointing out the financial capabilities speak something.

60520,106951,"My last 2 ex gfs did not want children. We broke up for completely unrelated reasons.
Today my current gf told me she might never want children.
I am amazed at the consistency of child preferences of women I date. Is it becoming more prevalant these days or is there some other reason for this pattern? Might I be attracting a certain sort of woman and why? My gf's reason is her fear of having children will affect her career progression and her indignance about the unfairness that men do not have to give birth. My exes did not want children for fear of damaging their figure.
I am not opposed to not having children but my status quo is want to have children as I like them and that is also the usual path in life. I understand the benefits of not having children but I am not completely convinced.

Trust me they wont go out or marry a guy that is earning less than 4k.
This is because Even when they say want to stay in hdb, they want a big enough hdb and good location enough hdb which once again cost >600k . In addition, They still expect to be wined and dined, and with yearly regional trips and occasional staycations and gifts/flowers etc.
However you still have play the game. The reason is while you earn 4k, you also need their 4k
Ultimately society is quite realistic. While money cannot do everything, but without money you cant do anything.

The idea that having a family is the ultimate form of happiness could be true for some people, but there isn’t any way anyone would have experienced everything out there to make an accurate assessment of the thing that make you most happy. I can accept it when people tell me I have to get married and have children as a service to the country.

He then blamed me for being selfish and taking away his family time when all i needed was to find out why the sudden change in attitude bc at the start of the rs, he would do whatever to maximise and spend more time with me knowing that both our love language is quality time.
Im more upset at the fact that i got baited than anything else?

Don't wanna use dating apps because of the stigma. It's a last-resort as I have heard horror stories from that. Pretty sure I can meet guys irl first?
Currently single (for 2+ years) ever since I broke up with my first bf from JC, and keen on dating. What do you all think of the idea of dating a batchmate from my cohort? I feel like with dating a batchmate, since we'd have a lot in common and we can probably relate a lot to each other. But I don't know anyone else apart from my CG (clinical group).
I have a secret fantasy about dating an older guy too, so, hmm... I imagine that most of the guys in my batch are my age cos of army disruption, but I think that there should be a few who had completed NS first. There're also some who transferred in right?
Too bad I'm not chio la. Just a 5/10 (prob 6.5/10 with good makeup) plain Jane, and never had a guy confess enthusiastically to me before. If only there were a way for me to meet more my batchmates... I secretly want a cute oppa batchmate to confess to me hehehehe

60525,106955,"Everyday I wake up and think, man I love Computer Science. I can’t wait to learn more about CS!
Studying CS has actually helped me improve my EQ. CS2030 taught me the notion of covariance and contravariance. A little further digging into the theory taught me that, property of an object can be studied by examining how other objects interact with it, such as by passing it into programs, and also by studying the inheritance structure of the classes that the object came from. Similarly, thinking processes of a people can be studied by examining how they with other people, and examining their performance in routines. These routines can be exams, group projects, internships, jobs, or anything really. We can also study their inheritance structures: In the case of studying people, it will be the environment that they grew up in that produced them, and how these environments changed over time. It could be their friends, family, schools attended, interest groups… anything that they interact or have interacted with on a regular basis.
Gaining EQ is like Dynamic Programming. Just store (memorize) the solution to previous subcases (past human interactions) and then find the DP relation to the next case (future human interaction). Of course, different problems will have different solutions and different DP relations. Moving from one DP problem to the next is akin to moving from one social structure to the next. There will be a different culture (DP relation) to get used to, and it can be uncovered by studying and memorizing a few instances of example interactions, (subcases) possibly between 2 other people not including myself, and then generalizing.
Complexity Theory was especially interesting. Interactive and Zero Knowledge Proofs taught me to think clearer about information being revealed in daily conversations. This helps prevent accidental self-doxxing online. It also helps in constructing politically correct, non-answers when faced with sticky and awkward questions. When studying derandomization techniques, I found out that most researchers today believe that BPP = P, meaning that all problems solvable by an efficient random algorithm also has an efficient deterministic algorithm as a solution. Extending this to observing people, I feel that the many seemingly random choices many people make are actually part of some principles that they live by.

60530,106961,"The noise pollution first started in October 2022, and it has persisted ever since.
It is unclear to me if the concerned unit just moved in recently, as I live on the opposite block.
It seems to me that the family has a mentally ill child (maybe ADHD or autism) who kept hitting the metal grill gate for an obscene period of time, be it day or night.
As you know, the sound of the metal gate has a relatively high frequency, and thus, the noise could be clearly heard from a far distance.
In November 2022, the boy could be heard screaming non-stop throughout the entire night (well past midnight).
In addition, the family has a habit of not closing their door past midnight, which would only make the persistent noise pollution worse.
On numerous occasions, the mom could be seen as losing control over her emotions because she too started shouting loudly and randomly in the corridor.
I have asked a few neighbors who live on the same block as me if they can also hear the noise, and they can, but they have seemingly resigned their fate to the situation despite being mentally and emotionally ""tortured"" by the generated loud noise.
The general consensus I gather from those neighbors whom I spoke to is that ""HDB is like that one"" or ""I want to stay out of unnecessary trouble,"" etc.
This speaks volumes about Singapore society’s behavior as a whole: we complain, but we don’t even take any action.
I have raised the issue on two occasions with the HDB (with photos and video recordings), but the problem persists.
Instead, HDB gave me the same standard template answer not once but twice, which reads: ""When going about our daily routines, some activities will generate noise, and some of that noise can affect others, especially when we are living in close proximity with each other. For this reason, we urge everyone to be more considerate and to reduce noise that may impact our neighbors’ enjoyment of their homes, as well as to be more tolerant and patient with noise from the community.""
Yes, the situation has ""improved considerably"" now, and this statement is written in an ironic tone.
Now, the boy has grown ""smarter"" by hitting the metal gate for a couple of seconds, then hiding inside the house, coming out again, and repeating the same action continuously in the daytime.
Now, the boy would hit the interior cupboards at night instead of the front door’s metal gate to avoid detection and camera recording by the neighbors.
Or, if the boy wants to continue his hobby of generating noise pollution at night, his family will switch off the light on his behalf.
The family is doing this to ensure that it becomes difficult for his neighbors to capture video footage of their boy’s ""masterpiece.""
I had written an email to my MP, but she didn’t reply.
How about the grass-roots leaders?
Well, two of them live next to my unit—a husband and wife. It is sufficient to say that the couple created such a huge volume of noise pollution themselves too.
If I could already hear the noise from the opposite block, it is not difficult to imagine how torturous the experience might have been for the concerned household’s immediate neighbors.
On numerous occasions, it could be observed that the parents made no effort to rein in their suspected mentally ill child.
By the way, I am working from home, and the noise pollution is already affecting my daily routines and work performances.
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

I am interested to know whether maritime studies this industry is good in Singapore? Is the career prospects wide enough? please leave comments with any information you have! I will read it all!
As I applied for NUS bachelor in landscape architecture too, if I choose NUS I will get a direct admission to year 2, whereas if I choose NTU, I will have to start from Year 1 which will be 4 years of study.
I really need someone to help me and give me suggestions or advice on which option is better for me. I am currently losing confidence in landscape architecture this industry due to its prospect reason.... But if you have any info regarding to landscape industry prospects, please feel free to comment too!
