60480,106870,"Should I break up with him?
I have changed the story substantially to protect my identity but the advice will apply to my situation.
I met a guy during my first year. He was in his first year of medical school and I was in my first year of accounting. We hit it off right away. We shared similar tastes in food, in movies, in hobbies, we even took the same third-lang in secondary school. We've been dating for more than 8 years now. We don't fight, we always spend time together. Everything is better than I have ever imagined when it's just the two of us.
Recently we've been talking about marriage. It would have been a no-brainer for me to marry him were it not for this weird philosophy that he has about our responsibilities as spouses. He believes strongly that he is marrying me and not my family and likewise I am marrying him and not his family. According to him, I will be exempted of all my obligations to his family if I so want to be, and he should be given the same privilege. This, apparently, isn't just his idea. His whole family thinks this way, even his parents. His mom sat me down once to tell me that while I am always welcome, I will not be expected to do anything and she hopes I don't expect her son to do the same. One detail. Both his parents are doctors and they own and run a specialist clinic together. My dad is a taxi driver and my mom is a homemaker.
My mom and dad have been giving me pressure to soldier on with the marriage and they have indicated to me that they plan to ask for an obscene 5-figure amount in dowry and more than half of the banquet seats. His parents have also spoken to me and they said they will not be participating in any tradition, and all costs for the marriage will be borne 50/50. It's probably worth noting that my boyfriend's family do not celebrate any festivals (not Christmas, not CNY) and they are passionate atheists. I am pretty indifferent about my family's traditions but I don't know if I'm willing to get into a fight with my parents over what will come across as blatant disrespect. I also feel uneasy that my boyfriend does not believe in helping out with my duties to my family. One reason I want to marry is the fact that there are many challenges in life that are just easier to take on with help, most of these challenges involve my responsibilities to my family. I have a brother who is unfortunately autistic, and another brother who has a juvenile record and recently got a baby but refuses to work. He had this baby with a girl out of wedlock and now all of them are living in my parents' three-bedroom apartment. Most of the money I earn helps pay for all the problems that keep happening in my family. I don't like that I can't catch a break either. But it doesn't feel right to renegade on my family even when they are clearly suffocating.
I was fortunate enough to have had financial aid through the very elite schools that I grew up in. My friends are all from upper middle class families and I have spoken to them. Apparently they were quite uniform in their inability to support me on this issue because they also believe that it would be difficult for them to want to marry someone if they didn't first have assurances that their lives wouldn't be made more difficult post-marriage. In other words, most of them took the side of my boyfriend.
Am I the weird one to be expecting my future husband to share my burdens, however heavy they are? If I go through with this, I'm afraid of how ugly things can get with my boyfriend's family being of a completely different culture to mine. But if I do not, I don't know there is a guy out there that exists that I get along with while still being willing to support me.

60483,106875,"First of all, context. Family is very well-to-do. Mom doesn’t work (though she has a law degree) but dad ran his own law firm for 30 years, recently retired.
This is an issue with parents not paying for my wedding.
Mom doesn’t get involved in things. Dad has refused to speak to my girlfriend since we started dating and it’s all because my girlfriend is a Chinese-speaking, practicing Taoist from a poor family in Malaysia, and a vegetarian.
My dad is a banana. Doesn’t speak Chinese at all, read law at Cambridge (PSC scholar), freethinker. Doesn’t think I should marry this girl because she has a large low-income family and an even larger low-income extended family and he thinks I am getting myself into a lot of trouble by marrying her. My girlfriend doesn’t know English very well, so she prefers to speak Mandarin with a heavy Malaysian accent. She’s from a small town in Malaysia. She came to Singapore to work but her family are all still back in Kedah. She goes back often. I’ve been there a couple of times.
My girlfriend requested if we could have two banquets, one in Singapore and one for her extended family and friends back in her hometown. My dad told me if I had chosen to marry a middle-class Singapore girl from an English-speaking family he would’ve paid for everything. He would have also bought us a condo and a car. But since I have decided to marry this girl, which to him isn’t a very smart thing to do, he will not pay for anything.
My older brother married his JC sweetheart from Hwa Chong and my dad literally paid for a Fullerton Hotel banquet, an entry level Lexus, and they are in the process of looking for a condo, will also be paid for by my dad. Besides the point.
I don’t have money right now for a wedding, let alone 2. My fiancé said that the wedding in Malaysia is a must, and my parents have to go to Kedah for a bride price negotiation ritual that my dad has categorically refused to participate. Called it idiotic. My mom has also called it “incredibly stupid” and refused to come with me to Malaysia without my dad. My fiancé’s parents said they wouldn’t agree to the marriage if all of these formalities are not done. My fiancé is powerless. She has a rather meek personality.
My fiancé doesn’t want to register our marriage before these formalities are done because she feels she needs her parents’ blessing or else she wouldn’t be able to face her family. Wants me to find a way to convince my parents to participate. My dad has repeatedly used the phrase “third-world bullshit” and I don’t think he’s ever coming around. One way is to convince my mom to do it alone but she’s as much of a banana as my dad is and she also hates tradition.
I feel stuck because my fiancé’s wants her parents’ blessing, her parents will only give us their blessing if my parents participate in the rituals and come to an agreement, but my parents do not agree to my marrying this girl in the first place. Even if this first part is done, I still have no money for a banquet.
Advice?

60484,106878,"Hello,
NUS SoC alumni here. TL;DR started a startup, declined an acquisition offer last year and the business is growing. This is not about the startup, this is a tribute to my parents.
When we decided to not get acquired last year at the last minute, we had run out of money. It was a gut decision and we did not have backup options for fundraise. I felt it was right and my parents supported me. My dad said I should not think about anything below $100Mn.
Since we were not profitable and I was hearing NOs from investors, I was worried about how to pay salaries. My parents stepped in and gave me some cash which helped support the team. All this while, they have been paying my living expenses (I stopped taking salary of course). They paid me to fly in the region to meet customers.
I had a dispute with my flatmate and they paid for my rental when he decided to make me pay for renovation etc. upfront. They told me to stand up for myself and not get bullied. They transferred me the money and got one of their friends to bring some cash for me next week to help with living expenses.
My brother is in SF and works for FAANG, so all my groceries and grab are on his card. My parents would not let him pay for my rent etc. and he is free to live his life. He lives in a luxury apartment with a cat and does not have to worry. He can spend all his time and focus on his work.
The thing is that my mom is a housewife and my dad is a salaried employee in a developing country. They already used some of the savings to get me to NUS. I had a full scholarship at NTU but I really wanted to go to NOC, so they let me go to NUS. I never could qualify for NOC (rejected 4 times) and my parents never mentioned it once. My dad stayed with me for 15 days when I first came to Singapore thirteen years ago because I was only 15 and made sure everything was okay.
They supported me in continuing to live out my entrepreneurial dream. I got slightly disillusioned in between and gave some interviews to FAANG and had one very good offer. When I shared this with them, they would just tell me to do what I want. And I could not convince myself to take up a job because it would prevent me from having a shot at being somebody who history remembers.
I did not know earlier but know now that they actually sold off their property and took loans to pay for me. I would never have known had I not chanced upon the opened post on our dining room table while I was home. I have no idea what I did in my last life to deserve such parents. I do not. And I do not know what the future will be. We are profitable and growing now but I still do not take a salary. We have a lead investor etc. and I likely will be able to pay myself a little bit in the coming months.
I am not sure if I will ever be able to repay them. I screwed up so many times in university life and even while doing the startup - slacking off, doing random things like picking up chess, not showing up to meetings on time etc.. They would scold me a little for all of this but would never ever tell me money is a problem. I never had that burden and if I knew about what they have done, I would have taken up a job. My mom always asks me if I am eating and exercising right, never about how much I am spending.
If you see someone trying to be successful on their own, don't just think of their work or preseverance. The real MVPs might be their parents. They would never get the glory. And they would never ask for something in return. I love my mom and dad so much, and I will still be pulling their leg or not calling them. They would not want me to know and that is how it shall be.

60488,106882,"My greatest regret was losing her
I thought she would come back to me, considering how we have great moments and memories together.
I went on an overnight trip with a female friend without telling her. She was just a female friend and nothing more.
When she found out, I was pissed that she didn't trust me and wanted to break up with me. We were together for almost a year. I thought she overreacted.
It's been 11 months since she left and I still cannot forget her. It seems like she has met someone new. I really regret not apologising and trying to win her back but it's too late.
I dated several girls but I don't have the same frequency or chemistry with them. I keep thinking of you every day and every night.
XY, if you're reading this, I'm sorry to hurt you and not think from your POV. I'm envious of the guy who now receives all your love... Your random handwritten notes, the way your eyes light up when you are surprised or happy, your adorable laughter and the way you hold onto me when we sleep. I miss your cooking and I miss you very much. Although I wish you happiness, I really wish I was the reason to make you smile and laugh again. Ilyvm and I'm sorry.

60479,106865,"Social media is ruining my gf's self esteem. How to ease her insecurity?
I'm with my gf for 2 years. We don't have any major issues other than the fact that she allows herself to be affected by what others post. Like people who post ig pics that they went to fancy restaurants and expensive holidays, indulging in branded bags and wearing luxury items. Posting as though they are living a fantastic life. I mean, I don't really care as I think most of these are superficial and fake and also attention seeking.
My gf on the other hand, will feel jealous and sulk when she mentions so and so just went to where and where. Like we are planning to see cherry blossoms this year. She is ok with that but asked if we can visit somewhere further year end. I know she has friends who can go on multiple trips in a year. But we only budget for one trip this year. I'm not saying year end I won't be planning anything but its likely we will not travel out for December.
She also told me her friends rents branded clothes and bags and asks me to sponsor her as a bday gift as she wants to try. I don't see the point. Its money spent but end of the day you own nothing. Only memories of the things worn if you had photos taken? I would rather we have a nice dinner and watch a concert.
She's starting to act like I should be more supportive of her wanting to match up to her materialistic friends which I don't think there is a need to. Both of us are earning a decent wage for our age but I think we are more on the thrifty kind of lifestyle. She does own a few nice and fancy items which I find it ok to treat ourselves once in a while. I just don't see the need to rent branded items and clothes.

60490,106890,"Parents that cant afford to have children should not have children
Here’s a little background about myself and my family:
We are a family of 4 and earn just enough to not qualify for any financial aid, however we are also in debt.
My sibling and i are matriculating into nus this year.
I have watched my parents work so hard to bring the both of us up and I am very grateful for that. Recently, I decided to find out how much does it take to raise a child in Singapore and after factoring my parents’ income and the cost of living in Singapore, i was devastated. We literally scrapped through every month with little to no savings. I feel like such a burden to my parents, stopping them from living their lives. They were really living just to support me and my sister.
Now having found a full time job whilst waiting for my matriculation, I’m really glad that I’m able to give my parents allowance to make up for their support while bringing us up. However i am worried that they will be pressured when i have to quit working and start studying this coming August.
Hence i feel that if a couple can’t afford to have children, they shouldn’t have kids. When the child finds out about how hard their parents have to work to bring them up, it really takes a toll on their mental health.

60478,106864,"Hi yalls, 24M here, will graduate uni next year. TLDR, I wanna know what y'all think of someone getting a BTO/resale flat with his single mother. Reasons: we do not own a flat, and we currently live in a 1-bedroom rental flat.
I do plan to get married in the future, but I'm not currently dating, and at the rate that I'm going I'm probably going to be single for a while, 'cos I'm just constantly doing internships and studying so I don't actively meet anyone.
So, my parents divorced when I was 1yo, and never really had much contact with my father. Due to certain reasons, my mom lost the matrimonial home and we've been staying in a rental, 1-bedroom HDB for a few years now. (I have an elder sister but she has married out so she's kinda out of the picture)
I have thought of renting a place when I graduate but I don't feel good about spending close to 1000 a month on rent, but yet I can't seem to be satisfied with sleeping in the living room for the next few years. And hence I've thought about this. (My earning potential is around 5k-6k/mth as a fresh grad, and hence the downpayment amt isn't really a concern as long as I have 1 or 2 years.)
But then this does still raise a few concerns, right? For the ladies, would you be okay with settling down with someone like me, knowing well that you won't be able to do the conventional BTO, or maybe even the fact that you might have to live with your mother-in-law?

60486,106880,"I need the thoughts of the NUSWhispers community on this.
I (M24) was seeing this girl (F23) for about 9 months, known each other for close to 2 years. Reason why we broke up was because my parents disapproved of our relationship quite strongly, and we've been through multiple break ups because of this. But this time when we patched things up we were not officially boyfriend/girlfriend but we were still emotionally committed to each other. So I thought.
Just yesterday, I received an IG follow request from someone with a unique name, and based off what my girl told me in the past regarding her exes and their names, it seemed odd to receive a random request (I usually don't get many requests and my account is private with a unique handle) from someone that vaguely sounded like my girl's ex so I asked her about it. I was expecting a ""oh its not him"", or a ""omg it's him, why is he following u on ig"" reply, but what happened next shocked me.
She replied: ""Oh hahah yea he was just curious, just ignore him"".I was like ""you're still talking to your ex????""Her: ""yeah occasionally, just casually mentioned you a few times""Me: ""You're talking about me, the one you currently have unresolved feelings for, with your ex, whom you've supposed to have no more unresolved feelings for??""Her: ""we aren't even dating officially atm, why are u being so controlling""
That was the last straw that broke the camel's back. I recognize gaslighting when I see it, I was not even trying to control her actions or who she sees or talks to, I simply was taken aback and shocked, and somehow adding 4 question marks to my reply makes me a controlling person. I told her it's over, and she said ""ok wtv"". Blocked her everywhere shortly after.
Theres alot of backstory to our relationship and it's complicated, both parties have made mistakes but we were working on them, I was determined to fight for her, for us, and talk to my parents once I got past a busy stage in my life (in 3 weeks). But this was too much for me. I blocked her on everything, and I don't want to see her ever again. I know I did what I thought was the right thing, but I wanted to ask:
Is it ever okay to still be contact with your ex, when you're (granted, not in a committed relationship, but still) emotionally committed to someone else (me), and not tell me about it? Even if she swears they are just friends? Also, how do you reasonably bring that issue up without sounding insecure?
P.s. she works in marketing/IT where basically alot of success rides upon having good and cordial connections with people, her ex happens to be a software engineer, so idk why she thought it was a good idea to keep him around. Please make this make sense.

We were waiting for the lift, and a family with a baby stroller, came and went straight into the lift that just arrived, even though we waited longer than them for the lift.
Then came two other people, an uncle and an aunty, who were both walking fine (no walking sticks whatsoever). My sis was going into the lift first, and she was trying to manoveur (??) her way into the lift, while I was waiting to do so next.
That aunty was already trying to get into the lift and passing me by to get into the lift, despite them arriving later than us.
When I pushed the wheelchair into the lift, she kicked the back of my shoes so you know she was definitely rushing to get into the lift.
