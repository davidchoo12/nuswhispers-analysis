60103,106101,"He’s 29 I am 23. We know each other from dating app and go exclusive for less than a year. He really dotes on me a lot through monetary but sometimes I just feel insecure.
He is the one who suggests to go exclusive. However this exclusive period for 7 months, he didn’t ask if he wants me to be his gf but we are just like in a relationship. He will introduce me to his friends and biological sisters, travel together, buy me airticket whenever I say “I miss home (Malaysia)”, delivers me food whenever I work late, links his credit card to my grab app and even talks to me about BTO.
I got quite confused and asked him few times, “what are we?” He always just shrug off the topic or just say something like “whatever you think we are.” I am a bit insecure recently because he is always on his phone these days when we date and sometimes tilted his phone away from me (which he never done that before).
Yes, monetary wise he showered me a lot, and of course I buy him things too. Emotionally, I would say he tries to comfort me whenever I am angry at him but after apologising he will just say “I have apologise, what you want me to do?” Or “you’re just too sensitive, think whatever you like la.” And the next day after our arguments, he text like normal again.
Guys, help, I dk what are we.

60100,106096,"TLDR; Got ghosted after a 2 month situationship and I don't know how to save this rs. I don't want to ask for closure or just end things, but want to give her a way to start talking again without feeling the pressure to explain herself. Or if I'm the reason she's ghosting, I want to talk it out with her and try to fix things. How should I talk to her about this?
So I met a girl and it's pretty obvious we have mutual interests in each other. We text every day and go out every week, we reciprocated each other's flirting and physical touch. We were damn sweet like the kind that'll cook for each other, prepare surprise gifts or like stand there to watch each other leave when saying goodbye
I was planning to confess but out of no where she hasn't replied for 10 days and ignored all texts to meet. I triple texted her already. I feel like she's intentionally cutting it off.
I know if she really intends to cut that I should just let it go and not pester her but it really feels sad to let this go like this. I rlly value her and want to at least try to save this rs, please dun tell me to just leave her in the comments :')
She's also the quiet, shy, non-confrontational type, if I don't reply it will probably just fizzle out. I don't think I should pressure her to explain the ghosting cause she will prob be too shy to explain the real reason. And if she feels too pressured or awkward it might ruin any opportunity to start talking again in the future (say after finals when she's in a better headspace)
I just thought we're off to a good start, but I hope we can talk things out to see if there's any misunderstanding or if there's anything I can do to change or make things right. Honestly if it's because she saw some red flag in me, I'd like to see if it's something I can do to change. How can I communicate with her without sounding needy or stressful to her?
Admins please help this lost soul and dun filter this:( I rlly like her

We clicked instantaneously (at least it seemed so) and the few 2-3 months were full of happy daily texts and occasional dates. Things went downhill subsequently because you had too many partners (took me too long to realise) to manage and whatever I was asking for as a date always seem to be too much of an expectation.
It’s been a year and I’m still very much left heartbroken, but yet I still think of you and miss you every single day. I wanted you back despite being hurt many times and how you made me feel so worthless at times.
I wonder if you will ever get to read this but I just want to tell you that the silly ygf still wants you badly, and as long as you’re willing to change and be honest, I’ll always be there for you.

60105,106105,"I'm not too sure if this is the right place to post. Admin please do not delete this. I really need some insight regarding this issue.
I'm a female 24, graduated from NUS about a year ago. To all the female solo travellers, I would like to know if this has ever happen to any of you before and how do ya'll react to this.
As with the majority of the solo traveller, we tend to stay at a hostel due to its cheap rates. I have been solo travelling and staying in hostel most of the time. Often I do not faced any issue and find it to be very very safe.
However, recently while I was backpacking to Thailand and staying in a hostel, I found out that a few of my bra, panties and clothes were stolen. What's worst was that some of my used bra and panties had cum stain in them. I was utterly shock as this had never happened to me before. I tried to tell the hostel staff but they said they could not do anything about it as they have placed a disclaimer to remind the tenants to take care of their belongings. They did offered to make a police report but that didn't help much as I was about to head home in a few days. Looking through the CCTV also didn't help as there were multiple people entering the room at different times, making it hard to tell who stole exactly.
What's worst was that there's this other female tenants whose lingerie was stolen and stain with cum as well.
I just want to know if this is common or has every happen to other solo female traveller before. If so, how do ya'll react to such situation? What are your next precautionary steps.

I've been talking to girls but I realise halfway through I might feel that things will never work out be it because of dealbreakers, looks or other reasons. But I'm quite new to dating apps and I don't know how to end things. I used to just ghost the girl. But I soon realise it's actually quite hurtful to the girl, especially if you've been talking for like weeks. Sometimes telling them the honest answer feels worse cause like after a first date you realise there's no attraction how do you tell her? I don't want her to feel bad about her looks. Saying something like ""I'm not ready for a relationship"" is kind of bs also

Not that I am trying to show off, but I am naturally born with a nice figure and tend to get more attention from guys (Maybe being shorter is good?) The fact is, I dont even hit the gym and yet I have an athletic figure.
In fact, some of my female friends have been eating sour grapes lately, claiming that a rich guy who is trying to court me is purely after my looks.

60102,106098,"Replying to #106059
Regarding my gambling bf. Thanks for sharing your story. And all the comments regarding my post. Appreciate all the positive and negative comments. I feel so nice writing here as I don’t really talk to my frns abt this kind of stuff.
So it all started when he get to know my brother in law and his friends. I brought him to meet my family members during cny. He got close to my brother in law real quick through poker. My bro in law was playing poker with his frns and asked if he wanna join too. They started to play poker during cny season, mostly every night. I was mad but i did not say much as he would said aiya, only cny ma. Don’t worry. So I don’t really mind.
My father used to be a gambler but then he started to change at one point of life. Idk when but i rmb was quite old like 50s? Now he is in 70s. He always regretted he gamble so much and wish he could save more money. Now he is retired and i am supporting to pay all the utility and bills with 2 of my sisters. 2 of my bros do not save money and often borrow money from us. Now my father has changed. Im grateful for that. But the worst part is, now my mum is the one keep gambling away all the money. She often borrow money from family member to pay back all the debts. Idk how much she owe but I am so tired keep nagging her over the same thing. So from my background, you can see that I don’t really like gambler. I always help them and feel like is my responsibility to help them. Of course the responsibility come with a lot of stress. I sometimes cry out of nowhere.
Some comments mentioned that it’s just a phase and it’s normal that guys play poker as a hobby as it is a probability and social game. I do really hope that it’s just a phase. Sorry for the long story, back to my bf. My brother actually came back from oversea few months back and he kinda knw my bf likes to play poker through my brother in law. So he invited my bf to join so I thought it was ok. One time only ma. And my brother gonna fly soon. Soon i regretted, as everything started from there. They created a whatsapp group and he often play poker like almost every weekend or sometimes even weekdays. He reduces it to 2 days per month now as i used the break up card. If im in a good mood, i would allow him to go more as he will randomly hint me the whatsapp group got ppl jio.
Now my brother fly back oversea dy, he still ply often as he is close to my brother’ frns now. Lmao I don’t even know whether this is a good thing.
Lets talk abt winning. He losses quite alot in the first few mths, paying tuition fees. Often time, he would mentioned that he use alot of money and the fact i know he losses money as he usually don’t mention abt this since he is earning quite a decent salary. He would pay for most of our meals. Even when he losses money, he still bought me a bag and perfume. I would buy expensive gift for him during some occasion as well. He is telling me now he is getting the hang of the poker game and always sharing me the fun thing during the game.
The thing I’m concerned is, he bought a condo and probably can get the house key nx year. If he continues like this, will he able to save up money for renovations and furniture or even house loan. I just feel insecure. We have discussed about this concern of mine and he mentioned that he will control the limit and reassure me that i do not have to worry.
I will give it some time and if this is phase won’t change or is getting worse then i will eventually give up.

Dude... after reading your post, I can't help but budge in and just have to offer you my thoughts. Take it with a pinch of salt, or dont take it at all. But I hope what I share to you might help you a little bit more on your dating journey.
Long story short, The girl-friend that you have been in contact with for a while now, I don't think she's into you, at least based on your story. If a girl is interested in you, she will never, and I mean, NEVER ask you up front whether you have a crush on her, if at all. The one thing you must understand is that girls are never direct or straightforward with the guys they like. In your case, it is obvious that you have been showing her too many hints that you are crushing on her pretty bad. And if she asks you the question, it just means that she has been suspecting this for a long time, and confirmed this with your confession. In my opinion, you have lost this game, and now your ""crushing"" fate is all up to her mercy. You fell right into her bait; she may now choose what to do with you however she wishes. Even if she likes you back just a little bit, does not mean that she is willing to be tgt with you. Girls require a lot more than mere ""crushes"" to be in a relationship with someone. Hell, even if a girl hates you to the core, she may still want to be together with you if you do the game right ---> Now this is why a lot of girls end up with abusive boyfriends.
The number one rule in dating game is never, never ever confess your feeling to the opposite sex. Whoever confess first, basically admit defeat and resigned their fate to the other's hands. I can go on and on about what you can do, and should have done but anyway a lot of ppl are probably going disagree with me; besides, everyone has their own relationship journey. So I wish you luck with yours and take this post with a pinch of salt. Hopefully I am wrong and you will have closed the deal in the next few weeks. :) OR better, just move on and find a new target cuz this girl is just going to play the long game with you. It's not worth the time. Singapore is small but not that small.
Tl;dr: gg bro.

60107,106114,"It is a common saying around SoC that it is way easier for girls to get internships at FAANG. For example, for 2022 Google Internship there is like around 70% girls? Some may say its unfair but I opine that there is a very clear business reasoning behind this.
I would argue that at least for the entry position, a incompetent female is way more valuable than a regular competent male (not so pro, but good enough). I would argue that for the value that female provides for the company in terms of PR, diversity numbers and marketing is way more than whatever another the other male candidate can provide technically.
Consider this. You are Google and its 2021, money is essentially free. Woke culture is at an all time high. Investors and the media demands an equal representation of gender. So what do you do? You go to the nearby college campus and start mass hiring females. Who cares if they are incompetent? Most entry level graduates barely do work anyways. You maybe spend couple of millions a month (which is chump change) and you make your diversity numbers look nice and pretty. Investors are happy and the media call you a champion for diversity and an industry standard. Suppose, instead you hire a few more male engineers who may be competent. What are you gonna make them do? What extra use do they bring to your company that your existing workforce (which are already chilling) is unable to do? Worse still, your numbers are now even worse and the people starts flaming you. In essence, you brought negative value to your company!
Once you follow this line of reasoning, it becomes quite clear. Now it is 2022, Papa Powell has turned off the money printer. The bloat has to be cut and as a result you do see that a lot of these females being laid off. So perhaps moving forward, we would possibly see a shift. In fact, now HFTs are the new hot thing and they seem to actually value talent. So maybe there would be brighter days ahead.

So I confirmed my feelings, then I reassured her that I wouldn't try anything funny, I assumed the feelings aren't mutual so I'm ready to face rejection. But surprisingly, she didn't reject me outright and told me when she started noticing my interest and etc. After that, our convo resumed back to other topics. she's a pretty shy person so I'm not sure if she's trying to give me the green light or not. Also, can anyone let me know when a girl knows that a guy likes her, does she gets disgusted about him, or if not, what is actually going through her head?
Does this mean she has an interest or even a slight interest in me? I'm pretty confused

60104,106103,"Reading the comments of #106088 makes me wonder if the people making those comments are abusers, victims or simply ignorance.
Abusive parents are more prevalent in Singapore than one would expect. Something that is not addressed or recognize as an issue by our government, I’d say even suppressed.
Majority of the abuse from parents are not physical, they are mostly mental, they are also impossible to prove. When mental abuse is reported without physical abuse, the adults will do nothing or make you come to terms with your parents. I don’t fault them, it is often very difficult to produce strong concrete evidence. how should they differentiate teaching a child and mentally abusing them?
Even when abuse is proven, the child’s custody is a huge issue. Most will be considered lucky if they get a personal protection from their parents and their grand parents ain’t crazy. But the reality is, most of the time, the child will be in a worst situation.
Very often when you have a child emotionally damaged and no longer wish to have a relationship with the parent, difficult in forming intimate relationship or any relationship you’re likely looking at a victim of serious abuse.
In most cases, a child is literally brainwashed into thinking that the abuse is okay and would even defend similar action done by other perpetrators. These people would often continue the cycle of abuse. If you belong to this category, I hope you one day have the self awareness to know.
Despite the 20/20 views of the ignorants, most people will actually live with their abusers for years. It is often difficult to break away from their abusers and the abuse is desensitized. I suspect that is what her dad experienced.
So to the people who either lack the empathy or the understanding, please don’t embarrass yourself.

60117,106128,"Hopeless Love
It was not love at first sight. I have known you for a while… and the attraction to you came out of the blue one day.
I thought it was just an admiration and the feeling would be gone after a while. Instead, the feeling grows overtime and I really miss you so much after not seeing you for months.
I really like you romantically. I wish I could tell you that personally… but we don’t text and see each other anymore.
Hey A, I am in love with you! I really love you and I miss you so much! (I wish you could see this and text me again)

60121,106126,"I'm 29m and have been working in the IT industry for 5 years. I have been dreading day-to-day as a salaryman and always wanted to try to start my own IT company in software development.
With the recent #metalayoffs and #badeconomy, many have advised me not to quit my current job. Then again, I'm feeling physically and mentally exhausted being an employee, average salary from an SME with no OT pay but working till late is the norm.
Should I just take a leap of faith and try out my goal?
