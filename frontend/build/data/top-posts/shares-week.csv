59566,105002,"Dating my bf close to 3 months but I saw something on his YouTube feed that might be a red flag?
We were watching YouTube together, but I notice his home page is full of videos of people like Jordan Peterson, and the titles of the videos are quite insensitive. I did not question him then, but when I researched myself, I found out that these people are like men's rights activists and are quite misogynistic.
I would consider myself a feminist, so I brought up his YouTube history with him, and he says he just watches it ""for fun"". Idk if this is true, or will he abuse me or something in the future. So far, he has never been physical with me and has been quite nice. We do have occasional arguments, but he would apologise later.
But I do notice lately that he has been less gentlemanly compared to when we first started dating. Like previously he would always pay for our dates, and sometimes I would offer to split, but he never would let me pay. But nowadays, often he actually accepts when I offered to pay half. I mean, I know I shouldn't expect him to pay for all our dates, but I just felt disappointed how he treated me so well before, but he changed after getting comfortable with me. I feel like those videos are making him less gentlemanly.
Idk if this is a red flag I should look out for, or should I tell him to stop watching those videos? Any girls have bfs who watches those videos?

I don't know how long more do I have in this world but I do have things I wish I had done. I wished that my husband had been truthful to me before we have got married that he have feelings for other people and not lied to me (I suspected before but he declined so i chose to trust him) at least before I got married, I would have a choice to accept it or call off the wedding. (I had only found out about this until almost a decade long with him) I wished I had went to more places and not just save or spend it on other people. I wished I had enjoyed more in life. I wished I had the courage to speak up my feelings to people when I had the chance. I wished I had removed that home wrecker long ago and trust my instincts but not trust her because she had an affair with my husband. Sometimes I wonder if bad people will have their karma. But to everyone out there, I hoped you do not have any regrets like I do because you only live once. Be grateful for what you already have, have the courage to get rid of negative people in your life, do what makes you happy and be nice to people who loves you.

59579,105038,"Seen a couple of posts in this page talking about boyfriends having close female friends. But still posting this in attempt to clear my mind and hopefully get some good advice.
My bf of 1 yr+ has a close female friend from uni days, B. My bf said they only meet once every few months and don’t communicate often other than to arrange meetups. He did tell me whenever he meets B, but never asked me to tag along or intro me to her before. At first, I never questioned their relationship and trusted my bf that it’s purely platonic. I thought since B seems happily married for few years already, unlikely anything will happen.
However, recently my gut feeling tells me something’s sus about them. A few things that happened:
- These days, almost every time we meet, I catch my bf texting B. She’ll tell him little things like what she eats, her travel plans, ask for his opinion on house purchase (my bf is not in real estate industry btw) etc. And he replies her immediately even while he is tgt with me eating / watching shows. Whereas he usually takes hours to reply my texts.
- For my bf’s bday this year, B bought him a lavish gift and she even drove over to his house to pass him the gift and bday cake at midnight. Isn’t that too much for a normal guy friend that you got no feelings for?
- My bf is damn lazy to dress up but he will put in effort to look nice for B. Once I went out with him before he met B, and he purposely went home early to change before meeting her. He said it’s because the place they’re dining at has smart casual dress code. He never even brought me to such places before!
- Once I was unwell and alone at home on a Sat night and asked him to come over, but he went ahead to meet B for dinner instead, saying he felt bad to cancel. Before the dinner, we talked on the phone and had a little argument about priorities. He got angry and asked me why must I be so unhappy with him meeting B on a Sat night, when B’s husband is perfectly fine about it? Which is totally out of point. He didn’t even ask me how I’d settle my meal or how I was feeling. In fact he ghosted me from the time they met until late afternoon the next day. I was so upset and hurt.
I want to know if these things my bf and B did are normal, or should I really be worried about these two? Wild thoughts are running in my head right now, thinking what if they used to hook up in the past. Or could he have chased her in the past but got friendzoned, and now both catching feelings again…..
Also need advice on how to communicate my insecurity to my bf without sounding unreasonable and making him turn defensive.

59588,105043,"AITA?
I was earning around 60k to 70k per annum for 10 years before quitting to be a sahm. My husband earns more than me. My husband and I paid half each during the initial payment for the house with a remaining loan of 200k. We have separate and joint accounts. He has taken over paying for almost all the expenses for both of us. Including giving me an allowance which I was able to save from it too. We are thrifty, we don't own a car.
During the course of our marriage, he had asked me twice if we can repay some of the home loan, using both our savings. I've obliged as I wanted to ease his burden. I've not need to spend from my own pocket as he's given me a supplementary card for all expenses and he also paylah whenever I pay for things. From kid to house stuff and even my own personal shopping, insurance and other smaller bills he would paylah me sometimes and will do it when I ask too. Basically he's paying for almost everything and I'm grateful for that. I'm also a simple person. I used to buy Chanels and Pradas but have since adjusted my spending habits since becoming a mom. I can live on 500 or less a month if I want to. I don't scrimp when it comes to food. I can buy things on sale but I also won't deprive my child of a new book or toy on birthdays or xmas when my child asks for it.
We won a decent amount not long ago and we used that to fully repay our condo. We are debt free since. We didn't tell anyone about it.
Recently his family member asked if we can invest an amount in their business. Promising huge returns. All along I'm not on good terms with them and I don't trust them either. They have been changing what they do all along. My husband would like us to contribute to show support. He say I got the spare cash, why not? I have a strong feeling their business will fail again and we won't get back single cent. My relatives said me and my husband are the only ones staying in condo, we should give others a chance to upgrade from hdbs. I think it's rubbish talk.
I don't want my husband to help them either. I have plans to work when my child gets older but whatever I have now, it's my own savings. I feel very annoyed his relatives act like I ought to help them. I'm not a big investor so I prefer to keep most of my money in banks. I do share and invest in the same stocks as my husband so even though my husband don't really know the exact amount that I have, he has a rough idea that I have more than 100k. I know its not a lot. But since I'm not working right now, it's my lifeline.
AITA for refusing to give his relatives a single cent and also stopping my husband from helping them?

THE CORNERS OF HIS HOUSE HAVE A LOT OF SPIDERS AND THEIR WOBWEBS AND I'M AFRAID OF SPIDERS AF. Like deathly afraid - will jump up, shriek, and run. My family has always been helping kill them... and from young till now, I have never managed to kill one myself. The last time I found one in my room and no one was around, I ran out of the house until my brother came back to kill it.
Where he is from and raised, he doesn't care about animals/insects and respects them - only killing them when truly necessary if they are pests (such as cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes). Other insects he will catch and release. He allows spiders to stay in the house as he believes they will keep mosquitoes and flies away by eating them.
So now I'm at a conundrum...he knows I'm afraid of spiders and has been trying to convince me that they are good but I can't...at the same time he won't clear the spiders as he says without them, there were a lot of mosquitoes...
It seems kinda lame but our relationship is now at an impasse cause of...spiders. A bit desperate for some advice!

59582,105031,"Re: #104917 Some startup advice you might find useful.
1. Coming from someone who did take Softbank's check in a past life: don't feel bad that you missed it. On hindsight, we took them too early and it sounds like you'd have too. At the stage you're at, it's so much more important to diversify your active investor base. I've seen many friends' businesses fail because they brought on a large brand name fund who didn't add any value besides cash.
2. For an early founder, an inactive or non-activist investor might seem great because it will take heat off you. But over time I've come to realize that active investors are better if they can be at the right level of ""active"". One problem with large funds is that they tend to be inactive investors and needlessly occupy up a useful board seat.
3. My last two rounds were oversubscribed over 4x, and we turned down marquee funds like Tiger Global, Sequoia etc. I liken building a round to assembling an MMORPG raid party:
- Get 1-2 lead investors.
- Get 1-2 follow-on anchors that can potentially lead a follow-on round. These are usually larger than the lead of your current round, but are just piggybacking off your lead investor's due diligence.
- Get 1-2 ""utility"" investors, who provide some hands-on like customer referrals, recruiting, or actual business advice. These are often micro-VCs, because you're their most important portfolio company, or because their partners were recent founders themselves. It's nice if this happens to be your lead investor(s) too, because then you have a useful board member.
- Get an investor that validates your business model, e.g. had a highly publicized exit in a similar segment.
- Get 1-2 investors who are target customers and can give product feedback. You might be able to find a good board member from this group too.
- Get 2-3 cheerleaders, who will always vote in your favor. One might be a good board member.
4. One of the best investors in my career had less than $80M AUM, because we mattered more than everything else in their portfolio - and they worked nearly as hard as a full time employee to help us succeed - and in turn we singlehandledy 10x'ed their portfolio. Another investor helped us build our network stack. Another investor had no brand name, but saved us about 1/3 as much in cash as they invested because they had free office space in Menlo Park.
5. I trust you will become a multi-millionaire and realize many of the plans you listed. When it happens, I don't recommend an instant lifestyle creep on how you spend on others (family trip, donation) when you do.
6. This may seem counterintuitive, but the most effective investment of the first $1-10M is to splurge on ways to keep your body nourished that seem like lifestyle excesses. Think of it this way: if your company is burning >$2M of cash per month, a $40k first class flight on your 1 week vacation is often worth it because it will keep your mind that 4% more nourished over the next 2 weeks. To begin, the decisions you'll make cumulatively in those 2 weeks have >25x notional value compared to that flight. But more importantly, a 4% improvement in decisionmaking is a lot - it probably has an effect of 40% notional value.
7. Other examples of things I found useful to spend the first $10M on: custom house with more guest space; multiple fridges and dishwashers; better bedding; extra condos around the areas where I have the highest probability density; spare cars that I leave at a few destination airports; a personal assistant; private chef; biweekly massages; storage space to clear the clutter; landscaping services; multiple identical copies of travel gear; identical copies of gym gear etc. $10M is a small amount, and these things add up fast. But it's hard to make the next $100M unless you spend on these things.
8. Spend a lot on minimizing variance. Been there and done that and a fluctuating sleep schedule is not something to be happy about because of point 6: it means you're making decisions maybe just that 1-4% worse through the week. I used to stay overnight before every exam so pulling all-nighters came naturally to me, but I saw a steep drop-off in my ability to pull an all-nighter after 27. For example, you can achieve lower variance (and better sleep) by flying your personal assistant out to every place a day before you so he/she can arrange everything in the room the way you want it ahead of time.
9. Alternative asset classes (HF, PE, angel group etc.) take up substantial mental energy and opportunity cost. The amount of effort to manage your taxes for 1 angel investment might exceed the amount you're investing. As boring as it sounds, when I got my first big liquidity event, I had so much cash for two years that I was gradually TWAP'ing into one boring index ETF position by the millions.
I hope none of this advice comes across as patronizing. 60+ in 3 years is better than I had managed at my first stint - so you must be killing it! Keep it up and I wish you all the best.
P.S.: I also wrote #104647 and #104658, which you might find helpful.

59569,105012,"tldr; AITA when my bf half-cancels on our staycay to attend a friend’s wedding and i’m upset about it?
we booked a staycay in early aug for the last weekend of aug, and this week he just got invited to his friend’s wedding. also, he is unable to bring a +1 as the friend said there are not enough seats. he said that he’ll be going on saturday from 6pm onwards so i’ll be alone all the way until midnight-ish in the room. he said he’ll come back after that and spend the night with me.
Firstly, he accepted the friend’s invite so late minute, and that he did not care about how I’d feel being left alone in the room for half a day when this is supposed to be our staycay. It’s like damn sus for a close friend to send an invitation so last minute. & I don’t think he respects my time and treats me like an option. I’ve turned down my friends’ or family’s invites to go out on that particular weekend because we got our staycay booked. But I don’t think he understands that this is basic respect.
I won’t be upset at all if his friend invited him before we made plans and I won’t stop him from going at all. I just find it very disrespectful for half-canceling on me we agreed to spend the weekend together beforehand. He made it seem like I’m making mountains out of molehills as he’ll be coming back after that.
AITA for being mad about this? Should I be more understanding and cincai to wait in the room for him lol? Please advise. Thank you!

Long story short, I brought a singing frozen princess and gave away the soft toy to some random neighbour in goodhood.sg (doing some good in the process and received some rescued bananas too!)
Now that the toys are given away, she has acted like it never happened. Pls advice if I need to bring her for some therapy as I’m very traumatised by this split personality. Sincerely thank u

Since we started to date, she felt that her life quality as dropped. She said she given up a lot of things for me and she been feeling quite mentally exhausted. She been wanting me to proposal to her and getting our marriage but i feel that currently, we're not ready yet. We've also been quarrelling for even small matters, she always think that she's in the right and i've been purposely finding faults to argue with her.
She always get angry for no reasons. That day her mum asked me to help her buy stuffs and since she said she tired from sch, so i picked her up and send her home first. But she get angry that i didn't told her that her mum asked me to help buy items and she felt that buying those stuffs unnecessary. She argue with me said that i don't bother telling her what's happening and then she throw mine items on the floor, take scissors cut the shirts that i owned. While picking those items she thrown on the floor, she been raising her voice until whole building could heard the arguments.
Sometimes she love to play ""cold wars"" with me for no reasons, suddenly block me for hours/days then don't want pick up any calls/messages. She allergies to crabs so when we eating, she insist of eating crabs but i said no. She angry and then walked/dump me there while we're dinning.
She also angry that i don't share salted eggs potato chips with her when i ordered like a bulk of it and she probably ate like 90% of it and i eat probably like half a packet. Saying how "" I don't love her anymore, don't cherish her anymore after we're dating"". She said how in her family, what she wants to eat n etc, ppl will always ask her, share with her and they don't snatch with her snacks to eat.
So one of the days, i requested her to walks the dog as i was busy with presentation and since for the past few days, it was raining so the dog didn't manage to be out of the house. She said i'm treating her like a maid, asking her to follow my order. She never touched dirty things in her life. for example, when the dog shits. i'm always the one picking up the poops. In her family, she ate alr just dump the plate/bowl at the sink/basin, for someone in her family to wash. She also don't tidy up her room, sweep floors and etc, was always me when i go her house to help her housekeeping her room.
She also have a bad habits of wasting money on unnecessary. She always like to go cinema to watch movies , probably like every week. But i'm the one paying for it since she doesn't have any income. She also rant that i am unlike other ppl bf, buy for their gf accessories.

59570,105013,"My partner is too nice. He is nice to me and also to everyone around him. He is someone that is easily convinced by anyone and easy to be taken advantage of. So at his workplace, coworkers especially female coworkers like to approach him for help and they like to make small requests like helping them to run errands, takeaway breakfast for them, driving them out for lunch when there are eating places at walkable distance and sometimes dropping them home since it is along the way etc.
I don’t want to be the bad person and ask him to stop helping people. As his girlfriend, my concern here is that he can’t say no and his female coworkers are taking advantage of that. Anyone can influence his opinions. I have tried talking through this with him and usually his reply will be like ""I don't see any issue in this"" and says that’s who he is. We will end up in small arguments because of this.
Due to these small arguments, he chose to ""help"" them out ""behind my back"" instead e.g. bringing them out for lunch or fetching them home and this makes me more annoyed because he don't get my point. I know that he is trying to save some petrol money too so we are meeting up lesser so that he can ""save"" up on his petrol money. Yet, he won't hesitate to bring his female coworkers out for lunch when they requested for it or he will drop them off to their houses directly after work dinner. All these requests are happening on a very frequent basis. He mentioned that he don't want to let me know because he wants to avoid these ""stupid"" arguments.
Also, I don't feel like he prioritizes me more than them. Make it clear first that I don't want him to stop being friends with them. I feel like being his girlfriend just being another one of his coworkers/friends because seems like whatever he is doing for his female coworkers are the same as towards me.
So is it wrong for me to feel annoyed? And to all the females, can you accept your partner being such a pushover/people-pleaser and also often putting his females coworkers/friends' needs first?

They are friendly and teach me stuff. However because most of the employees are not Singaporean, the work culture is quite different, even the way they treat Singaporeans is also different. They only care about their fellow countrymen, so if the team consists of people from different backgrounds, the team will not be bonded. It is quite obvious that they are only friendly with each other for work relations.
Recently a new full timer joined my team. He is also from that country. As such, he is treated extremely well. He was given a tour around the office and they even treated him lunch. Back when I joined, there was no such treatment lol. But I guess it is because I am a temporary staff there is no need to treat me that well. I am fine with that.
However, my supervisor has been assigning work that was meant for me, to him. Hence ever since he joined my workload has become significantly less and I don't learn as much anymore. I am also kept out of the loop for projects that I used to be part of, and he has replaced me. My supervisor even asked me to give him my script which I spent 1 entire month working on, so that he can take over my duties. Now I dread going to work because I want to be busy and learn things but now I cannot because everything has been passed to this new guy. Maybe my supervisor finds it easier to communicate with someone of similar background as her, so she stopped giving me important tasks and instead gave them to him.
It has come to the point where every day I have to ask for work because I have nothing to do. But the work assigned to me is extremely mundane. I miss the days before this new full timer joined. I really don't know how I am going to handle the next few months in this team.

59575,105020,"Sigh, it's so tiring being a female. I've always been a happy-go-lucky and bubbly kinda girl. And I'm always uncomfortable when girls around me like to compare everything and anything. In the beginning, it was the education level. I graduated from poly and had lower income than some friends. So even though some of them gave me the attitude that I'm ""lower"" than them, I don't mind because I'm not one who always want to win. I'm just comfortable in my own skin. Somehow, I got into another job where I earned probably x2 or x3 of their income. They actually didn't know(by chance) until few years later because I also didn't go around saying. It wasn't until one day they caught me driving my car then they asked about it. In fact...I was hiding the fact that I bought it...for fear they will (again) compare this and that. So this group of girls likes to compare education level, income, car, house etc.
Another group of girls is different. They don't compare about education and income because they don't have much. So they start to compare how many guys are wooing them and giving them attention. My motto is just go out drink and have fun. But they always have to compete by asking how many guys you know tonight etc. While I'm definitely UNABLE to be as initiative and passionate as them, I can't deny that the peer pressure had influenced me to be slightly friendlier to strangers who approached me(which I'm usually not). Then, for subsequent gatherings, every girl is supposed to bring guys(to drink together - I didn't do anything else). I was slowly brainwashed into this is normal. But it's not. The guys gave me so many problems when they get jealous over one another. Some tried to kiss me when they were drunk. Some girlfriends got into conflicts with me when they started to like my guy friends because my guy friends are much better looking than theirs.
It was so chaotic until 1 day I told myself I got to stop all this nonsense. So, I stopped bringing my guy friends to gatherings, lying that they can't make it. No matter how much the girls ridiculed me at not having any guy friends with me, I ignored them. To my shock, one of them liked my guy friend so much that she asked him to join without my knowledge. Things became awkward between me and him. My friends knew he liked me but I don't like him(It's not that I don't like him lah, I don't like his advances when he's drunk. He treats me pretty well when he's sober). So gradually they invited him to gatherings but excluded me so that it's easier to seduce him without me around. I suddenly realized how toxic this group is and I ditched them.
Years later, I got to know a bunch of really awesome girls who are totally not like that. They don't compare about this and that and values girls' friendship more than other shitty unimportant things. And I realized the similarities among them: They are happy and comfortable in their own skin, just like me, not competitive. Happy as in really happy with their married/attached/single status - Not the kind who are married/attached but unhappy OR single but so desperate to get laid those kind. They value friendship of us girls alot. Last but not least, they are more or less the same caliber as me. As in, we are pretty much equally well-liked - nobody gets left out. Everytime we go out, different guys will approach us. As in, it's very balanced. It's always so much fun with them. (For the previous group, it wasn't very balanced - I had too much attention than the others.
In short, girls....stick with happy people. Happy and uncompetitive people. With my vast experience with toxic females......the more competitive they are, the more toxic they are. And it has nothing to do with age. Some 30 years old, married already, still behave like petty teenagers, thinking they are starring the Mean Girls movie.

59590,105049,"To the OPs who have been posting regarding their relationship woes here... here's my story:
Used to date A for 5-6 years - firmly believed that ""as long as I put in the effort, we'd make it through and be happy""... I learnt that: if he wasn't nice to you at the start/ honeymoon stage, the likelihood of him changing his attitude towards you is close to zero. If you let him treat you like a doormat at the start, you'll be a doormat throughout the relationship. A would be expecting us to go dutch for every single meal, A would expect me to do HIS work for him, A would even go overseas with his ""girl friends"" because they were ""just friends"". When I finally realised my worth and tried to end things, A made all sorts of promises to treat me better... only to revert to his usual self again after a few months.
Started dating B 2-3 years ago. Having learnt from my past relationship, decided that I'm not gonna settle this time round - honestly think it's the best decision I've made. You can easily tell when you're a priority to someone. B offers to pay for almost every meal although I'm currently earning more (Just a disclaimer in case I get bashed: I pay for meals too????), B offers to send me home even if we were at an area nearer to his house, B never ignores my texts for hours on end unless he's asleep, B stood up for me when his friends (of many years) bad-mouthed me and (of his own will) decided not to meet them as often anymore.
So yea, my point really is: It is possible to find someone who treats you as his/her priority, please do not settle!!!

59567,105005,"Is it really that inconceivable for a man to want to be single for the rest of his life?
I have never dated. But the idea of my having to live a life to please another human being who doesn’t at the bare minimum pay me makes absolutely no sense to me.
I make a good living. I’m an Oxbridge-trained lawyer who is on track to becoming one of the youngest junior partners of my law firm’s history. I love my job. It’s highly interesting and I go to bed looking forward to the next day of work. I can’t say the same about the prospect of having another woman live in my condo. It fills me with dread to have to share my space with someone.
My older brother is a junior partner at a different law firm and his wife has just been a pain in his ass since they met. Doesn’t work, the maid looks after the kids, and she just buys ridiculously expensive stuff all the time. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him happy since he was married.
Since you get one try to be married to a person. Why would anyone nowadays take that gamble?

On the other hand, the cost of living and stress level even without a kid is insane. How to afford for the needs of a child and the commitment that comes. Seeing all the kind of societal pressures like sending kid for tuitions, classes etc just to try ensure they are in level playing field is so daunting. What benefit do parents gain from kids apart from having ""something to look forward to""? Lol

59591,105053,"About 2 years ago, I met this guy online (not gonna say where but it’s not a dating app, not Instagram either). After about a month of talking we decided to meet and we got along pretty well. However it got to the point that we were unsure of our feelings for each other and kinda became a situationship, yet we do things that couples do, initiated by him (holding hands and kissing, nth else).
Me being a girl I got caught feelings eventually to find out he did not feel the same way. I was very heartbroken (in Feb 2021) and wanted to cut off all contact with him however I could not bare to do so, so we continued to talk. However I realise that he takes v long to reply (like a day) but yet he can still be online thru out the day, which might mean he’s talking to other people… but yet he doesn’t wish to reply me, doesn’t wish to share the little details of his life with me even when I have already shared so much about myself to him. I can’t help but think “am I really that bad/uninteresting?”, which I’m very sure I’m not. I also realised from the start of this situationship that he might have depression, I’m not sure if he’s diagnosed with it or not, but I’m kinda sure it is. Since I don’t know much about him, whenever he’s feeling down I’d just comfort him thru text and sometimes irl.
Fast forward to the first day of this year, I decided to delete all our messages and move on, however there were just some instances that reminded me of him and I texted him again (just for the sake of catching up and wanting to know how is he). However, he’s still the same and recently, I removed him from my social media and vice versa, sent him a text on how I felt and blocked him. It was not easy but it’s just so mentally draining for me for these past 2 years.
I don’t need advice or whatsoever, but comments are welcome and I’d like to see people’s opinion on this :D

59585,105044,"It is already 2 months since our break up and I still can't get over. Yes the relationship duration was not long and merely over a year, but we had been so involved in each other lifestyle so much, telling each other almost every detailed lifestyle since day 1, that you are already part of my life, and I had already set my mindset to have you in every aspect of my life till this day.
A lot people have been telling me to let go or fk it as you are not worth. But probably cos of my love to you runs too deep, I could not, my heart is refusing to let the feeling goes off, and you keep running in my mind. I have been trying my best, avoiding places which we enjoyed and loved to go often, such as ShiLiFang, Saiseriya, Genki, even McDonald and more. The pain in me is excruciating till this day, and often, unknowingly I had made myself drive and go to the places we had been, checking out every claw machines I passed by for your favourite plushies as your love for them are deep and I would love to catch them all for you.
Even now, every night before sleep, I would still say 'Good night xxxxx, ilu', and when I wake up, first thing on my mind is you and saying 'Good Morning xxxxx, ilu'. We were still chatting normally and happily with each other till to the day you wanted a sudden break up. The only thing on my mind is probably you had been seeing another guy and he is much better than me in some aspects, but I just chose to believe you and hope that wasn't the case. You have since blocked me and I have not heard about you for nearly a month, but I just could not move on. It is just too hard for me although I have been trying...
There would be some negatives, flaming or judgmental comments coming, encouraging me to let go (appreciate for the encouragement), but putting yourself in my shoes, from a person who cherishes and values a lot on relationship, had put whole heartedly everything into the relationship, and ended 'abruptly'.
I did not cheat on her, neither was I financially unstable or neglecting her, instead I had been treating her as my priority and definitely not in possessive ways. Basically what girls' basic expectation of a boyfriend will do, I already did to my best. (Excluding buying luxuries branded stuff.)

59578,105026,"I am someone who would make time for my friends even thou I am married or busy with my kids. Like I would appreciate that short few hrs of catch-up with my friend cause I understand that everyone has their own life to be busy about right now, we just need to have a short one once in awhile.
So when I plan to do so, I would usually get help from my husband to take care of our kids so that I am able to head out during the weekends or weekdays after work to catch up with my friends.
I suggested to my 10+ yrs bff to have a short meetup on one of the weekend because it has been long since we catch up with each other. But she told me that her husband doesn't allow her to head out with friends on weekends because he was also not working on weekends. She also felt that it was unfair to her husband to let him take care of their kids while she head out to enjoy cause her husband does not do that to her.
Sometimes I just wonder that do we humans really need friends? Is it common to have friends that doesn't make time to catchup with you but still they are your so call best sister/friend? She only catch up with friends that are alright to also meet her husband together with her. Sometimes I just wanted some ""ladies"" time without husband and kids.

59589,105048,"To the OP of #105038, I am also currently facing the same issue as you. My gf of 3 years have a close male friend in the same school and when we were on a break because of an argument, that male friend came to snatch her away from me and she had to fulfill his weird requests before she could break up with him. But the worst thing is they are still friends and still hang out together. I just couldn't make her see that that guy is nothing but lies, says he have no friends but when they broke up, he is always hanging out with friends.
She never let me meet him because he doesn't like me and he has been looking through all my texts with gf even when we were together. That was the moment he tries to snatch her away, cb move. Like the points you find it sus, I am facing the exact same thing. My gut feeling tells me something is wrong too.
- Every time I meet her, that guy will always be texting her, telling her where is he, who he is with, and just chatting with her. There was once I am meeting her at Orchard and she told me that guy was supposed to be in Botanic Gardens but he ended up in Orchard and wanted her to go find him. How sus is this right? And yes when she is with me, she replies him immediately but when she is with me, she takes hours to reply me. She says she didn't want him to know that she is with me, for fear he will stop her from breaking up and become possessive and clingy. He waits at her house area most of the time because he thinks I will be aggressive to her.
- For his birthday earlier this month, she spent the whole day with him and he tries to make advances like kissing her cheeks and holding her hands, and she lets him do it out of fear, isn't this weird for just a friend?
- When I met her yesterday after her date with him, she wore very nice outfits, and she says that guy is better because I never bring her to such places before. But she doesn't know that I spend this 3 years helping with her with her mental well being and her relationship with her parents and on top of that I have to still juggle work and studies.
- She told me the love for me isn't back yet, and I did ask her if she wants to go back to him instead of me, since he plans great outing activities, she likes his tone (cuz i sounded angry when she tells me about that guy) but she says no, but her actions says otherwise.
All in all, I need someone to talk to, can the OP of #105038 be my friend? So we can rant to each other and who knows we might be right one for each other instead.
On a side note, if OP is ok to be friends, how do admin help ar? LOL

59573,105017,"Has anyone else experienced this? I'm your typical local guy (Chinese), tried asking several local girls out since secondary school till this year, but always got rejected. Recently I got to know an exchange student from a European country (white girl), and we've been dating for a few months. Since getting together with my girlfriend I've been experiencing a lot of negativity from my local female acquaintances. We weren't particularly close before and I was pretty much ignored, which is fine, because naturally you're not going to vibe with everyone. Suddenly, they seem very interested in my private life, and always seem incredulous that I'm dating a white girl. I've also got a lot of passive-aggressive comments along the lines of ""why don't you date a Singapore girl"", ""wah, very good ah, ang moh girlfriend"" (said with tonnes of sarcasm), ""wah, Chinese girl not good enough for you is it?"" All this is quite strange for me, because I was pretty much ignored and rejected my entire life, but now, everyone seems to pass judgement on my relationship. In contrast, no one bats an eyelid if it's a local girl dating a white guy. I'm not sure if this is normal behaviour, or if my social circle is just toxic. I just want to enjoy my time with my girlfriend without being disturbed. Is that too much to ask?

59581,105032,"My elderly divorced aunt is having an affair with a married man
Since my aunt (late 60s) divorced her husband 20 years ago, she has been having affairs with married men of similar age. All her past and current boyfriends share similarities like poor health, financially stingy, low income, or retirement.
After her previous married boyfriend died from a heart attack, she found a new one quickly. As for the new bf, he is retired and has a wife and will come over to sleep at my aunt's house some days each week.
The problem with this old man is that every time we go for dinner and family outings, my parents will have to pay for him and my aunt. He never once offered to pay for the meal, and when he previously visited my house during Chinese New Year, he would disrespect my family by smoking in the house. I told him before not to smoke, but in the subsequent year, he would secretly smoke on my balcony and throw the cigarette butt out the window without considering my neighbours' safety. I shouted at him to stop smoking at my house, and since then, he gave me an attitude for half a year; until last week, he spoke to me nicely.
My mother will have a large-scale birthday party soon, and I know he will tag along with my aunt for the free food and free flow of alcohol at my family's expense. Hence, I want to take this opportunity to settle this nonsense by expressing my true feelings to him and telling him to stay away from my family (aunt not included).
Please comment as much as you want, and any suggestions are welcome. Thanks.
