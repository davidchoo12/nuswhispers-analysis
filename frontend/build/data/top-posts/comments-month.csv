60782,107547,"When you break up with your rich gf to be with a pretty one and it ended up ruining your life.
My first gf was in nus. She comes from a rich family. I know exactly the type of guy she like so I became exactly that to get her. It was great when we're dating. She would surprise me with dates of staycations, fancy restaurants, movie nights. I would offer to pay but she would decline as she knows I'm still giving part time tuition to supplement my allowance as I'm also studying.
Tbh I'm not that into her but I kept it going as I really enjoyed the company and the lifestyle. I come from a humble background but have always aspired to make it big when I graduate.
Then this new girl entered my life. She's the hottest girl I've ever met irl. She also happen to be newly single and all the guys were swooning and wanting to get her attention. I was lucky enough to have common friends with her and got introduced.
Fate was on my side, my old gf had an argument with me and I used the chance to break up with her. I did my best to make it seem that it was coincidental. When I couldn't wait any longer I openly pursued the new girl.
I admit I was aggressive in chasing her as I knew she had other suitors. Things didn't work out as well as I thought once we are officially together.
We argued everyday. It was mostly because I suspect she was still talking to other guys. I can't help myself and would get angry when she has other guys around her when in school. Why can't she just hang out with the girls?! I hate her best guy friend who's known her since she was in secondary school. Why must they still keep in contact? Aren't I enough?
I bought a diamond ring for her to wear which she did but I still think it's not enough. We still argue everyday. I'm so bloody angry with her. Why can't she just not give me reasons to doubt her?!
I made so many arrangements with her. Set up bank account together with her. We leave personal belongings in each other's place. I mostly want her to leave her things at my place because it's easier for her to stay over at my place as her family are not nice.
I have lost count the number of times we argue, break up, I buy flowers to win her back. I admit I let my insecurity get the better of me sometimes. But it's her fault. She's too pretty and she did nothing to assure me that she won't cheat on me.
When she started her internship I knew she would stray one day and I was right. I caught her walking with a male colleague out of the office building. When I confronted her she told him to quickly leave. If they were platonic, why won't she introduce me?! She said I'm embarrassing her. I snatched her phone and left and she didn't even chase after me. Isn't this a sign of guilt?
She said its over so many times until I don't believe her anymore. I always am able to coax her back to me. But not anymore after this. I suspect she's seeing someone who works with her. That is the only explanation.
I destroyed everything of hers that she left at my place and she closed out the bank account that we shared and dared to tell me she was the only one putting money in so the money is all hers. What about the amount of money I spent on her?! That diamond ring isn't cheap! She had the cheek to change her numbers and even got her family to hang up on me. I made sure she remember everything that happened is her fault. She ruined me. I will never forgive her!
Pretty girls are over rated. She doesn't even have much money and yet acted like I'm the money greedy one. Wait till I earn 100k per annum, I'm sure she will regret leaving me!

60734,107434,"Hi there! I'm a 23yo female this year and I have recently started working after graduation in a pretty well paying job. Things are looking up for me and I also have a hunch that my boyfriend is going to propose soon because he has been probing me alot about ring preferences alot in the recent months. TBH he doesn't really have any red flags and has alot of green flags: he's kind, caring, family-oriented and gentlemanly. Sxx is also very good and it helps that we both have high libido. Career-wise he is also doing very well too. I genuinely do see a future with him and want to start a family with him.
HOWEVER theres just 1 thing... He is 10 years older than me and we've been dating for about 10 years as well. And if you did the math... Well yeah, I think you'd get it. It kinda was child grooming? I'll admit we starting having sex really early on into the relationship (less than a year) and we have been active throughout. We also haven't been using any protection but in his defence, it was a mutual decision.
Honestly I'm torn after doing some self-reflection.On one hand, i really love him and want to have a family. On the other I find it hard to come to peace with the past. I find it kinda messed up. I'm afraid that others will know about the past and whether it will affect my ability to be a good mother to my children. I would say yes in a heart beat if he asked me for marriage a few months ago but now I'm not sure. Please advice this troubled girl!

When you say you want to eat something, or watch a movie, I will purposely mention something else different that I want to eat or watch instead.

Sometimes I like to purposely disturb the guy and see what he do. If I insult you a bit and you dare to insult me back, or be insecure about it, especially if I try to tease things about your insecurity, then it means you are not manly enough. A manly man will not insult me back, and will not be insecure even if I try to disturb and hurt him. A manly man will show me that he can handle it and not be affected by me.

60786,107553,"My dad is a business owner, self made man. Growing up, he raised my younger sister and I to be capable and independent. My dad absolutely detest ""useless"" (acc to him) people and this translated into our upbringing. He has been scarred by useless children of his rich business associates. Long story short, only 2 points are applicable to this story.
1. He will cut us off financially when we turn 21.
We can still stay at home rent free, but nothing else. We don't have to give parents monthly allowance coz acc to him, the amount is peanuts and he would rather we use it to be independent. If we retain and did not graduate uni by 21, too bad, we will have to pay the remaining school fees on our own.
2. If we are not 100% independent by 30, he will write us out of the will.
Independent means having our own home (rented or bought doesn't matter) and having enough money to feed ourselves.
As a results, I worked by butt off growing up, I chose not to go to uni to work earlier and ended up studying part time for my degree. I studied a course that I did not like, but it's practical. I bto-ed with my husband and now, before 30, we have our own house, kid and pretty good life. I sacrificed, did what was smart rather than what I liked, during my early 20s while my friends were enjoying ""uni life"".
My younger sister will be graduating uni this year (graduated actually). She chose her course based on ""passion"" and now have difficulties finding a job. She enjoyed her uni life a bit too much and took on a study loan when she turned 21, and delayed her graduation a few times. Therefore, now she has no money, in debt and no job. There's no way she will be able to fulfil the independence criteria by the age of 30.
She went back to ask dad for financial help. Dad refused at first and then said he can help only if I approve, as I followed the rules. Changing the rules halfway will be an insult to the hard work and sacrifices I made.
Should I give my approval?
PS, I decided against it. People need to know the consequences of their actions, especially if this has been discussed since birth.

60787,107554,"How do you normally deal with those who look down on you?
We are a family of 3 and stay in HDB and do not own car. We are not into brandrd stuff as well. We live a simple life. We dont even have driving license because we dont think it is necessary yet as the public transport in SG is already very convenient and good.
However, we travel pretty often. We mostly travel during school holiday. In addition, like once or twice we will go to europe during school holidays.
This is the problem.
Some of our circle of friends often ask us this:
""How come you can go europe few times? Its not cheap right. How do you do it?""
""Eh why don't you buy the BTO in this place? This is very good but its pretty expensive though. Like 800k larrr..""
""Wah your job can earn that much meh till can go to europe?""
So this is the thing. Our household income exceeds the maximum BTO income ceiling. Its not we do not want to buy or cannot afford to buy. We are not eligible to buy BTO. But we cannot be telling them this as we feel it sounds too bragging.
We go to Europe every year is exactly because we stay in HDB and do not own cars/other expensive expenses. To be honest, we do not even have to spend a single cash for our HDB because our monthly morgage is paid off by my husband's monthly CPF. So the gross salary we receive every month is solely for our savings and monthly groceries/expenses. So it is safe to say, our most monthly expensive expense is only our HDB mortgage. Our only debt is our HDB. This is why we have some spare cash for our luxurious travel.
If they ask us once or twice in a while, i think its fine. But they ask us everytime they meet us, it is pretty bothering.
Is it just because you live in HDB, do not live in Condo do not own cars in SG snd not into branded stuff, you are considered ""poor""?

She told me that she stated in the contract and I signed it. The only solution to this problem is to buyout my notice period as they need someone to start soon. So I told HR that I will buyout.
I managed to pay my ex company using my own money…but I would like to claim from my current new company. How should I approach her in this kind of situation? I understand that it’s mostly my fault for not reading the contract properly but the buyout payment is a lot.

60759,107503,"Hello everyone. This is an Update from Post #105064.
I had written about my girlfriend's terminal illness and whether we should get married. I'm glad to say that we did manage to register our marriage, and even held a small reception with our closest family and friends. From her illness early stages, we try to create as many happy memories as we could, and did our best to fulfill as many of her bucket list wishes as time allowed. Unfortunately, we were unable to check off everything as she has passed on recently few days before her 24th birthday. Since then, I have been grieving and mourning. Her absence is too overwhelming for me and I find myself lost, unsure of how to proceed with my life now that my wife is no longer here. I really miss her so much. Waking up without her by my side, missing our shared daily activities, and no longer taking care of her has made me super empty and aimless. My closed ones keep comforting me telling me that my wife would not want me to be consumed by sadness and that I should try to move on but honestly, their advice is impossible. My Parents and Parents in law have been trying to console me but I refused to accept the reality. Because of this, I've found myself pushing them away. My wife's absence is really painful for me as we've been together since secondary school. I’m afraid that moving on will make me forget about her. Memories of her haunts me every day, and the thought of me forgetting about her has made me in denial. At this point, I can't even bear to look at her photos or her belongings without breaking down. Even writing this is really painful. I have seriously lost all motivations in my life and I'm struggling to cope with the events that has happened. I feel like grieving and mourning will be my new normal activity. I just don’t feel like doing anything anymore. Life is so unfair to me.
I thought that writing in this space can help me to release some suppressed emotions, and perhaps those who have gone through similar experiences could offer some guidance or support.
Thank you for reading this.

60739,107457,"I wanna ask other ladies for their opinion.
It was my birthday last week my boyfriend of 2yrs told me he would cook a 3 course dinner for us. I was actually really excited and thought it was romantic of him to do it. So on the day itself he asked me to go hangout with my friends so he can stay home and prepare the food and stuff right. Fast forward to dinner time he sat me down and told me not to come into the kitchen cause he wants to surprise me then poured me a glass of wine while he prepared the appetiser. Then the main course and dessert. Food was good and i felt really happy. I cant explain the feeling lah but its not the same as eating in a restaurant.
Anyway after dinner he was cleaning up quickly threw the trash and we sat down to watch a movie. I was thirsty and went to the kitchen to get a drink and guess what i found on the floor beside the trash can. A receipt from a restaurant with the food i just had for dinner! This means he didn’t actually cook it. He bought it and told me he made it. Now it makes sense why he didn’t want me in the kitchen or the house. He went out to buy the food and just reheated in a pan on the stove. My heart sank. Not because he didnt cook the food but because he lied saying he did. Why did he have to lie about this? I’m actually really sad that he wasn’t honest with me. He didn’t have to pretend he made it. I get it maybe he was trying to impress me but hello? Im already his gf he doesn’t have to impress me anymore. If he made me spaghetti and meatballs i would have been very happy that he took the time to make something for me already. I don’t understand why he had to lie. He doesn’t know i found the receipt too. I just feel really cheated and lied to. How am I supposed to trust someone who would lie about these kinds of things? How should i confront him?

She'll be doomscrolling TikTok the entire day, frequently sending me videos of influencers showing off their branded goods, having fun at holiday locations, etc and asking me when I will bring her there. Bitch please, I just left my cushy corporate job to start my own business, ain't nobody got time for that shit.
She was getting really annoying so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I decided to start influencing her social media feed. I used her laptop and to google for sports, crypto news, AI news, etc, stuff that I know she won't be interested in, searched for similar stuff on TikTok and started liking and following content creators she won't be interested in.
At first I thought it didn't work, but after a week I realized she wasn’t using TikTok that much and I asked her why. She complained that her feed was really boring and nothing she saw interested her. It was WORKING!
I decided to take things a step further by making her see stuff she's moderately interested in, yet is useful so that they'll slowly influence her lifestyle. She has gained a bit of weight since our wedding but she’s too lazy to start exercising, so I started using her account to follow some fitness and health influencers.
Guess what, a week later she dragged me to sign up for a gym membership together and booked some yoga classes. I’m pretty fit myself so I don’t really need that but I’m happy to see that she's doing something about her health. It has been a few months and she looks much healthier. I'm super happy with the results of my ""social media influencing"".

Only downside is that she has a princess temper at times but I think it's just her way of power play as I know she's falling for me and fear that I don't feel the same about her.
Girl B is also a nice girl. Very simple minded, eager to please me and always agreeable. I think she's mild tempered or she doesn't feel comfortable voicing out.

6. The ones who have a strict height preference. Bios include things like ""If you are shorter than 180cm pls swipe left"", or ""Where my 6ft guys at? hehe"", or ""I'm tall so I need someone taller than me, swipe right if you are"".
7. The ""basic girls"". Includes things like, ""cafe hopping enthusiast"", ""I'm a foodie so I love food!"", ""introverted extrovert"", ""ENTP"", ""aries"", ""love to travel!"", ""shy at first but crazy once you know me"", ""just here to make friends only"", ""I'm shy so you should make the first move"", ""love watching dramas"".
8. The ""looking for security"" girls, but don't really care as much about getting to know you. These girls usually are trying to fish out what educational level you have, what uni you are from, what job or job field you are in. And these are usually done in a way that you can tell they prioritize these, over getting to know what you are like (they may ask this within the first 2-3 exchanges of messages once matched, instead of asking things like your hobbies and interests first). If your answers to their questions are not something that reflects that you can earn a good amount of money, they show quick signs of losing interest to carry the conversation further.
9. The boring girls. Bios are usually short and boring. Their replies lack effort and substance, even if they write on their bios that they ""love deep conversations"".

60774,107530,"TLDR; i broke up with my girlfriend because of our differences in love languages. Am i wrong?
For context, she is 3 years older than me , working a job that has time flexibility whereas Im serving the nation, but headed towards university this coming intake.
We do love each other still, I do love her, i really do. But we always argue on how often I am spending time with her. I am pretty busy: with my own bills i need to pay, and I am someone who enjoys personal time, serving the country wtv,. To her, spending time = i love you, (quality time lover) but for me as long as she reassures me and makes me feel secure = i love you. (Words of affirmation). We have argued multiple times on how often i should be seeing her on a weekly basis, we tried to compromise 3 times and after everything it still doesnt work out, its like im not even enough for her. On some days she can tell me things like “you know, i feel very distant from you, i dont feel love from you at all” . - thats when i feel helpless, I already hardly spend time alone, something i value alot, and if she’s busy im spending time with my friends. Maybe its a skill issue on balancing things but she does stay quite far (east)and i stay west. Which overtime became wuite taxing to find her, furthermore she doesnt drive so it would be easier for me to go down to find her. And usually we hang out till late where public transport is not an option at all, and it would be easier and cheaper for me to go down to her.
I eventually broke up with her while i still love her. My reason was being that we don't perceive love the way we want it to be, i could be reassuring her and giving her words of affirmation but its not as well received as she just wants to spend time, something i don’t have at this point in my life. And furthermore, we discussed on me entering university. She said that no matter how much I reassure her, she will still feel insecure and I did discuss on potential problems and solutions as well, but we cant seem to come up with solutions. Long story short, the way she feels love is different from how I show her love. Dont get me wrong, i still love her and really want to be with her, but I strongly feel like she deserves someone who can give her what she NEED. We just cant seem to be on the same page on this. Hence I broke up with her as I felt like we are in different phases in our lives and I cant give her what she needs, and love language isnt something that can be changed like that, it is a personality nonetheless.
I feel like Im doing the right thing by letting her go, and I didnt cut her off immediately, I am still talking to her and try to rationalise why I broke up with her , she still don’t seem to get why… and im trying to help her, or at least i think i am. I don’t want to cut her off because i do still care and love her, and I want her to take this break up easier, if that makes sense, where i can just be her support if needed . Which is why im conflicted, am i helping her or killing her. I did mention to her that im doing this not to give her false hope, and im just there for support in the time being. I dont know how to handle this. I have never broken up with someone i still do love. What should i do? Am i doing the right thing? Im lost, help.

She has made several suggestive ideas of where we won't get caught but I really prefer that we keep things private so I've not agreed to this idea.
There was once we went to this social event, after a few drinks she pulled me to the toilet and tried to.... I was worried about being caught and I'm just not comfortable so I told her I'll surprise her another time when I have actually no idea how to help her realise her fantasy legally.
Is this a red flag? Should I be worried about her level of energy?

Recently there was an intern who joined us two months ago only. First time working and no experience.
I’ve heard around he’s been demanding to earn the same pay scale as us ($5k-$6k) and It’s very ridiculous because 1, during the two months he has been with us, he has done nothing and I’ve seen him go for multiple few hours tea breaks. 2, He has no foundation knowledge in the cloud service provider.
I myself have worked my ass up since I was 17 working as an intern ($600), With my first full time paying job at $1800. Now it took me almost 6 years of hard work to get to a paying job of $6k.
Seriously, Youngsters need to know company will NOT consider you just because you have a elite UNI Degree Certificate but will pay u hefty for your work experiences! So don’t get your hopes up of earning $5k straight out of uni.
As per my knowledge and experiences, the average starting pay with NO experiences and UNI cert is about 3k-3.5k.

60747,107475,"Hi there! I'm a 23yo male this year and I have recently started working after graduation in a pretty well paying job. Things are looking up for me and I also have a hunch that my girlfriend is going to propose soon because she has been probing me alot about ring preferences alot in the recent months. TBH she doesn't really have any red flags and has alot of green flags: she's kind, caring, family-oriented and motherly. Sxx is also very good and it helps that we both have high libido. Career-wise she is also doing very well too. I genuinely do see a future with her and want to start a family with her
.
HOWEVER theres just 1 thing... she is 10 years older than me and we've been dating for about 10 years as well. And if you did the math... Well yeah, I think you'd get it. It kinda was child grooming? I'll admit we starting having sex really early on into the relationship (less than a year) and we have been active throughout. We also haven't been using any protection but in her defence, it was a mutual decision.
Honestly I'm torn after doing some self-reflection.On one hand, i really love her and want to have a family. On the other I find it hard to come to peace with the past. I find it kinda messed up. I'm afraid that others will know about the past and whether it will affect my ability to be a good father to my children. I would say yes in a heart beat if she asked me for marriage a few months ago but now I'm not sure. Please advise this troubled boy!

60744,107467,"When a girl says that the guy has to earn similar or more than her, it is such a turn off. These are the kind of girls who would leave you when things get tough for you, or when you fail to meet her financial expectation of you, or if you decide that you find more fulfilment in a job that pays lesser than the one you had before (where instead of being happy for you, she leaves because you now earn less). Never mind the fact that you are loyal and loving to her, but because she already values you with a significant weightage based off what you can offer financially, why would she care?
I'm not stingy and would also want to spoil my future partner too, but I also do not want to be with a girl who is with me because of my earning power, or my potential earning power. This is not just a gold-digger thing, it applies to women who are ""not gold-diggers"", but have these kind of ""he has to be willing to pay more"", ""he has to earn more than me"" kind of mentality. It is not like women cannot earn money for themselves, so why the need for this kind of mentality? Why do you feel entitled to his money?
If a guy earns $100 a month because he is irresponsible and does not want to work much, then sure, that is valid, and is also unattractive to guys when girls are like that. But if he's an upright man who is responsible and works for an honest living, treats you well and has good values, but yet you want to leave him because he earns less than what you personally want from a man, then you're a huge red flag. Guy should avoid you.
And things like ""he may earn less than me now but he must be driven and ambitious, so next time he can earn more to hit my expectations"", are also red flags. Are you with him because you like him for who he is, or are you with him under the condition that he has to earn more in future?
Money is important, but how much do you value money over the value of the person that you are with that you claim to love and care for? Do you stick through thick and thin, or do you lack loyalty and would leave him for someone who earns more?
Same for guys, if a guy says the girl has to earn similar or more than him and stuff like that in order for him to stay with her, it is also a red flag. No double standards here.

He doesnt show me the physical affection he used to show me when we were dating. He used to hug and kiss me spontaneously, now I have to ask for a hug and a kiss, and the kiss is just a quick peck on the lips or cheek.
I'm currently in my 3rd trimester awaiting the baby's arrival and I know very well that once the baby arrives, the intimacy, the love, the affection will disappear entirely. I feel lost, unloved, and dont know what to do. I have asked him before about the lack of intimacy or affection after marriage and he said he is tired after work, which would be understandable, but he now has an assistant to help him with his workload at work as compared to not having an assistant and having to do all the work himself when we were still dating. Maybe he is no longer sexually attracted to me anymore because of my huge pregnant belly? I honestly dont know.
I also feel like there is a wall between us. He is always using his phone to surf fb when we are in bed and we barely talk. I feel really unprepared for my baby's arrival and I dont know whether he feels that way. He doesn't even research on anything baby related to prepare for the baby's arrival. I am always the one suggesting to go to baby fairs, courses, webinar, brainstorming what to get for the baby. I feel so unloved and neglected and I have no one to talk to about this situation I am in.

60749,107477,"Is there a stigma against being an heir of a large-ish family business in Singapore?
My father founded a construction firm that gradually pivoted into real estate investments over a 30-year career. He has two children, my older brother and me. My older brother is highly educated and substantially older than I am. He went to the best IP school, then he attended Princeton for undergrad and has an MBA from Columbia. I was sent to Australia after doing badly for O-levels and I graduated with an accounting degree from Monash. My father is sort of old school. Because I'm a girl and the younger sibling, he doesn't believe that I should have anything to do with the business. After many an argument with him, I resigned to it as the way life just is. My dad has never refused money whenever I have asked for it. He never skimped on my education. More importantly, my brother treats me very well. He always pays for everything whenever I go out with him. He also contributed to my husband's student loans when my dad stood his ground and refused to help. I reasoned with myself that I already received far more than I should have had given my dad's culture.
My father got into some health issues recently and his greatest wish is for my brother to take over the family business. My brother, now working in New York City, refuses to grant him his wish. The only reason that I have ever heard from him is the fact that he doesn't want to be perceived as someone who inherited a fortune and did nothing to deserve it. The AUM of my father's company, just for context, is well into the high 8-figures (this was a pre-Covid estimate). To me, it seems natural for a child to take over his parent's business. It may not have squared with me that it had to be the first male child, but I never saw anything wrong with having a child for an heir. I attended a swanky foundation studies program in Melbourne and I have met many Singaporeans and Malaysians who are in-line to take over massive family businesses. If I had a successful business, my instinct is also to pass it on to the people I trust the most, in all likelihood it will be my children.
I really can't be bothered what my brother decides to do. I just think his reason for doing it is a little puzzling. Is there really a stigma in Singapore against children taking over family businesses? I see children taking over hawker stalls all the time. I also see children taking over wet market stalls, children taking over frozen seafood businesses, air-con service businesses, distributorships, and these are just the ones I know personally. It shouldn't be that big of a deal to take over a business that someone genuinely wants to give you should it?
What do you guys think?

60761,107511,"When people say that being short is not a problem, I feel that it is a dogwater statement.
First, closely scrutinize your own surrounding. In your workplace, how many of your higher-ups are actually short? If you ever see a short one, I bet that this guy had put in extra effort than the rest to get to where he is. The rest are just playing the corporate game on an easy mode. Also, what can be worse than being vertically challenged and bullied verbally by a taller boss? How many of you can actually stomach that?
Second, observe social media and the showbiz industry. Do guys of height (~170cm) form the norm, other than a few outliers such as Tom Cruise? Absolutely not.
Third, look at all those male insurance agents and survey personnels approaching you on the street. How many of them are not above 6 feet? Obviously this cannot be a coincidence. They are carefully chosen because they look good parading their own height and marketing the products at the same time.
Fortunately it is not too late. Short guys may be deprived of many opportunities but there is at least one thing that can be done. To all the short kings out there, get the highest education qualification and work hard. Not many people in the world have the ability to reach that level. You can avoid the situation of being bossed around in future with a good quality degree.

I use real Chanels and Gucci.and what nots. I get this is hard to copy but she got similar quilted bags without logos that look like imitation. I worry people will think that I also carry fake bags. I dread the day we ever got caught wearing the exact same combination. I don't want to look like a fool together with her!

Instead, they make us do many-many design projects, like keep playing Lego only. Also, why our course so long one? Got extra year but no extra skill. What for we give them more money and waste our time? No point the school, likes to use NUS brand and say its a top school.
Really scam all the way. scam the parents, scam the public.

They just want to sit in the ivory tower, act blur, and enjoy the 'college good old days' forever and ever. Then, the big shots in the school just extend the course, because they think got professional feeling.
Another thing is, they keep selling us dreams. But when we finally graduate and step into the real world, then we kena shock. Suddenly, everything different from what we learn in school. Then we work like dog, but the pay peanuts. How to pay back student loans or make a living, and settle down?
Also got some seniors, say their employers think their education useless one. They spend five years studying architecture, but still kena call ""worthless"" in their own field. Simi sai is this?

60740,107459,"Is it really so hard to send a text to tell someone that you are not interested? Why do people choose to ghost the other person when it comes to dating?
While there are decent girls out there who are respectful enough to let me know that they are not interested to meet again after I ask them out again, these girls are few in proportion to the ones who would just ghost. And to make things worse (and I've experienced this a number of times before), a good proportion of these girls who ghost, would not just ghost, but they would agree to meet again first (after meeting initially), and then say that they need to check their schedule and that they would get back to me, and then never gets back to me.
It is obvious that there is a decent chance that the girls who did this, were already aware they didn't want to meet again, but chose to lead the guy on by agreeing to meet, and then ghosting afterwards (Usually they would have a more open schedule before, but then ""suddenly"" they have to check their schedule etc.). Perhaps because of their selfish reasons of not wanting to face the discomfort of rejecting someone directly, so they chose to lead someone on like that, or to simply ghost.
Even if you initially truly wanted to meet when you agreed to it, but then changed your mind after, shouldn't you at least have the decency to let the other person know, instead of carrying on the facade of wanting to put in your part of the effort to make the next meetup happen? And then eventually ghosting?
There was one who agreed to meet again (after meeting a few times), but then when trying to set up the time for it, she would always have some kind of reason why she has to delay or reschedule it or any of the like (whereas for previous meetups, she was much more able to find time to meet). And this carried on for some time until I eventually got so turned off by her character, I decided not to see her again.
Some people may say ""Omg just take the hint already she doesn't want to meet you again!"". But how hard is it to communicate that directly, instead of playing around with the guy like this? Am I suppose to assume that every girl who agrees to meet, is basically lying from now on? Am I suppose to assume that every reason a girl gives for needing to reschedule, or for being busy with school/work/whatever, is basically a lie from now on? What if she genuinely wants to meet but is really busy? See what I mean? Clearly, communicating directly that you do not want to meet (again), is the most effective and mature/respectful way.
If guys have to guess around and assume that your ""yes means no, and no means yes"", and do guesswork with your hints, then how do you expect anyone to take your words seriously and be able to trust your words?
On top of that, why can't the girl just send a simple text, ""Sorry but I don't think I want to meet again. I think we're not compatible, I enjoyed the time together with you though!"", instead of falsely agreeing to meet just to ghost, lying that you would get back to the guy when you know you're just using it as a means to reject him in an asshole-ish way on your part.
I've learnt that some girls do these lying and ghosting acts because there are guys out there who would go crazy and insult the girl after the girl respectfully says no (due to the guys' huge ego unable to accept rejection), or there could be guys who may do even more crazy things, and this is why some girls do not give a direct rejection, but rather choose to lie and ghost. If the guy showed signs of being a crazy creepy person I get it, it is probably for your safety to ghost.
But what about the majority of guys (I would like to believe it's the majority, correct me if I'm wrong) out there who are actually decent human beings, and showed no signs of being some crazy person (the meetups were fun, or even if not fun, at least it was a normal one)? Do they deserve to get dicked around by a girl like this? Couldn't you at least reject someone directly and respectfully, then if the guy turns out to start insulting you afterwards, you block him?
If a girl rejects me directly, I can at least respectfully acknowledge it, wish her well, and move on. It saves us both time, and allows the rejected person to move on without being led on.
For the decent girls out there who are shocked by this, yes, girls like this exists out there. I'm sure that many guys experienced this at some point in their lives before too. Also, I'm not saying that only girls are capable of being assholes by leading people on and ghosting like this, I'm sure there are asshole guys out there too. But as a guy myself, it is far from uncommon to come across girls like this. And the girls who do this are also not what you may be picturing in your head, you may think that these must be some girls who carry themselves without much respect for others, who carry themselves wildly and behave obnoxiously. But no, from my experience, the type of girls who do this are as common as the common girl you see in Singapore.

seriously in my free time while serving NS. I have a slight suspicion that my international writing pieces and awards carried me. It was a hobby so it didn't feel like a slog despite the massive workload, along with A levels.
So, should I go to Oxford for a humanities course or should I enter NUS on scholarship for mass-comm-ish course (sph scholarship). Financially, kinda broke. Going to have to take a bank loan if I decide to go to Oxford (and it's a dream school).
Pardon my writing, my helmet is rotting my brain. Unluckily, didn't get selected to write for the SAF in a cubicle. Upside is that I'm living my National Geographic dreams in the outfield. I've been looking at spiders, centipedes and sleeping with ants crawling on my body while I amidst the trees.

The most impt to be able to afford quality housing is ur salary. For pte housing, we try to aim for 8k starting pay at graduation as this will max out ur cpf oa contribution which u can pour into ur House
By 3 years into your job, your pay shld be 12k.
Don't buy a car. Please. Take mrt and bus. Adult Concession is just $128 per mth. Treat pte hire rides as a sin.
If you want a nice house early, DO NOT transfer to SA. Transferring to SA will cause issues with downpayment of 25%. Don't believe in those 1M65 idiots.
Transferring to SA is stupid coz if u can max out your cpf ceiling of 102k per year from age of 27, you will hit frs even without transferring.
You are permitted to eat avocados.Unlimited amount. I personally eat 4 daily. Quite cheap ntuc sell 4 for $6.95. And quite filling.
Keep your daily expense to less than $20 excluding avocadoes. Use sim only. Don't change phone too frequently. Cancel unnecessary Netflix Disney subscriptions. Don't give parents too much money. Under report ur income to them. Just max two credit card and pay ur credit card fully each month. Too much credit card affects the loan u can get next time. Don't buy too much new clothes, make up, accessories. Limit ur insurance spending by buying the correct things. Buy term insurance. Critical illness can opt out. But full hospitalization insurance is a must. Cancel gym. Go use the public fitness corner.
If u do the above, you shld be able to gather cash + oa of 600,000 by age 30 to 31 if girl and 32 to 33 if guy. Then u pour it into your downpayment and stamp duty for the first 2 bedroom rcr new lauch or 3 bedroom ocr new launch.
Tldr: avocado is not the problem. The problem is not earning enough and spending too much money.

1. Prepare for interviews like how you prepare for exams. I learnt this the hard way. I thought interviews were suppose to measure how good you are at doing your job, but it really doesn't.
2. Ask for pay raise after your probation. If you are good at what you do, and better than everyone else, ask your boss for a senior/management salary. Bosses are usually not dumb, and will reward you accordingly.
3. Network well with your senior colleagues, the talented ones. Your colleague can become an executive of a unicorn, you can parachute your way there too if your relationship with them is a good one. But don't waste too much time with people from HR, Marketing and other fluff departments, most people in these departments are gonna be completely replaced by AI soon.
4. Start side hustles. Tuition, small business & more. This tiny income streams can really snowball to a huge sum down the road.
5. Invest most of your income. Don't keep your money rotting in bank. At least put it in cash funds, and have a sound investment plan, let AI handle it if you suck at managing finances.
6. Spend time with your family. Not your new bf/gf, but your parents & siblings. For the most of you, your parents are no longer going to be around when you finally have the time.
7. Spend less time here and on other social media platforms. And with that, you would have extra time for yourself. Nobody really cares about your daily life that you share, apart from the ones that you meet regularly.

It took me months, and it's been more than half a year since then, but I'm now completely over you. So for the love of god, get the fuck away from me. Lose my number. Idk if you got dumped by her or what but I did not appreciate you messaging me out of the blue. Seeing your number popped up on my notifications gave me immense anger.

60722,107413,"Hi all, advice needed. So sorry for the long post ahead.
My mom and me have always been very close so I have always talked to her about my day since she always ask about it. So my typical topic of discussion with her is usually about life, school, personal relationships and work etc. Ever since she married my dad 40 years ago, she quite frequently got verbally abused by my dad due to his bad temper so she'll rant to me about it too. The only reason she stayed with my dad was because he provided well for the family.
However, recently I had been seeing some changes in my mom. When I have a topic of discussion with her, it started with her sometimes getting irritated with me within 15 minutes if she isn't in a good mood. Within a span of a year, this had worsened to her everyday getting irritated when I'm discussing topics halfway by at most the 10 minutes mark. Ok, i admit I have an inquisitive nature so I tend to ask a lot of questions during discussions, but this had never been an issue with my mom for the past 20 plus years of my life until only recently. When I asked her why, she said recently she felt physically and mentally tired, and she have no interest to talk for too long even to her siblings. Since she's tired, I suggested talking another day but she refused.
On top of this, her language had became a lot more vulgar when she used to avoid using vulagarities in the past. And her language had became a lot more extreme. When I complained about certain people at work, I was only looking for advice to solve the problem but she would suddenly use extreme language and said ""YOU WANT ME TO TAKE A KNIFE AND STAB THROUGH HER CB???"" Basically, she is no longer the mild-tempered person I once knew.
It had also became more frequent that sometimes when I asked her something, she looked like she completely zoned out so she don't reply me, or she would answer me a totally different thing so it made me wonder if she's listening or she don't understand my questions.
She is also starting to say things which makes no sense. When male colleagues talked to me and its just about work, she immediately suggested that maybe they're interested in me. I know it's definitely not the case so I tried to correct her thinking and she got irritated at me. She also said nonsense like if only I have a husband, nasty colleagues wouldn't have targeted me at work.
Lastly, I noticed she seems to have become more forgetful. The most recent incident was she told me to retrieve an item from the left cupboard but I couldn't find it. She said she told me to put in the left cupboard but I insisted my stand that I was not the one who kept it. Then she got irritated at me again and said ""NEXT TIME THINGS YOU KEEP LAH!!"" She looked for the item and it turned out to be on the right side cupboard and she's actually the one who kept it, not me. I mean if she forgot and I was only repeating my stand that I really didn't keep the item, why the need to get irritated at me? :( I don't even dare to bring up this point about her being forgetful recently, because I know she'll get defensive and retort ""MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU HAVEN'T REACH MY AGE AND YOU'LL BE WORSE THAN ME!!""
In summary, my mom seems to have become an easily irritable person. If it helps, she's currently in her early 70s and she have hypertension which is well-controlled by medicine.
Are the above problems caused by a much shorter attention span due to her age? And is her behavior listed above just a normal part of aging and a simple matter of her being tired, or is there something more I need to be concerned about? Sadly, I couldn't bring up about seeking professional help because I know she'll get very defensive.
Thank you for reading and would appreciate any advice given.

I find at times, men with the biggest ego are usually the short ones. Especially those who managed to get a managerial role. I don't have an issue with the height. But you can't deny they sort of scream insecurity when they act like a jerk when there's no reason to.
There's no way I'll even consider dating an egotistic guy no matter his height. I've met enough guys to know egoistic guys comes in all sizes. But when a short guy is angry with the world, it likely has got something to with how he thinks of himself, especially his height. Then the issue is not the world or other women but himself.
Lucky I'm a female and considered tall at 1.7m. Don't wish that I'm shorter in hopes that I'll consider you. Be a better human being if you want to attract any woman, regardless of her height. If you're a great catch, I'll even ditch my heels for you haaa.

60776,107532,"Hi, im a guy who graduated 3-4 years ago and im really looking for some career advice here and hopefully someone could chime in on working in the public sector. Would really appreciate the advice and if you are too shy maybe could you reply in another confession post. I got a job offer but i am wondering whether to take it, here are my considerarions. Hope you guys could list down any other things to think about! Which would you take? What questions would you ask job B? If you resigned from job A how do you tell the boss why you want to quit?
Myself:
-Engineering degree
-FCH grades and had scholarship from uni
-Good at writing and presenting
-Good at numbers but prefers talking to others
-Singaporean guy
Job A:
-Been here 3 years since i graduated
-Large global MNC, huge international projects, opportunities for overseas assignments to offices in every continent
-Very good networking, smart colleagues, international office very few singaporeans
-Heavy workload but decent work life balance, good medical coverage and dental, fun office perks, parties and sports ccas like badminton/soccer. Nice colleagues,good friendships. Flexible hours, dont need MC if sick, can take leave quite easily, just finish your work dont need to turn up on time. Paid overtime (sometimes)
- Minimal office politics, not being micromanaged (means i need to take initiative for everything)
-Good learning for technical skills
-Low start pay below market below market avg, unlikely to improve as company is looking to outsource work to lower cost offices (vietnam/jakarta), annual increments about 5%. 8% considered very good. Negligible increment despite promotions. After 6 years people typically dont cross $5.5k even with a masters degree from NUS/NTU. Freshers who join Job B sometimes make more than me despite my experience.
- Senior management not making financial savvy business decisions, too focused on brand image, CSR, and internal networking. Spending money on perks instead of salaries
-High turnover amongst Singaporeans due to low pay, hence the company hires mid to senior staff from overseas. They are good workers and a lot less picky about pay, making it hard for me to ask for more money.
-Boss thinks highly of me, but unlikely that translates to significantly higher compensation due to company policy
Job B
- Government job in a stat board
- 20~30% increment from current role. (i need $ to buy a resale hdb, cannot wait for bto alr)
- Stability and protection from foreign competition as work cannot be outsourced
- Heard rumours about public sector having too much red tape, is this true?
- Afraid of not learning any new skills and being unable to switch out of public service if i dont like it. Afraid of being a paper pusher until i retire
- no opportunity for overseas posting. Ive always dreamed about working or living overseas for awhile, even for a short while. Just for exposure.Maybe it is a dream worth giving up on? Or there are other avenues?
- im not on the ""gov scholar track"" although i have decent grades and CCA records. Will i be discriminated against? Not that i think that good grades always translate to good work output but since i have the grades i hope to use it to increase my pay/CEP?
- what is the annual increment? Does it beat inflation?
- what if i stay at job A and jump to job B later in my career? Will that give me more pay?

I just have some thoughts about the future and hope to gain some advice. Currently left 2yrs of uni and as an only child (F) with parents age in the 60s range, i cant seem to stop thinking what will happen in the near future. I am very fortunate that my parents have planned out their retirements and are financially independent to be prepared for their old age.
However, it seems far-fetched but i cant seem to be able to understand how i am going to be carry out my duties as their only daughter when one of them passes. In recent years i could see how their health is deteriorating, despite their healthy lifestyle and along with my grandparents passing on, just the thought of one of them not being present is really terrifying and i don't think I will ever be ready to be emotionally supporting either of them. How does typical praying rituals goes, how will we proceed on in our life, all these concerns seems to be really distant but yet it always lingers whenever i see an elderly, funeral proceedings, even a child. I just can seem to get these thoughts away or to feel reassured. Do i go and see a therapist? Talk to my parents? Friends? I have no idea and it does seems unfilial to carry out conversations and thoughts like this when my parents are clearly still present.
I would like to apologise in advance to those whom lost their loved ones way earlier in life and i hope that what i have mentioned does not too sound to condescending, it is truly not my intention.

60745,107470,"Do you think men or women care more about looks? In actuality, while society tends to say that men care more about looks, it is maybe not the case, and also could be because women just get away with wanting physical and superficial attributes more than men do, where men could get criticized for having standards.
When you ask a man what height would he be okay with, many men wouldn't even care if the woman is taller than him, even though, yes it does play a part in how much the man would be attracted to her, but a man tends to be more accepting of a taller women than a woman is towards a shorter man.
When you ask a woman what height would she be okay with, women tend to more likely be not acceptable of a man who is shorter than her, even if the man is just 1cm shorter. They may say ""as long as he is taller than me I'm okay"". But sometimes if you ask further, it turns out that it meant more like ""as long as he is taller than me, and is at least 165-170cm"", even though the girl herself is just 150-155cm tall.
When physique is in question, men seem to love a variety of body types, thin, chubby, curvy, fit, and more. As long as she is not underweight or overweight (which wouldn't be as healthy too), then can la acceptable to the man, still hot.
But when it comes to women, if you as the man do not exercise much, and neither does she, but she is on the upper end of the scale (though not overweight yet), and you are on the lower end of the scale (though not underweight yet) for your respective heights, she could be heavier than you simply because she has more fats, while you on the other hand with an asian man build, do not put on much fats naturally. But yet, while you think she is hot and not affected by her being heavier than you, she may wish you would exercise more and put on more muscle so that you can be heavier than her, even though she herself don't even exercise much, and she is the one who is on the heavier side respective to her own height, and you are not even at an unhealthy weight yourself too.
Furthermore, while both men and women tend to value the important personality and character values and traits, women still want other superficial things such as the man needing to have similar educational levels, what is his salary like, can he afford a nice car, will he buy an expensive wedding ring for her.
While men on the other hand don't even care as much if you as the woman earn less, works as pizzahut cashier, or if the woman has lower educational levels.
I think women seem to be the more superficial one overall, when compared to men. What do you guys think? This is just a part of my view and of course what I say does not represent all men and women, feel free to share your thoughts!

60785,107552,"You and your partner are surface-level compatible. You both have a similar sense of humour, like to hang out at similar places, similar interests/music taste etc. It is easy conversing about daily life with your partner, and you both are comfortable with silence together.
However, you know deep inside, you are not completely compatible. Your emotional levels are very different. You often feel alone when you have plenty of things to say/express, because you know your partner will not understand/is not able to feel the same way. Your partner is just unable to feel as strongly as you do, and you know you can never get your partner to express anything strongly, basically you feel stuck in a lukewarm relationship. Your partner can understand the situation, but they do not feel the intensity of it.
This lack of emotion from your partner also affects their general drive in life. As they are unable to feel for anything that strongly, they do not feel motivated to want more in life. Just the bare minimum is okay, e.g having a job is enough to live. Does not care about fitness, does not have any personal hobbies (other than scroll tiktok and watch Netflix), y’all get the gist. Your partner just does not have the emotional capacity to feel that much. They are able to feel sad, happy, excited, anger etc. But they are never VERY sad, VERY happy, VERY excited, nor VERY angry.
I believe what drives motivation and ambition, is the intensity of emotion itself. This is when the ability to detach yourself from outcomes too easily, actually backfires on you.
As compared to your partner, you are passionate about issues and topics, and you are able to take a stand and have opinions. You are able to want something so badly, and plan a way to get there because you feel the desire to have it. Your partner sometimes thinks you’re “overreacting” and that you “do too much”, “chill.” Because they would not do the same. Because they always take the neutral stance on topics, and genuinely feel neutral about it. I believe it is okay to feel neutral about things, but being neutral about everything does not actually mesh well with someone that likes to debate.
Your friends are okay with your partner, only because she/he is “nice and chill”, and that it is obvious they genuinely want to be with you and treats your relationship seriously (does not talk to anyone else, allocates time to spend with you despite being busy etc. generally a good partner)
There is nothing wrong with your partner’s personality. You just know that deep inside, “chill” is not what you really want. This personality of theirs might be someone else’s dream.
You have voiced out this concern before, and your partner thinks that it’s “normal” for couples to have differences. They do not find it a strong enough reason to break up.
Asking all of you now, is this a valid cause for break up? You are about to celebrate your 2nd year anniversary too. been contemplating it for the longest time but genuinely don’t know if my idea of a relationship is too idealistic, or there really is a problem…
