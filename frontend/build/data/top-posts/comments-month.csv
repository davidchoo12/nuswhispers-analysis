60865,107687,"TW: R*pe / SA. Need to ask everyone's opinion here. Also long story but please do read. 
So a guy (Let's call him Matt) and his gf (Let's call her Jenn) lives together. They've been doing good together, until one day, they argue about going to a night club. Let's just say Matt doesn't want Jenn to go to a night club cause he's worried about her safety.
But Jenn insist, saying she'll be just fine. Matt still wouldn't allow it. So they argued a lot. Jenn however, always find a way to go to the club. Either by lying about her location, made excuses, or simply just wait for Matt to fall asleep early. Everytime Matt found out, he'll get mad cause he's so worried about her. Jenn however, continued to do this like more than 10 times, and got caught by Matt at least 7 times. 
Matt is very forgiving, but even he has a limit. The only thing he doesn't want Jenn to do is to go to a night club. That's it. Nothing else. But Jenn didn't care. Matt told her, that if she goes there again, one more time, the relationship is over. Jenn, thinking it's just another chance, simply just go out anyways. She doesn't care anymore. 
Unfortunately for that night, after hours in the night club, she got r*ped and SAed by a guy there. She called Matt, crying, told him everything that happened. Matt immediately drove and picked her up, went to the hospital and police station immediately to make reports and gather all those evidence. Took hours, 
but thankfully, the evidence gathered are clear, and the police said for now, they can go home while they go make an arrest on the suspect. It was very late night at that point. 
Matt, however, drove Jenn back to her parents' house. Jenn feeling confused and asked why. Matt said that he's sorry about everything that happened to her and it's not her fault, however, he's a man of his word. He said that he did warned her that if she goes to the club one more time, the relationship is over. Regardless of what happens, even if she's safe and nothing bad happen, the relationship is still over. Matt did say that if she needed help about the case, he'll help. But that doesn't mean he and Jenn are together. 
He already packed every Jenn's belongings from his house the moment she walked out to go to the club. All of it is in the car, and he carried it for her to her parents'. Jenn, crying and begging, asking him not to leave her and said she won't do it again. Matt however, said that he has his limit too. And he said why does it need for this horrible thing to happen then only she'll listen. Before he leaves, he told her again, that he's sorry about what happened, and that if she needed any help with the case, he'll help. But that's it. 
So, the question is, is Matt wrong for doing what he did in the end?

60856,107669,"Can someone explain to me in very simple and pragmatic terms why I should spend a single sec trying to learn my dialect (Teochew) than to learn an actual useful language like French or German in addition to English and Mandarin? 
A lot of people get all hostile about “remembering your roots” but I can’t remember a single instance in my life where I was paid for being able to do what my ancestors did. My grandfather used to have oil lamps, do I have to learn that? He drove a manual shift car? Should I learn that? Once he got sick and he picked some random wild plants from the side of the road and made tea out of it instead of eating his antibiotics. He died without having eaten a single pill that was prescribed to him by a Mount Elizabeth doctor. Should I learn that? 
There needs to be a system by which people pick and choose which aspects of our ancestors’ lives we ought to learn from. What is that system? Based on usefulness? What is the metric? 
It’s funny people advocate for things that isn’t fundamentally helpful to the actual struggles of life, most of which are material. Please let us advocate first making a living and then you can learn whatever obscure language or tradition if you have spare time.

60832,107634,"8 Reasons why I want to stay single
*This article may be sensitive or offensive to some people, Viewer discretion is advised*
1. I want a Mancave (pretty self explanatory) and wanting someone that likes the same things as I do (games and anime) and attractive or at least decently looking at the same time (sounds f*** up I know, looks like I am expecting so much for someone that is average looking). I like games and anime, which i will less likely have high chance to find a partner with the same hobby, even if I did, most of also have high beauty expectations of their partner. 
2. I have NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder), will hurt the people around me or have disagreement and conflict, especially people I stay with in the future (based on past experiences staying in rental flats with landlord) 
3. I don't see myself as a man, more rather like a guy that refuses to grow up. I don't want to succumb to the society expectation and pressure. I have alot of questions about life and I am not bending my will against anything unless my questions get answered and I get a reason to everything that happens. I don't want to accept the things for what they are. I know many people just accept life the way as it is and just succumb to life but that's not what I want to live my life and this is the conviction that I have that may not align with many people out there that just want to live their lives normally and follow the crowd and go with the flow. 
4. Need to impress females with dressing and styles, which means
a. I need to spent more buying more expensive clothes rather than uniqlo
b. I need to wear clothes that I don't like just to impress people
c. I cannot wear the clothes that I like, that includes clothes that are comfy, looks cool and not suits and ties that are tight, suffocating, boring and plain. 
5. I am not a sweet or smooth talker or someone that will say mushy things to impress girls, or what gen z called ""Rizz"", or someone that will soften words or cushion words to make everything sound okay to flatter girls. I also have low EQ so I probably won't be able to get out of tricky situations using wits nor outsmart high eq people. 
6. I am not good looking or attractive, and I will be in competition with thousands and thousands of guys out there that are willing to put in the effort to dress up and impress people. Guys nowadays are going far to the extent of spending alot of money on membership going to the gym, protein shakes, eating chicken breast or plain food, wearing makeup, painting nails and taking care of their skin with tons of skincare products. I am not willing to go to that extend just so I can compete with those guys out there. 
7. High cost of living; I am not rich and I do not want to climb the corporate ladder as I want to avoid all politics and drama at all cost. I also want to be happy go lucky person and doing what I love. I don't want to do the things I don't like. As a result, I will not be successful and earning more income than the rest of the guys out there that are willing to sacrifice. It doesn't benefit me in anyway to get a partner other than buying a house. 
8. *DEAL BREAKER* I have very bad experience with women, almost like PTSD from my encounter with my landlord (my friend's mum ) and also my friend herself. Basically I rented a room with them and there are alot of horror stories of her being calculative and trying to restrict my freedom and putting fear onto me, few times invading my privacy by going into my room and claiming that I stole her stuff when it's just very small things like clothes peg and rags. She also extorted me to pay her the full price of the WiFi upgrade even though I only used it for few months and I paid for it but she demanded me to pay the remaining even when I moved out, putting the blame onto me saying that it's because of me that they upgraded the WiFi, even though they are also benefiting from the WiFi. She also uses society standards and expectation to put pressure on me and wanting to conform me into the typical person that fits into social norm.She brings me out for meals on the pretense of wanting to use it show that kindness to me and then using it to control me and gaslight me into being a obedient person to them, says that they helped me alot and I am being ungrateful. They expect alot in return for the kindness they shown me when i didn't even ask it in the first place. She also constantly harass me during working hours by spam WhatsApp or email me and demanding I reply her email immediately, if not she will threaten to chase me out. She also did not give me any tenancy agreement and then even when she did she says she doesn't want to give me because she wants to protect herself. Overall she is a very overbearing and calculative person and uses all kinds of methods and tricks to gaslight me in making me the most evil person that trying to ruin their lives when I am just trying to live my own life in peace without disturbance. She gave me so much emotional and mental damage to the point where I need to seek a counsellor for therapy. 
I also rmb during my primary sch, a female classmate also extorts me money because I accidentally broke her pencil or pencil case I forgotten but something alone the line, she say if I don't give her money she will inform the teacher and her parents, at that time my mum wasn't around alr and there is no one I could seek help or advice from, I also don't know what to do and for fear she will report on me, I kept taking money from my grandma to pay her just so she won't report me. At that time I didn't even know I was being extorted. 
Basically, it's just one vicious cycle after another just to catch up with another vicious cycle IMO. E.g needing to climb corporate ladder to have more earning power so that I can dress better, be more attractive and impress others. It's just one thing that leads to the other. 
In summary, I'm a f*** up average person that is boring and nerdy af that likes attractive women but doesn't want to give a slightest damn effort to dress up and impress others but yet at the same time wanting to get everything. Which is absolutely impossible and I know it myself. So I just gonna stay single for the rest of my life and just live my life my own in peace while letting the rest of the world fighting among themselves.
OR
If I can really find a nerdy girl that likes anime and games and yet attractive at the same time, that also happens to like me at the same time(virtually nearly impossible, chances of it is 0.06% gacha rate or God blesses)

60815,107606,"I am in a rather new relationship , just a couple of months in , but we are often get into arguments almost every week. I think the issue is that i’m a more laid back person and my partner is super sensitive.
Our arguments always stem from my partner being angry at me for doing something wrong. Examples include like not saying goodnight, lack of emojis in our texts, all in all things that i have never thought would be a big deal. Worst thing is that when my partner gets angry , my partner would go silent on me for a couple of days without resolving the problem , and those few days are very agonizing for me.
I feel like i often refrain from expressing myself freely in hopes to not accidentally offend my partner , my friends and family mentioned that my partner might be on the more childish side, but my partner is older than me.
We are currently in the midst of an argument now and the silence from my partner is making me suffer.

60797,107569,"TLDR: My gf hates my family and says and does mean things to them secretly, but I love her. What should I do?
My gf and I have been together for almost 4 years now. We are staying together in my family’s home. We grew up in completely different backgrounds so naturally we would have different upbringing. Before we got together, I had brought 2 very important points to her and that is my family is very important to me and if she can get along with them, it would mean the world to me. And if she can’t, I would really appreciate her being courteous towards them. I feel like my parents have been treating her so nicely and doesn’t disrespect her in any way because she is who I chose. But it has been almost 4 years and she hasn’t shown any basic respect at all (eg: greeting my parents when she sees them when we/she return home). And honestly to me, this is a huge disrespect. I had sat her down and talked about this so many times, but it just doesn’t seem to be working.
Recently she also confessed me out of guilt that she contaminates my parent’s food / drinks with my dog’s urine and that is freaking unhygienic and disgusting. I was too stunned to speak when she confessed. I didn’t know what to do or say at all… It has been a week and we haven’t talked yet. She keeps saying she’s very apologetic but I really do not know if I am able to get pass this. I honestly fear for my family’s safety if this continues because I don’t know what will happen in the future if she gets annoyed at them again… And as a cherry on top, she is living here rent free and does not help out in any chores at all.
I love her a lot and really wanted to spend the rest of my life with her, but after hearing her confession I really don’t know what to do or feel now.

60795,107567,"I feel kind of lost.
I am happy in my life in most aspect except dating.
Everytime I go after a girl in my life, I keep getting rejected.
The most recent made really question myself.
This girl was a 10/10 in my opinion. She was pretty, kind and had a nice personality.
However, within a few interactions, I realised that she had no interest in me. I mean I would ask about her and try to get to know her but she never really asked much about me and she seemed quite uninterested during our conversations.
I still maintained as friends with her. Slowly, we got closer and even she started to make jokes and seemed interested in talking with me. She also opened up to me more with her personal stuff more.
I was going through a rough patch with some family problems when she needed some help. I went out of my way to help her but I requested that she helped me with something else which she agreed to do so.
She never returned the favour and I felt hurt by it. I told her that I felt hurt and she said sorry but never actually returned the favour. Instead, she came back to me asking for more help. She also said that the time spent where explained that I felt hurt was a waste of time and she didnt even bother to try to understand why I felt hurt which made me feel sick.
She was spending time with her other friends going outing and stuff which made me feel really small and unworthy, as if I am a tissue paper.
I attribute the whole experience to a single point of failure. She wasn't attracted to me. To put it more bluntly, I wasn't attractive at all.
I really dont want to go through this at all again.
If I like a girl, I want to at least have a fighting chance at it, not be completely ignored like this. At least, she should want to date me to find out if we are compatible.
I want to be attractive.
The problem is I don't know what I am lacking or how to approach this.
I have things like studies figured out. For example, for Math, I just need to practice questions and for English, I just need to read a lot.
However, I dont know what I need to do for this.
If there is a method to do this, I would like to know. Are there any requirements to be attractive?
I want to be a 10/10 guy, nothing less than that.

60805,107585,"Is it a sampling issue or are people from not-so-wealthy families more spendthrift, tend to engage in a lot more hedonistic activities, and are much more arrogant than people from generationally wealthy families?
I have dated a total of 4 guys.
One was from a ultra-high net worth family. He was my first. I dated him the longest. His parents own one of the most famous food product companies in Southeast Asia. I met him at a friend's wedding. He had just come back from the US, graduated from Penn, in-line to take over the business as the oldest child. Due to differences in goals (he doesn't want kids period), we felt it was better if we parted ways. Apart from the kid issue, I would have married him.
He was an intense individual, very ambitious, very energetic, very calculating, very forward-looking, very pragmatic. He was also modest and thrifty. He loves eating at hawker centres (no air-con), he always wears his old PE shorts from high school, carries an old iPhone with a cracked screen, borrows suits to wear to weddings, buys cakes from Four Leaves to celebrate his parents' birthdays, never travels for leisure (only for work), takes the bus and MRT whenever he can etc. The only luxury he'd splurge on is air travel (he only flies SQ but economy). At 30 he already received all of his dad's holdings because they wanted to avoid the inheritance process to save on inconvenience. His parents are the same as he is—believed strongly in a world-class education, for which they were willing to spend an arm and a leg. Otherwise, their whole family pretty much lived by a similar philosophy.
The other three were pretty similar. Middle-class white-collar families. They themselves had white-collar office jobs—two were lawyers and one was a Morgan Stanley banker. They were partygoers. Traveled frequently for leisure. Ate at expensive restaurants. Went to concerts, even paying $1200 on one occasion for two tickets. Bought the latest phones, laptops, gadgets. The banker bought a BMW 3 series 2 years into his job. He also drank expensive spirits and wine. Once, one of them found out that I dated someone from a crazy rich family and he claimed that he was self-made and didn't have to live off daddy's money. All of whom were very eager to present themselves as upper-class, which was completely contrary to what I personally experienced being close to a centimillionaire family. I broke up with all three of them for similar reasons, I didn't enjoy what they did for fun and they kept putting pressure on me to do what they did. The common reason was ""[I] will not be young forever."" I concur, but I much prefer to focus on my work as I am saving up to buy rental properties to retire.
I have taken a break from dating because it is really frustrating that young people who refuse to participate in ""enjoying life"" are somehow treated like there's something wrong with us, when I am almost sure that it wasn't the case one or two generations ago. I'm still trying to make rent, I don't feel like I have enough money in my savings account for if I get laid off, I have student loans etc. I make good money (high 4-figure monthly) as an auditor. I don't think I'm comfortable enough financially to start traveling. But people expect me to. It makes me wonder if society in general think a certain lifestyle is how the ultra-rich tend to live without actually knowing how most of them actually live. Or is it the truth that the wealthy does spend their time in high-living and I just met a guy who was from an unconventional rich family?

60818,107609,"Dear Admin, please post this, as I really need an advice urgently.
Hi all, I have a big question regarding my decision to file it to the executive director or HR of my company, hence I need some suggestions from you guys. I’m a biomedical science researcher and have completed a BSc, a MSc, and a PhD in a local autonomous uni, and had 2 years of work experience. I had very little issues with my previous bosses, and I was even offered a new contract, which I rejected due to my pursuit of my PhD.
Never have I ever expect myself to fail a job probation, ever! Unfortunately, a few days ago my boss told me that I couldn’t meet his expectations, and hence he won’t let me pass my probation. Honestly speaking, as a scientist, I’ve done whatever he asked, and in fact I actually did more than what he expected, like trying out new solutions, thinking of new projects, troubleshooting, etc. I’ve also never once failed to update him whenever he asked for results. Hence, I honestly think this is an extremely unfair treatment to me, and I would like to file a complaint to the HR or executive director of my company.
The way I record my experimental results was one of his reasons to not pass my probation Since the day I joined, I have been doing all data recording based on my own format using powerpoint, excel, and word, which my previous bosses had no problem with at all. However, I was in a big shock when he only told me that my format doesn’t meet his preference at all after 4 freaking months, and demanded me to redo all my data recording according to his ridiculously strict formatting, which certainly takes plenty of time to do, considering the large amount of data accumulated over the past 4 months. I did try my best to do, but bear in mind that his format is ridiculously specific, and it’s not even meant for publication, presentation, conferences, seminars, these results are merely just to show him what I’ve done. Since then, every week he would approach me to complain about very minor issues here and there, and I did tell him that I’m trying my best, and on top of that, I still have to fulfull other duties at work. Imagine having to organize my data in all powerpoint, word, and excel files that I’ve accumulated for 4 months, it really wasn’t easy to do all within a short period of time. If he wasn’t satisfied with the way I record my data, shouldn’t he have told me from the start, instead of telling me after 4 freaking months?
Second was his bad science. I believe the reason why he hired me is due to my experience and expertise in this particular research field, but he refused to take my suggestions/advice positively. I have friends working in big pharma who are experts in this field and I’ve actually consulted them to discuss my ideas before I suggested them to my boss, but my boss always thinks he is right, and doesn’t give me the chance to suggest or execute my ideas as a scientist. To me, as a phd level scientist, I strongly think I should be given the freedom to come out with my own ideas and discuss with him, and be less micromanaged, but his style is totally opposite, where he plans everything on his own without discussing with me, and I can only do as he asked, which really makes me feel as if I’m just a research assistant rather than a postdoc/research fellow.
There was also once where something in our project plan actually went wrong, and he put the blame on me, though it was 100% his fault. All these while I have been trying my best to get the results out as soon as possible, but he asked me to do something else rather than focusing on my experiments, so when the results weren’t out on time, he blamed me for not being to deliver my results as scheduled.
There were also a few things that he asked me to do, and I did as he said, but during the confrontation with him, he said he asked me to do these stuff but I didn’t deliver. I then listed out the tasks that I actually did as he told, and he just brushed it off by saying “it’s okay, I’ve already made my decision anyway”.
What stunt me the most is that I soon found out that he is actually running out of funding as his grant application has failed, and the lab funding was worsened after the institute decided to cut funding, so in order to keep the lab going, he has to cut cost by laying off staff. Since I’m still on probation, he can actually leverage my probation to kick me out, just by simply saying that I can’t meet his expectations, which is actually not true.
What should I do? Should I just let him terminate me? Should I resign? Or should I file a complain to the company’s HR or director?
Thanks.

I have been chatting with this girl almost daily for the past two years. We were classmates but and both of us have graduated and we are both working adults. I have a crush on her from the start but i guess she didn’t catch it. Now we are both working adults, our texting context is usually her ranting to me about her work and some part and bits of her personal life. Did ask her out a few times but it only happen once or twice and was brush away with reasons like her working schedule changed or she got last min plan. Lately we still texts but her reply has been getting slower and slower to like one text a day. Did i missed the chance? Should i be thicked skin and give another shot?

60806,107587,"i often read stories abt couples breaking up for their BTO/EC, and lose up to 200k for EC.
i think it is stupid not to proceed with marriage. at MOP, EC typically earns 300-500K.
good location BTO as well also earn 300-500k. you buy at 600k, you sell at 1 million for BTO.
although BTO the penalty is much lesser - just abt 50k penalty after signing agreement for lease.
So If you already sign Agreement For Lease or BTO, or alr exercised the option for EC, then just go ahead with marriage, especially if you are young.
who knows if it might work.
if it doesnt work, in 7 years time you stand to get 300-500k in total. or each person 200k on average.
it is good to have multiple marriages also, it benefits and create employment for family lawyers.
from that MOP sale, you are set with your first pot of gold.

60819,107611,"Ref #96185
I chanced upon your confession from 21 March 2021 regarding the pick-up culture of girls in Singapore. This surprised me. I did not know someone had asked this online before.
I hope you read this, despite being 2 years late.
You wrote: ""How is it still possible for guys who have lost faith in online dating to stand a chance to meet interesting girls that they randomly come across on the street? Or is it really a social stigma in Sg that random guy approaching a girl on the MRT is deemed a creep? Are there any effective solutions to this?""
You have met someone, mid-20s, who has done a good degree of all of that for 2 years now. Working at it for the past 2 years (since 2021) until today, and still pressing on.
My personal story cut very short is that I was persistently rejected by girls during compulsory education years, and short-changed of genuine interactions when signing up for Events. Problem with Events is that you cannot pick / choose who you pair with. Certain people there can socially judge you negatively for being some despo (and hungry) who just want to pick/date girls.
They make you feel bad for something you were genuinely shortchanged and then benchmark u as a social creep. These are toxic, socially over-privileged who don't know what's like to not have natural social advantage.
In other cases, signing for events/dating-events/CCAs do not guarantee your gender-balance and you end up wasting precious time trying to fit-into group decorum to which you never really signed up for.
I personally felt I was running out of years to get valuable practice and bucket list feelings/desires of just flirting and being playful around the opposite-gender in general.
You would have side-tangent your main purpose - which is to practice approaching girls of your desire, try to get them feeling comfortable around you and see if they're willing to stay in contact thereafter.
I decided to take things into my own hands and cut-away all of that unnecessary social-off-tangent. Those social settings dont work for me. Perhaps its coz I have my own line of thinking. I wanted for myself, a free space to test and explore my own thinking and what I really wanted to experience during my general interactions with girls.
I also wanted to stress-test what I could achieve, express and adjust when I interacted with girls. And find how exactly, I can reduce the likelihood of creeping them out over the course of my Work. And to also spend time reflecting on what kind of girls I need to let go - despite me trying and failing at hitting on them.
I never regretted. I had full autonomy on the exact type and looks of girls I caught-eye and wanted to hit on. This basic feeling should not be taken for granted.
The past 2 years consisted of me falling back on dormant legacy personality traits from young. For me, I had this thing about words and writing. Hence, I wrote cards of general message/encouragement and use it as a leverage to give it to a girl of my choice. You could append your number behind, or just a handle if you weren't keen enough to be so open. You can take creative direction and just adjust what you wanna say based on the season or place you are going to visit. Possibilities are endless and you feel real good just expressing yourself.
I tried many things. From just merely giving and not talking. To the more recent years of relying less on my card and really just speaking to test water. When my confidence grew, I allocated greater emotional strategy to Exit away from girls who replied to me in a very ignorant manner. Coz - abundance mindset.
For the good girls I experienced and successfully gave my card. You ofc hope they get back to you. However, whether a conversation does hold thru - still mirrors what you recounted. yourself.
From that point on, I opened my own exploring on what works, what doesn't work and most importantly - what lasts as a good impression.
This act on girls and cards also tested me regarding all various ways, permutation and setting I can best approach them. At times, making mistakes, feeling nervous and consequently creeping them out were inevitable. Nevertheless, thru the bad emotions I felt, I pressed on somehow to just find another way to do it - to also let go and self-talk against past emotional baggage that remind me that ""I'm creepy/despo to do all this.""
I encourage you to go out and try pick up girls in your best self in public places. You have to start somewhere and see which parts of your own personality are best tapped on when you vibe off to a girl you eye candied. You also get this priceless benefit to explore all these bucket-list excitements, emotions and flirt-desires before you really get too old to regret not doing them.
Its good to have your fill of these very impulsive stuff instead of answering society norm to ""feel to clean and decent in front of all girls in the Universe - that approaching/pursuing girls you don't know is condemned upon"".
The micro-thrills of some girl you hit on through your own effort - replying to your number, Tele or IG DM or beaming at your flirts/thoughtfulness etc - is priceless to experience. An important bucket list to experience enough of before you get too old to look appropriate for the Acts.
Find ""yourself"" whilst you look around outside. You have your own type and age range of girls. Take ownership and don't feel bad for having such a preference. So long as you stay respectful and genuine. Have nothing to hide.
I am personally still kicking my bucket list to talk up school girls/students as much as I can - if such suitable opportunities arise. It feels good to be young again.
The self-discovery journey is not guaranteed to be easy. I had my very testing and emotional moments in earlier periods of missing girls, lacking confidence, getting affected by social reminders and at worse cases, creeping girls out because they could already sense I'm present even before I do anything.
Advice for you - creeping girls out will be inevitable. Keep telling yourself that no guy is socially pitch-perfect to creep 0 girls in his entire life. Don't listen to any white-knighted guy who socially reminds you about (sexual) harassment and fear of accusation, and then links back to how ""you need to be a decent guy.""
These are people who gaslight what you truly want in your social energy and its your right to explore as much of it. Just know when to let go of some girl if she just looks at you so revoltingly.
Think statistically on ""Creep Rate"". You can't impress everyone. What you can best do is to work on confidence and timing such that you can REDUCE the likelihood of creepiness by making approaches as seamless, natural and clean (minimal hesitation) as possible. It will take time. You will not master it overnight. Neither does it stay consistent from girl to girl because you also may be sensitive and conscious about her unspoken vibe.
Once you have enough experience of picking-up girls. You will come to feel good that you have your own reserve and abundance of experiences to look back on. You will come to realise how some girls were just plain bs to hit on. Perhaps it was just looks and shallowness (and prob some lust) you approached them.
On the contrary - you may feel surprised to reflect on the other set of girls who left a good, sweet, gracious and decent impression on you - even if you didn't eventually get to date them and have since fallen out of conversation. It will guide you better on what exactly you are looking for in your ideal girl.
For me, I sort of had my rough image of that girl. My experiences have been slowly helping me confirm most of such vibes and features as what really counts. Very recently, I had personal encounters with (6-7)/10 girls (on looks) but proud of myself to have advanced on them because of their (8-9)/10 personality.
Sometimes also due to age gap, these girls are still maturing in look - but personality 100. I believe that they have potential to become even prettier in later years.
There is also a risk that some girl's boyfriend will reply you/confront you online regarding ""picking-up"" their girlfriend in the public place. You will need to know how to deal with it.
(1) pick your battles. You do not need to reply every boyfriend who messages you back. Some of these boyfriends may just be insecure pussy who just dont trust their girlfriend enough that she will be easily swayed to you.
(2) If you choose to reply that boyfriend, just tell them what you are doing and looking for. You got nothing to hide. But no need to be too nice. You dont owe them an apology. You hit on a girl (back then) to which you got no reason to believe she is attached. All you only did is just talk her up and give her your card. At most - just say sorry if the gf felt creeped out.
Different strokes work for different timings/environments. Not every setting you can afford talking a girl up. Sometimes, its just better to approach, say your small piece, give her your card and then walk away. Other times, it is better to spend time small talking her up or at least, just confessing your feelings and outright asking for her number.
You own your adjustments and flexibility. Versatility is all on you. There is so much more experience I could share with you but - it would be very lengthy.
For now, please just know that you got someone here supporting you in finding your true happiness, albeit it being socially deviant. Throw those peer pressure advice out the window! Listen to yourself.
Don't regret not doing enough when you are older and when your age is really way above that your own conscience cannot take it.
All the best!

60854,107664,"I feel like this is something I can’t really talk to people about, and I really need to let it out in the world. Even my closest friends, although they have some idea, they don’t really know the extent of it. I’ve been in love with a guy for almost 6 years now. I don’t know if it’s love. I wouldn’t even know what to call it. We haven’t even spent that much time together, but it was truly love at first sight (or love at first meeting at least). The little time we’ve spent together in last few years has been eclectic. I’ve never felt the way that I feel with him with anyone else. 
Now here’s where the thing gets complicated. I’ve been in a very very serious relationship for 5 years. Don’t get me wrong, I truly do love my boyfriend very very much, and I do see a future with him. We will probably get married one day. He’s perfect for me in all the right ways.  
However, I can’t get the thought of the other guy out of my mind. I think of him every day, even when I don’t see him for months at a stretch. My body shakes every time I see him. I know he’s not good for me, and he’s quite manipulative but despite knowing all the bad things about him, I still can’t let him go. It’s been years, and I can’t let him go. I think it’s reciprocated from his side, and he’s expressed it subtly a few times, but he will never own up to it or have a genuine conversation and it because that’s just how he is. I am 100 percent sure he’s not right for me, but I still can’t move on from him. No matter what he does or what I hear about him. I can swear there’s something inexplainable between us. He even makes my body and mind respond in strange ways. 
I love my boyfriend and know he’s the correct choice- he’s amazing too and he makes my life better by just being in it. I don’t know how to move on from the other guy- tried hating him, giving it time, tried everything but it’s been years and he still has the same effect on me. 
What should I do?

In our field, some patients are (partly) naked due to their limited capacities/illnesses/procedures and the nurses have to physically handle them in their various degrees of undress. If they were regular old patients I wouldn't really care, but once in a while they have to go check or even adjust some young, fit guy's d*ck and it makes me feel weird and kinda jealous. Once I heard her talking with another nurse about if they needed to some procedure on a guy's genitals and I was so disturbed I just pretended I didn't hear them and quickly walked away. I mean I know it's just part of the job - and maybe even hypocritical of me to say as someone in healthcare myself - but I can't help but feel like nakedness is something sacred to be treasured and shared with a partner exclusively, but that some kind of innocence is lost here..

60859,107678,"It's going to be a long story that I need to get off from my chest and pardon me from all my grammar in case there are any grammar police in the comments section.
I have been with my gf for 4 years since 2019 and there were many ups and downs between us. But today she decided to break up with me because of everything that happened and also because of her parents. Some back story - she has depression and I have been by her side in early 2019 and decided to get together with her because I really care for her. And there was once she attempted by overdosing and I went with her to the hospital and stayed overnight with her. Her parents didn't even came to visit her immediately and they only came the following morning with policeman and I was arrested and detained for 48 hours because her parents told the police that I was the cause of her to suicide. It took me 1 year to get her parents to really understand me and I have to endure things like can only sit at the balcony because I am forbidden to go into their living room, I cant use their toilet and have to run to the nearest toilet outside to use before running back to her house balcony. Everything was ok but in 2020 when my gf shared her dreams over dinner table with her mum and elder sister, she got shot down by saying she becoming an accountant will never be rich as an interior designer and that almost made her want to attempt again but it took me a while to calm her down while maintaining my cool in front of her parents. Side track her sister is an interior designer and she is always borrowing money from my gf which pisses me off because when my gf doesn't have enough to lend her, the sister would tell her mum and she will get scolded badly for being useless. Her sister is also married to an Ang Moh banker and stays in a bungalow, have 3 dogs and a helper and 1 son and the irony is she always have to borrow money. Another irony is her sister could stay overnight with her then bf and not give a shit about her mum and her sister could easily get away with not paying her university school fees and not get scolded by her parents, but I have to made sure I was a good guy before my gf could stay over at my house.
I hate her sister because she keeps telling my gf to find Ang Moh or find sugar daddy so she can have money, saying i am useless and not earning as much as her husband. And her mum keeps telling my gf to find someone around her age like her classmates and all, i am only slightly older than my gf who have graduated and in the workforce. All this overwhelming thoughts went into her mind and depressive state which one day in 2022 she decided to take a break from our relationship and dated someone else but she was not happy because the guy abused her, forcing her to do things against her will. Her mum did not want to help her break up, so I stepped in and told off the guy and her mum, and this incident cause her mum and dad to have bad impression of me. We have to hide our relationship moving forward and it appears to be very taxing for her and just today she said it to me and said her parents will never be accepting us and growing older, she feel that she wants to have her parents validation and blessings as compared to 4 years ago when she just wanted to heck care them. I don't get it, her parents don't even give her allowance, don't even pay for her medical bills when she see doctor and psychologists, don't even give her money and ask her to keep buying things from Shopee or buying food home, don't even care about her and only scold her for being useless when she can't lend her sister money, to date she have already lend her sister 3k. Even if she gets awards from school, the parents don't even bat an eyelid. Yet today she says she don't see a future in the relationship and wants to break up. I really don't know what to do now, as much as I hate her parents and want to bring her out from that shit hole, suddenly she drop me a bomb saying that.

Basically, in a whatsapp group, one of my friend sent a photo of his backyard, and it's at night. All he said was ""guys, I can't believe that thing is there"", implying that there's a supernatural being in the photo.
Then everyone in the group was like ""Omg that's so scary"", or ""That's insane knowing the ghost is right there"". Thing is.... There's absolutely nothing :/ I asked where, and everyone gave me a different answer, then all proceeded to go like ""Oh there's actually more than one that's scary"".
So what I did was, I took the photo, put it in Lightroom and just a touch of Photoshop to brighten up the photo enough. And there's still.... Nothing :/ I sent to them and they say I need to look carefully. I even changed different filter to make it clearer, and still nothing. I asked them where are the ghosts at all?
And they kicked me out of the group :/
I showed the photo to my family and other friends, all of them say they can see it and when I showed the brighten up photo edit, all of them hates me for pointing out there's nothing.
I learned that people just want to have the attention of ""Oooh look at meeeee I can see supernatural stuff ooooooh I'm cool you're not ooooh"" :/
So how AITA for calling it out? :/
Look, I believe supernatural being exist. Just, stop pretending to see it when there's obviously nothing. This is real life. Not some anime weeb shit where you have special powers to save the universe.

All my friends know this girl has a huge crush on me.and she has been trying to get my attention for ages. Actually I have no interest in her so I just tried to be polite whenever she talk to me. No flirting whatsoever. Just that the longer I see her, the more I thought why not just talk to her because we are in the same course and I find it hard to avoid her. She has never confessed so I just acted like I didn't know. But it was very obvious and our friends often teased her about it.
I never thought much about it as I wasn't seeing anyone at that time. Once a few of us organized a gathering and I had a few drinks. She came right up to me and tried to talk to me alone. Eventually she confessed that she liked me, I didn't know what reaction she wanted from me so I told her I only saw her as a friend. I was very sure of what I said but she just threw herself at me all of a sudden. I think the drinks took over and we kissed for a while.
Over the next few days she kept texting me, trying to make me officiate our relationship. I thought over it and apolgized to her. I really don't have those kind of feelings for her.
Actually I like someone else but that person has a bf but I don't think its anyone's business so I never told anyone.
Anyway back to this girl. Now she is accusing me of leading her on and taking advantage of her. I don't know what she told her friends but they all kept glaring at me like I'm some big sinner. My friends tell me to just ignore her. They all said I should have pushed her away but guys tend to lose out in these kind of situations so no point arguing with her. They joked that she took advantage of me instead.

60857,107670,"Dear Prof Ben,
I suffer from really bad depression because of underachievement due to laziness and I have attempted suicide two times. 
I was the top student of my primary school and a Raffles Academy student. I never had any tuition, never really did homework, but life has been very accommodating of me. I went into JC with a near perfect grades in sec 4. I then decided to join a sports CCA and because I never did sports, it affected me physically and I put in zero work through J1. I did not promote and my parents decided to take me out of school and they sent me to the US to do community college. My parents are both specialists so my family is well-to-do.
I did two semesters, started working hard for the first time in my life and transferred to MIT course 18. When I was there, old habits returned and I started binging shows on Netflix and didn’t a crap about coursework. I was put on academic warning. My parents made me take an LOA and now I’ve been trapped at home. I did therapy and stuff. They made me do volunteer work, I worked as a Starbucks barista, I started running etc. During all of this I cut myself twice and both times I got saved by my brother.
I hate that when I sit down to study, I would understand quickly, very quickly, drift off during classes and then not practice because I believed that I already understand the material and then I would fail. I hate myself because a part of me keeps letting myself down even though I do want to work. I want to work hard. But I can’t control this voice in my head that keeps sending me wrong signals that “okay you got it.” I don’t want to cut myself again.

60867,107689,"The dating scene has gotten progressively worse with the increasing connectedness of the world as a whole (ironic, I know!), where the average female is now able to gain access to a far larger pool of potential romantic partners. 
Why settle for a diploma graduate when you are receiving attention from degree holders? 
Why would you agree to go on a date using public transport, when you can get driven around by a car owner instead? 
Why date a 1.7m tall average-build man, when you can look up to a 1.85m tall muscular handsome man?
That’s the thing, it is ridiculous to not fish around and monkey-branch for better job opportunities, much like a potential offer from Janestreet/Blackrock and Google/Meta will always make you snub an offer even from Govtech. The same holds true for dating options, since a younger impressionable lady will quite literally be inundated with suitors. 
By no means am I calling for some social reform, or that women should lower their dating expectations and agree to go out with any Tom, Dick or Harry. I, along with my closest peers, believe, and are all working on ourselves, so that we may become better individuals, developing holistically.
But I can see my own privilege/opportunities/background. Education, finances, health, appearances, family, occupation wise, we are all above-average and stand a reasonable chance in terms of securing a healthy relationship.
I am willing and able to improve, because I can.
Not everyone is willing to, or even able to.
I can see primary school batch mates jailed for crimes.
I can see secondary school batch mates bouncing around from one dead-end job to another.
I can see JC batch mates grappling with body image problems.
I can see army batch mates struggle with communicating.
I can see university batch mates mired in financial issues.
I can see internship batch mates develop health complications.
I can see my graduating class trapped in terrible jobs with low pay.
I can see colleagues manipulated in terrible familial relationships.
Notice how after you come to the end of the list, you naturally just think ‘I only want someone normal who made it through all of that. It is not too much to ask of, is it?’
This is considering that confounders such as car/house ownership, savings, investments, hobbies, etc are not even included.
As time goes on, the majority of men will have already been given up by the majority of women.
And at some point, these men will give up. 
It is not unreasonable to want to date the best possible man. 
I really have no idea how to solve this, since personally, I would probably struggle with settling down when there is almost always better candidates in your inbox.
It’s just unfortunate that the end result is huge amounts of unmatched individuals, both men and women. A large proportion of attached women will also feel like they settled for a backup option that is nowhere near their main choice, while a large proportion of attached men will feel trapped with an unsatisfiable partner. 
I don’t think the politicians have a way to sort this out either.
It’s funny, especially with the current affairs playing out like that. HAHA

60812,107603,"I am not angry, just upset with the dynamics between me and my mum and idk how to make things better.
My mum rarely asks about my day or what I do. When I initiate to tell her stuff, she starts talking about herself or my siblings. When this happens I stop talking. Not because I'm upset but because I have no idea if my own mother is interested in me. I don't want to keep talking if she is not interested. It's fine. I can share those stories with my friends, even though she is my mum and I want her to know something about me. She knows nothing about me beyond 7 years old.
I don't blame her. Personally I feel having three kids is too much for her to handle. She is occupied with my older sister and my younger sis who are more accomplished. She simply doesn't have any spare attention or energy for me. Not that she doesn't want to.
Sigh. Not interested in me? Fine. But it's annoying when she starts saying things about me that are not true. For instance, telling her friends that I don't eat a certain food. Fuck bitch. I have been eating that in front of you my whole life. You just haven't been paying attention.
Sometimes i think that maybe I would be happier without my family. The lack of connection breaks my heart more than anything.
Anyone in a similar situation? How to make things better? As time goes by, my family becomes the last perosn I tell anything to. It's sad. I cannot express how lonely I feel. I know my family loves me but there is no understanding and no connection. No one knows anything about me at home. They remember nothing even if I told them. Being busy is one thing but if you don't ask and don't remember shit then that is just messed up. Also, I am always the last perosn to know things at home. They discuss with each other at their own time and one notices that I'm not being told. I don't think it's intentional. It's prolly just that there are too many people (?) . I'm married with kids. I told my husband that if we want kids, it must be even number.
How?

I only found a guy friend in year 1 and I thought that I can just stick to him and blend in to the crowd. The problem is he is extremely self absorbed. He thinks that he is very irresistible and all the girls are flocking towards him. there is only one super desperate girl expressing interest in him. The rest are just friends and most of the time, he is the one trying to attract attention.
The other day in the library I overheard him bragging to his friend about the number of girls he managed to attract in year 1. To my horror, he mentioned that I am one of those nutty girls going crazy over him. I felt so disgusted because I do not have any romantic feelings towards him and I am just trying to survive in school. I want to distance myself from him when semester starts but I will become a loner and it just sucks…

May I know the reasons you behind saying that? How can a Grad Cert or Master program be necessarily less rigorous than a Bachelors?

60870,107694,"I have a confession to make, something that I have felt ashamed of for the longest time and I hope that sharing it will help me in some way..
In my early teen days, I was groomed and assaulted by my teacher. When the incident happened, all I knew was I felt terrorized in his presence. It wasn't until I was a few years older that I fully understood what he did to me. He would often bring me into a dark room under the pretense of speaking to me about my academics during lunch hours. To intimidate the heck of me so that I wouldn't dare to talk to anyone about it. Another occasion was during one of my exams, he deliberately tried to caress my chest (back then, tiny punchy chest) by reaching his hand through my chest and then pointing to the paper on the mistakes I made using his role as the supervising examiner. He would also insist on offering free private tuition, and when I declined, he would threaten me with my failing grades, that he would speak to my parent, etc. During the coaching session, he would pull my seat next to him and rest his hand next to my butt and press against it on the chair. There were many other events that have caused me so much trauma. 
I have never spoken to anyone about this, as it is a dark, traumatizing, and painful childhood for me. But looking back, I've realised how this has affected my current state of mind, that I find it challenging to have intimacy moment with the opposite gender and there are many trust issues that I need to overcome myself. Writing this, I could still recall the entire incident vividly with fear.. and realise that even with many years that have passed, I'm still profoundly affected and in pain. What should I do? How do I get past this.....

Hi, I'm a 26Y (F) and my Bf 28Y (M). We've been in a stable relationship for the past 4.5 years and recently applied for a BTO as we plan to settle down soon. With work being hectic, we decided to clear our leaves & take a 14-days getaway to Europe. We've already planned the itinerary and made the necessary bookings, but now his mother wants to join us at the final minute. While I don't mind her coming along, she's suggesting additional activities that we're not particularly interested in, and I'm feeling pressured to add in the itinerary. To make matters more complicated, she's also invited her extended family, turning our ""honeymoon"" holiday into a family trip. I've proposed having some days dedicated to spending time with his family and others for just the two of us, in an attempt to find a compromise. Despite my willingness to find a compromise, she insisted that we should stick together due to the unfamiliar environment. Although this trip was intended to be a time of relaxation and rejuvenation, I find myself feeling both confused and stressed. I understand and appreciate his close relationship with his mother but these emotions are beyond my control.

60828,107629,"I can't relate to a lot of people's common childhood experiences. And I feel pretty left out.
Example 1 : People told me that they need to hide under the blanket to feel safe from potential ""ghost"" attacking. Or they won't let their foot hang outside of the bed area or else something will pull them. I couldn't relate cause logically if there's ghost or monsters, why are they so immune to the blanket when they can just take it off and attack you?
Example 2 : People told me they felt panic when their mom asked to wait in line to pay while she go get something, and as the line moves pretty fast, people told me the panic is real cause their mom is not back yet to pay and it's close to their turn at the cashier. I couldn't relate to the panic feeling cause when my mom asked me to wait in line, and when it's my turn, I simply just say I'm sorry and that my mom is not here yet, so I just went back in line. What is there to panic about? Obviously you can't pay, so just go back.
And many other childhood things people typically experiences, I just couldn't relate. Everyone seems to bond really well when they talk about it. I feel really left out.
No one ever experienced the things I do in a different way of thinking too I guess.

60847,107650,"If a boy like the one in #107611 ever approached my daughter in that way, I might actually give him more consideration.
Am a long-term working Mum with a daughter in NUS.
She has faced her fair share of dating and it has been quite a disaster. Either the boy had differences or that she faced bouts of being cheated on.
Most of her boyfriends were found either in school or on a dating app. Just because those boys went via the so-called ""acceptable"" means to find a date, doesn't guarantee my approval nor did they treat my daughter properly.
As much as I don't know enough on this specific boy, I have never seen anyone in ages writing sincere. wholesome notes to others. It is such a nostalgic throwback to my time of dating. Everything being much simpler, face-to-face and genuine.
I may still feel sceptical on behalf of my daughter given he is still a total stranger. However, I would still support my daughter to consider him a try.
At least my daughter would have already seen and vibed the boy in real life. Not like on those silly dating apps where whatever you see on a ""profile"" is not necessarily what you get in real life.
A mother's instinct is unlikely to go wrong. I can at least sit right that he's more likely to treat my daughter better than what she has already faced.
PS: Unless you have a daughter, stop using the ""imagine xxx hit on your daughter"" to put others down. You are not a parent yourself. Don't speak on behalf of actual parents.

Why, then, is it completely ok the other way round? My guy friends are routinely dragged out by their partners or female friends for the sole purpose of being shopping bag carriers, drivers, and/or ATMs. We’re the de facto leftover food finishers whether we want to be or not. And no, not all guys are ok with cockroaches, nor do all of us have some innate DIY expertise, or whatever stereotypically “guy” thing we’re expected to do. Furthermore, asking these types of questions elicits banal responses like “who hurt you?” instead of any effort to understand.
Sure, some guys are ok with being “the guy”. But if there can be an expectation one way, then it should go the other way too. If not, then women can pay for and carry their own things, walk on any side of the road, and stomp their own darn pests.

All those drama you purposely got yourself into cause you're so pathetically bored with your life, you should leave all of it at once by then.
25 is a great time to start thinking about what matters in life. To be responsible, discipline, mature, and of course, a grown adult.
I don't care enough if you achieve certain things late, like graduating, marriage, first car, first house, first child, like say by the age of 35+. But 25 is where everyone needs to start take their life seriously. No more childish behaviour. No more drama. No more irresponsible behaviour.
If by the time you reach 60 but your mentality is the same as when you were 20, then all you did was grow old, and didn't grow up.
Stop being such an inconvenience to everyone else with that childish, dumb, irresponsible attitude of yours, especially when you're a grown adult.

I had a strong passion for computers and programming since my younger days and so CS was my natural first choice.
I decided to post here for the first time after interacting with several junior SWEs both fresh grads from CS and mid-career transitioners. Most if not all chose this field because of the high pay.
When I ask if they have any side projects, most don't have any. In fact, most of their time was spent on Leetcode and brushing up their interview skills on the hunt for their next job hop and pay increment. Some even have the cheek to insinuate I'm old and outdated as I don't know and have no interest in the latest Data Science, AI, machine learning stuff which they learned in school and I did not. As if DS AI MR are the only fields of CS...
In my time, the people who chose CS came from either of 2 camps, you could not make it to other courses or you have very strong passion for this field. Camp 1 nothing to say. But for those in Camp 2 like me, we were really different. We were motivated by the love of our passion and hobbies, money while important was never our top consideration.
