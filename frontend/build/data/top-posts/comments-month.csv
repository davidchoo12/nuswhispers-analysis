60903,107786,"How much should I give an unsupportive family?
27yo here who's about to start a first ft job. My pay is already well under median (4500) for a fresh grad from my course, and my parents expects me to give them an allowance of $1000 a month, approx 30% of my salary before CPF, inspired by my brother who's 23 and never has to pay for anything in his life including his uni and various hobbies unlike me, but he gives 100% of his internship allowance to them knowing they will happily take care of him.
My family is decently well to do, so money's not an issue for my parents. I'm obviously not the favorite child and am trying to save up quickly to move out, knowing that my parents will never be satisfied no matter how much I give them. I haven't even started work, and it's already ""Pay us allowance of $1000/month, or get out from the house and go rent a room for $1800 a month"". They know the housing market is messed up, and keep bemoaning that my room would be of better use ""rented out"". They're already chasing me to get out on a near daily basis, and it's clear they quickly want to burn bridges with me.
Here's why: My parents see me as an unfilial freeloader as I don't give them money at all -- I hustle and manage my money strictly, saving and investing (and reinvesting) nearly 80% of all the money I get from a few part time gigs into a few decently performing side businesses instead of giving them 100% of it like my brother. I haven't taken allowance from them since JC, I don't owe them anything, and quit clubbing when I was 18 to hustle and start my business, and have paid nearly 80% of my school loan off already working as a part time worker during my degree. I know that I can never rely on my parents to support me in any way, so I've got only myself to rely on, and I do not want to drag my girlfriend into this. Therefore I don't want to give them any money honestly, given that they've been less than supportive in my life.
To get advice for my situation, I'd like to ask here:
How should I deal with this impasse? When's the average age of moving out of the house? How much do fresh grads give their parents every month? And how does one remind their parents that it's their child, not a CPF (Child Paying for Family) retirement policy? 
Would appreciate some advice beyond ""suck thumb bruh, life's like that"" please! Thanks everyone.

I met this guy on a dating app and we hit off quite well. We really enjoy each other’s company and he seems to really care about me. After dating for around 4 months, he asked me to be his gf. However, i am not sure of my feelings for him, not because I don’t like him but because it is moving too fast. 
I told him not yet and he was quite annoyed. After asking for a few more times, he stopped. But we still go out quite frequently. 
One day, to my horror, when he was showing me something on his phone, I saw, on the notification bar, a girl name with some heart shaped emoji. I asked him who is that and he said it’s just a friend. I was not convinced but I try not to think too much about it. 
The following week, my friend told me she saw him and a girl at orchard road. She describes them behaving like a couple and I am sure there is something going on. I went to confront him about it and instead of apologizing for seeing another person, he blamed me for taking too long to decide if I want him. I was speechless and I told him I don’t want to see him anymore. 
I cried myself to sleep that night, a part of me wondered if my hesitation has caused him to cheat. But another part of me felt that if he really loved me, he would never have done that. He should have waited a bit more for me to be ready. But I was so confused and I felt so worthless because I can be so easily replaced. 
3 days later, he texted me to apologized about his words and actions. He invited me to the place where we had our first date and he told me I am the only one he loves and when he went out with the other girl, he was testing if he can have that same special feeling towards her. But he didn’t so, he ended things with her because he realized I am the one. He told me I hurt him when I did not agree to become his gf.
The date ended off quite well and I felt so happy that he is mine again. However, I am not sure if he can be trusted, but at the same time I don’t want to lose him again. 
I am very conflicted and I hope I can get some advice.

60873,107697,"Sorry long rant ahead. AITA for not wanting to pay for my mom’s new BTO? 
For context, I just recently graduated from NUS and is holding an average paying job of 5k a month. My mom is a single mom as my dad passed, and she has gotten a new BTO recently. She is working as an admin and earns about 3k monthly. As the sale proceeds of our current flat is not enough to cover the new flat, she wants me to top up the balance using my cpf as she thinks i’m capable since i’m working already. 
My mom has very traditional values. She didn’t explicitly say but is planning to give the house to my bro after he gets married as she feels is the male responsibility to provide a house for his wife. Similarly, she also expects my bf side to be able to provide a house for our marriage. However I told her this is not the case for Singapore as couples usually BTO. I have already successfully BTO-ed with my fiancé and is planning to save up to pay for my own house. 
She said i’m selfish for not offering my cpf to pay for her house but i told her it is not my responsibility to do so. It is also not my decision to buy a new house. I’m already giving her $800 a month as allowance, which i believe is higher than average as compared to the market given that she’s a single mom. But she still seems to be ungrateful and thinks that I SHOULD be giving her the money. 
Also, there are 2 rooms in the current house (3 room flat) so she gives one room to my bro and i share a room with her. I’m fine with it but my last straw was that she wants to invite my bro’s gf to move into his room while my bro is in the army, so that they can meet asap when my bro comes back from the army. My bro’s gf is not singaporean so she rents a room outside. I told her that this is unfair to me as i would like to have my own room as well, and she should offer the empty room to me to stay instead of his gf while he is in army. But she said since he is a boy he should have the room no matter what. 
After the whole fight she told me I am very selfish and told me to get out. I told her my BTO isn’t ready and my bf side also doesn’t have the conditions for me to move in. It’s so frustrating living together. 
Please let me know if I’m the asshole as she has already gaslighted me into thinking that I am one.

60922,107835,"Today is my daughter’s 10th birthday, and sadly she doesn’t even know I exist.
One year after graduation, I met this wonderful girl and we clicked instantly. It only took a few months before we’re together officially. 3 months after we got together, she got pregnant. 
Panicked and feeling totally unprepared to be a husband and father, I asked her to abort the baby. She said we could afford it and insisted on keeping it, and that led to numerous heated arguments that caused the breakdown of our relationship. I was torn, I didn’t want the baby, but I couldn’t bear to lose her, so I didn’t break up with her immediately. Selfish and young me thought of the things that I might need to give up if I were to have the child, like I could no longer travel and go out with friends as and when I wanted, I’d have no time and less money to spend on my hobbies, and my career progression might be delayed. Also, I was hesitant about marrying someone I only knew for a few months, not sure if we’re really compatible, if we both could live peacefully together and gave our baby a loving environment to grow up in. For months I was in denial that this is happening and was so consumed by my own worries and fears, I ended up being absent throughout her pregnancy and decided to break up with her when she was eight months pregnant. She still messaged me on the day she gave birth, saying she wanted me to see and hold our baby because she believed it will change my mind. But I chose to ignore her. 
A year later, a mutual friend attended my daughter’s birthday party and told me how adorable and smart she has grown, and all of a sudden I felt immensely guilty and regretful for not being there for my own child. So I attempted to reconnect with my ex, but she refused to meet me. She said I had never been there for her during her toughest days when she needed me the most, and I had never contributed a single cent, what’s the point of letting such a heartless and irresponsible person back into her life now? She said I’m as good as dead, and she and our baby were thriving and happier without me. She then blocked me everywhere. I even went to the extent of dropping by her place to find her, but her parents chased me away and said I’m a horrible person and they’d never accept me as part of their family.
Recently, I found out she is now happily married to a rich startup owner and has a pair of twins with him. Meanwhile, I’ve been on dating app for years and still haven’t found anyone that compares to her. I still remember vividly how comfortable and loved she made me feel, how we both were so happy just doing simple stuff together like cooking and watching shows. I can sense most of my dates are only after my money and don’t genuinely care about me. I’ve been progressing quickly in my career and enjoy comfortable salary, I have freedom to travel anywhere and money to buy anything I want, and I’m moving into my own place soon,  but I still feel so empty. Since my peers are mostly married with kids by now and busy with their own families, I barely have anyone to hang out with and I start yearning for a family of my own. Deep inside I feel perhaps I get bad karma for abandoning my partner and child 10 years ago. Perhaps the universe will never grant me another child and I will die alone, I guess I deserve it. I deeply regretted my decision back then and will live in guilt for the rest of my life. Each year on my daughter’s birthday, I will think of her and cry myself to sleep. How can you miss someone so much when you never even meet them?
To anyone dealing with unplanned pregnancy, I hope my story will enlighten you. Please make your decision wisely. Unless there are medical reasons, financial difficulties, or irreconcilable differences as a couple, please try your best to work things out with your partners, bring your child to this world and be there for them. 
Anyway, will just leave a note for my ex here since she was from NUS and may follow this page.
Dear A, 
I guess by now my apology won’t matter anymore, but I still want to say I’m very sorry. I should never have left you and our daughter and gave up on us. I’m glad you now have a big happy family that you’ve always wanted. I still care for you and our daughter and I really look up to you for being such a capable mother. If our paths ever cross
again and we are fated to be together again, maybe in another life, I promise to be a better man for you.
Love,
S

60902,107783,"I wanna know all of your thoughts about this. All of you, read this.
At the time of posting, there's a TikTok video that went viral about this couple in a car while they were on a drive thru, waiting for their food. 
So the bf was scrolling ig and happens that a pretty attractive woman's photo, possibly his old friend, appeared on his feed. Gf saw that, and asked, ""Why didn't you try to get her?"", to which he replies ""Cause I know I couldn't in the first place"". Gf then proceed to ask him to elaborate, to which he says ""Cause I know myself. I know my level. So I'm not interested to try"".
Apparently, this respond hurts the gf. The gf the says ""When you say that, you're saying that that woman is on such a high level that you couldn't get her. So which means you're saying I'm such a low level"". Bf then says ""No, that's not what I mean"". The conversation was cut when they got their food, and video ended there.
It went viral and so many people, typically women, be saying ""Omg your bf is such a red flag!!! You deserve better Queen!!!! You need to leave him!!! He doesn't appreciate you!!!"", and more similar comments. Because they went viral, the bf started to believe that maybe he's not right for her, thanks to the negative comments. He then peacefully broke up with her and requested the gifts he gave he to be returned to him. All those gifts were really expensive too. iPad, Air Pods, Marshall speaker, and many more expensive items. 
So what's your thoughts? 
Here's mine : The gf is at fault and wrong. 
I'm probably gonna be the only woman going against her, but I don't agree with her at all. Like first off, she asked the question, so expect getting the answer from his heart. I know she wants the bf to say things like ""Cause I already have you"" or ""You're way better than her"" or whatever sweet cringe bullshit. But instead, he gave out his deep truth, he says that she was out of his league, so he has self-awareness of his on level. Cause come on, in life, there's always, and I mean ALWAYS gonna be someone better than you. Some don't even have any self-awareness and acted like a douche and became a self-entitled piece of shit that believes they deserve better, when they don't even bring anything to the table (Looking at you, toxic modern feminist). So I respect the bf for speaking up on his insecurities.
But what did the gf do? Instead of understanding his point, she's making it all about her. Started questioning if she's a ""low level"" to him instead of thinking ""I see. That's understandable cause even I know there's guy out there that's way too high level for me to bother."" 0 understanding. She even recorded it and posted it on TikTok all for views, and that hurts and pressures the bf so bad, he blames himself for not being ""good enough"" for her and broke up with her. 
It's reportedly the guy has been a great bf. The gifts were one of the proofs. So what stupid reassurance and validation the gf need from him to say she higher level or not? It's not like the gf is any ""higher"" level, there's always gonna be someone else better but yet the bf chose her and committed to her. 
My husband and I had this conversation before and I wasn't mad at all. He is honest, and I know I'm not a supermodel kind. But the fact he chose me is the thing I will forever appreciate. Y'all who keep picking fights out of thin air and making it about yourself are nothing but losers like gooooooosssssh get a life ????????????????????????????????????????
If the situation was reversed, where the bf ask why don't she try to get a super hot popular tall rich friend of hers, and if she says ""Cause I know my level. He's out of my league"", the bf is expected to accept it as it is and not making any issues out of it. Cause if he makes an issue and show that he is insecure, suddenly he's toxic, he's a huge ""redflag"", he has ""small d*ick energy"" like whaaaaaaat ???????????????????????????????????????? Its wrong if men do it but it's okay if women do it. And women still cry about ""equality"" ????????????????????????????????????????
Then y'all wonder why no one wants you ????????????
Then y'all wonder why there's no more good men ????????????
Then y'all wonder why you're so lonely ????????????
This is why I will always be hated by women. I don't care if I'm a woman, but I will never support the idea of saying ""Men are always wrong"" or ""Men are evil"" from women. Look at yourself in the mirror and fix that shit first before you go and attack men. 
Get a life and touch some grass ????????????????????????????????????????

Tl;dr brother-in-law often does not respect boundaries and insists on paying for meals in a manner that's lacking discussion and respect for us.
My brother-in-law 45m often demonstrates a lack of respect for personal boundaries in various ways. For instance, he insists on paying for every meal we share, even though my wife and I would prefer to split the bill. Additionally, he often engages in preaching, using grand gestures and behaviors that he cannot consistently maintain.
Recently, I organized a birthday celebration for my wife and invited nine guests, including my brother-in-law. During lunch, he offered twice to pay for the meal. He even asked again as the meal was coming to an end, and my wife also declined. Despite my explicit request not to pay, he went ahead and paid the bill of $458 at the end of the meal.
I was pretty angry and frustrated and I refused to engage in conversation with him, walking off to my car and leaving a family chat group we share in case my anger got the better of me.
Later, my wife texted him and repaid the amount through a bank transfer after some discussion with him and without discussing my feelings with me.
Since that incident occurred a month ago, my brother-in-law has been acting as if he is oblivious to the situation, calling my wife daily for casual chats. Today, I reached a breaking point and asked my wife to stop enabling this charade. I'm unsure whether he feels guilty and calls daily to see if he will learn something or if he is simply oblivious to the impact of his actions.
A few years ago, he evicted my wife from his house because she fell in love with someone he didn't know (me, duh). This behavior was extremely egotistical and contradicted his supposed care for her (evicting someone for dating someone he doesn't know). Since then, our relationship with him has been strained, and he often treats us in a patronizing and condescending manner, as if we are socially inferior to him.
I need advice on how to manage this guy and navigate this challenging situation. His mom and wife haven picked his side and they're calling us names. Very immature.

I’m in a relationship with this guy (not sure if I should still call it one) for 3 months. Of course at first it’s all sweet and everything and he definitely will put in a lot of effort but once he got the girl, the effort to keep the relationship going declines. He would start to go missing for hours without telling me where he went. And when I asked, he would avoid the question. I even double texted or triple texted everytime (after a few hours of him not responding to my texts). I understand that he may be busy with work but using 3 seconds to reply wouldn’t bite a skin off? I’m not someone who is irrational who expects 24/7 replies but at least to let me know that he’s safe. 
That’s not only the root of the problem. He’s a conflict avoidant. Everytime when we quarreled, he will try to avoid whenever I try to talk things out. I just want to solve the problem, not to make things worse. When things had cooled down, I tried to discuss again but he would pretend that nothing had happened when I said I’m already OK from the situation and nothing is to be discussed about.
I was the only one initiating texts and outings every time. He would do that last time but now he doesn’t do it anymore until I initiated. To him, once weekly meet up is enough but to me, quality time is important. I’m tired of being the initiator and I no longer feel the importance of my presence in his life.
As someone (him) who has been in a few relationships, I expected him to be more mature and able to handle these situations better but unfortunately, he’s not. Recently, he asked to take a step back because he’s not ready for these problems and when I asked what does that mean, he never replied. I really wanted to make this work but at the same time, I don’t know whether I should hold on or break up.

Born in SG, studied and worked here. By all accounts I have a comfortable life e.g. 5Cs all got. But there is a nagging feeling of doom around the corner; like you know everything is too good to be true so there must be something bad coming. 
I've had friends say just live in the moment don't overthink things but then I feel if I don't make plans for the future then I wont be prepared for it. If I try making plans I feel the need to manage every contingency that it becomes super stressful. I then end up trying to processify everything and making it a repeatable task that requires minimal input and tweaking. 
For example I hate monitoring investments, but believe in the value of saving. So will spend a few months studying the market and landscape, investigate the options, choose some investments, make it monthly deducting and then just let it go on by itself with sporadic checks. If it goes up or down I don't feel anything as to me its a long-term investment so let it be. 
I then force myself to try and be contented with life i.e. stay in same house don't upgrade, deny some luxuries, don't change car very often. After a few months I will be like why am I not pushing myself to achieve and strive for higher things. But then when I start doing the math of deciding to take larger investments e.g. car, house I will be worrying about economic and job uncertainty and if sensible to make such large financial decisions in such volatile times. 
I feel I was more hardworking when I was younger and extremely driven in career and money making, then watching my bosses and colleagues I felt continuing to do so would be detrimental to having a happy family so switched track and tried to be more family focused. I love spending time with my kids and spouse, organizing family get togethers and stuff. But after that feel super drained and wonder if I actually made a difference e.g. won't the kids have had the same level of happiness if I just sent them to some play area with other kids? 
I just want to know if there are other people who feel the same way? Always double guessing yourself and wondering if you are doing the right thing. How do other people deal with it? Am I some neurotic case that needs help or normal?
P.S. None of this is said to make anyone feel bad, or judge others who do things differently.

60894,107747,"Hi all, in my late 20s now and with my current bf for a year plus or so and it’s getting really depressing. I don’t know why guys put in so much effort at the start only to act like this as the relationship progresses, literally only doing the bare minimum to keep the relationship alive. I have talked to him about this multiple times and it’s getting sooooo tiring. He always changes for awhile before reverting back to his usual self with work as an excuse. 
Question is should I break up with him? I feel like almost all the guys are like this and it’s also very tiring to change bf so many times. I’m so lost as to whether should I give him more time to change or should I just be decisive and break up with him? 
Guys if you see this and your girlfriend is complaining that you are not loving enough please take it seriously, maybe one day we will just give up and stop complaining and that’s it.

60882,107719,"There are 4 grades of parents. 
Grade 1a: supportive parents both financially and emotionally.This are kind of parents will pay for the children overseas or local education. They give their children freedom to explore, respectful of their children opinion, occasionally guiding them without being intrusive. They may also inject cash into the children start up or house.
Grade 1b. Emotionally supportive but unable to support financially as grade 1a parents
Grade 2: neutral parents. They don't demand excessive allowance nor do they offer much useful advice，but they do give children freedom to explore
Grade 3a: somewhat toxic parents. They occasionally demand excessive allowance and occasionally criticize you for whatever you do. You can never get up to the standard
Grade 3b: like grade 3a but more constant verbal abuse
Grade 4a: physically abusive parents. Coming home drunk and beating up the kids
Grade 4b: this group of parents is minority and may involve sexual abuse.
Most parents are going fall into group 2. Some group 1b and some group 3a. 
If you r lucky, you will have grade 1a parents.

60880,107711,"I hate my brother. Whenever he’s gaming, he would shout profanities and nonsense across the room. But when he is around girls, he pretends to be all gentleman-like, such as holding the door, taking the side road, and offering to cover the bill.
I know this because I often overheard him telling his gaming friends how regretful he would be after the date. He would say kinds of stuff like if the girl turns out to be pretty, it would at least make the meal worthwhile. Or if the girl isn't pretty, then she should be at least wealthy to take the bill. After which, he and his friends would try strategies on how to get the girl to pay next time to cut costs while still maintaining a gentleman-like appearance. Eeew.. I’m so offended that he’s my brother. I don’t want to be associated with someone like that.
And guess what..? He often rates his date with his friends like some ah pek sitting in the Kopitiam gossiping. Seriously.. I’m so embarrassed by him. Sometimes when my friends were over, they would tell me they could hear my brother's convo and complain about how uncouth they were and that they didn’t know guys were like that. I tried explaining not all are.. 
Sigh.. I guess I gotta resign to my fate having a brother like him. He’s not doing justice to the real man out there. I hope my future partner will be nothing like him. Guys.. Please make the world a better place and try, at least try..? not to be like that lah... Please? :(

There was this girl in my course that broke my relationship with my ex (I mean I do have some responsibility for not setting the appropriate boundaries). We hugged and kissed while I was still in the relationship, and after we broke up.
Only recently, she started to distance from me and started seeing other guys, who she claimed were normal friends to her.
What was alarming to me was that, she said that she wanted to hug and kiss me and claimed this was genuine, and yet said that she was not ready to commit into a relationship. Literally 10 mins ago from when I'm typing this, she told me to keep this myself in order to protect OUR image in school as we still had 2 more years.

60889,107737,"Should I ever call the police on my own brother? The arguments between my brother and dad is starting to get overboard to the point that both of them are about to get physical with each other soon and I dunno what will happen next. He has been out of job for 2 years, took a course in crypto coding kind of stuff to change jobs, and now cannot be bothered to get a job, everyday just leaching off parents at home, demanding for his meals and stuff, and giving a lot of stress to my parents. He has other selfish spoilt brat comparison tendencies such as always trying to make sure he orders more expensive food and having more than me each time we go restaurant as a family. My parents has been catering to him the whole time everyday and things havent been going well at home. Its getting to the point of too much on them and they are really tired of pampering this 37 year old grown ass at home who does not know how to cook his own meal at least, buy food and groceries for the family, boil water, do housework, or to make himself even the least useful for the family. He even steals my dad's credit card to buy his own games, even though he have his own savings from working 10 years ago. Each time my dad tries to tell him off to go and get a job, they will argue big time. My brother claims hes trying to build up by self learning things at home . But we dont see it. All of us sees that he totally cannot be bothered, everyday eat sleep and play games and has not even applied for a single job. Dad and brother has been having countless of arguments recently 
My brother has violent tendencies and cannot control himself when he gets mad, and since I was a kid and he had previously scratched and hit me over things when young, the scar on my chest still remains till now even 20 years later. And just now there was an argument over a small matter, brother got triggered because Dad told him off not to ask stupid questions regarding my aunt being in hospital now. And brother yelled at him first and not even respecting my dad. No doubt he got triggered but he doesnt even have basic respect for my dad and yelling at him was clearly wrong to begin with. And they argued really badly till the point that my brother had his fist up and looked as though he wanted to punch my dad. It was really scary and emotionally traumatising for me because I really dont want anything to happen. Now dad wants to stop buying lunch, cancel his card to prevent him stealing stuff, and stop tending to him already to teach him a lesson on basic respect, after the latest argument just now.
I told my parents I would really call the police if things goes overboard. Dad was okay with it, but mum strictly refused me to do anything of that sort and told me not to get involved. And that if I call the police it would ruin his currently already ruined state of life forever. But how am I supposed to not get involved if its going to end up punching or even knives next??
I have been really emotionally worn out over this on top of all this work stress that is still ongoing with colleagues and stuff, my workplace future and stuff. I am clinging on to this stressful job so tightly because I cannot afford to lose my job or anything in this family mess as I am the only one supporting the family. I really want to walk out of all this totally.

Strangely, till today, my friend is still wondering… what was all that about ? Did he find her so sexy and attractive and just want to have a different smash with someone new. My friend has been blinded by the passionate kiss definitely. The heart racing moment got her blindsided and till date, it remained a bittersweet memory for her.

60900,107776,"It's exhausting being the ""adult"" amongst everyone almost my whole life. A long read, but, please do read if you wish.
I really don't know how to rant here without making myself sound arrogant and a ""know it all"", I guess there's no other way. But I deserve to rant about this. I deserve a break.
I'm the youngest in my siblings, and the only boy. All of my older sisters are mentally special, if you know what I'm saying. Because of that, growing up, although I'm the youngest, I have to trained myself as if I'm the oldest brother instead. I have to look out for my older sisters all the time, cause they couldn't even rely on themselves, and they constantly got bullied from others cause of their condition. My parents always talk to me like an adult, teach me to use logical thinking and not emotions when it comes to problem solving, and generally just teach me how to be a mature individual, while also be smart. All my life, I've lived in survival mode. All for my sisters and parents' sake. There's no such thing as cartoons, or toys, or fun fair in my childhood. 
Both of my parents passed away due to an accident when I was 11 years old. All property and whatnot passed down to me by their final will (not sure how though). I divide some for my sisters just in case. I had no time to grieve them. I immediately think about what's next. Following my aunt's advice to invest, for me and my sister's future, and work part time anywhere at the same time, while also studying. I had to do all of this alone while making sure my sisters are safe. 
But growing up...those times I was in primary school, I suffered a lot. Dealing with kids, dealing with immature teenagers later on, with irresponsible immature teachers who always gets so emotional over the smallest, solvable things. I was labeled as an ""old man"" cause of the way I acted like an adult. I got discriminated cause apparently I'm so ""boring"" and ""too logical"". When I was 12, I remember I told other kids to stop being childish and immature. Yup, a kid, telling another kid, to stop being a kid. It's exhausting seeing them create problems cause they're so bored with their life. I was also told by the teachers that I'm ""too mature for your age"" and I need to start behaving like a kid, and I told them that they're incredibly immature for theirs and they should be an adult that kids look up too. I got myself in trouble for saying that, but, I stood my ground since I was already taught how to stand up for myself and argue with logics. Only the principle knows my real situation and dismissed the case. He told me that once I'm an adult, I'll be a lil happier.
Years passed, I'm now 30 years old. And....I'm still exhausted dealing with people. Bunch of adults my age still behaves like a child and always use their emotions for everything. They're irresponsible and never take any accountability in life. It's really exhausting to be dealing with people like this. 
I'm just...all I want is to be a kid. A kid that's so dumb and learning things very slowly. I deserve to be immature and stupid for once. I deserve to be the kid that I never was. I wish my older sisters are born normal so I can be that annoying little brother to them. I wish my parents are still alive too so I can have fights with them but also take care of them. At my age, if my sisters were normal, they would've been married and have kids, and I'd love to be that cool uncle to my niece and nephews...but I guess they'll be unmarried, and I guess I will be unmarried too. Cause I don't have the mental capacity to take care of another person, even worse if I have my own kids. I have 4 special sisters to look after, and that's my only life goal. I had to reject even my own crush....but my crush says she wants to go through it with me...but, with so many betrayals from both sides of my family about my parents' property, and about taking care of my sisters, I just...couldn't anymore. She say she'll wait for me....maybe, she's the one? But I don't know....for the first time, my logical mind couldn't do its thing. 
And for the first time, I grieved my parents and the childhood that I missed. And I'm crying right now as I'm typing this. I love my sisters. They didn't ask to be born that way. I never blamed them for taking my childhood away. I have no other choice but to do it for their sake. I could've abandoned them but , I chose to take responsibility.
Most of you have the life I wanted so bad.
Please don't take it for granted.

I don’t want to risk my reputation but here is my two cents about dialects.
Dialects allow you to appreciate your culture and traditions. It is one of the more effective ways you can connect with the past since language is not just a skill it is how you think.
That being said I don’t think connecting with one’s roots is as important as some people think it is. It is entirely possible for people to go about their entire lives without facing any practical challenges without knowing anything about your traditions. If you work your entire life as an programmer, I don’t think your traditions will ever be relevant. Some people put a lot of weight on this, whatever makes them happy. There is no requirement for any 21st century human to appreciate their own history if they don’t want to as long as you’re not lacking in scientific literacy and numeracy. 
My parents did not speak any other language other than English. They don’t celebrate CNY. We always travel over CNY holidays. I stopped using Chinese since after my higher Chinese O level many many years ago. I make a good living so evidently all the doom and gloom that people seem to think will happen if we abandon our roots did not affect my life one bit.
We are Singaporeans and we were founded on pragmatic values. There’s nothing wrong with your decisions as long as you make a good living. Ignore the haters.

60908,107795,"One of my best friends in my uni group claims to be serial thief - what should I do?
I've known her for just over a year - the kind of girl who is attractive, draws stares from guys and very fashionable. On top of that, she is a very good friend - the kind who will stay up and chat with you when you're feeling down, or makes you little trinkets and just someone who is always there for you.
During one of our HTHT sessions...she was rather high and suddenly she began talking and rambling about how she is a serial thief and honestly we were all shocked. Based on her family background, she is very well to do and honestly hearing this was like a bomb being dropped on us. 
She proceeds to tell us in detail how she commits all these and how it's impossible for her to get caught...and till now the stuff she stole is over 50k - multiple small thefts that added up over time. The way she described her MO was simply unbelievable...yet at the same, if you ever saw her, just because she is the last person you think to commit theft makes it all the more believable.
Our group fell silent after that and didn't know how to approach the topic with her after sending her home (yes she passed out afterwards). She never talked with us about that after the session and some of the girls speculated that she got that idea and imagined herself as the thief after watching something.

60931,107854,"On the recent posts of poor prospects of engineers in SG compared to tech, I'm curious to know why is everyone so fixated on only Singapore? Singapore is not the only place in the world where engineering jobs exist.
There are plenty of engineering positions worldwide. It's only natural with the small Singapore market, there can only be so many good high-paying jobs. If you want good pay as an engineer, go to US, Europe and Australia. If you want more exposure to emerging markets, try South America, Africa or even in the ASEAN region. 
If foreign talent have the guts to come to Singapore to work, why don't more Singaporeans just head overseas for better opportunities? While there is nothing wrong spending your entire work life in Singapore, be prepared to face a glass ceiling without international work experience. 
This is speaking from an engineer who has spent 20 years in top US and European semicon firms. After my NUS bachelors, I went for a masters in engineering in Europe followed by an MBA in the US a few years later. I have worked on large scale projects that you can never do in Singapore. I picked up multiple languages in the course of my international roles compared to most Singaporeans who can only speak English professionally.
After requesting a transfer back to SG for family reasons, my international exposure and experience is highly valued so I still draw an internationally-competitive remuneration.
Let me tell you all, the world is so much bigger than Singapore. Don't be limited to the mindset that Singapore is the only option. If you want to pursue the career you are passionate in but Singapore companies don't pay what you think you deserve, bite the bullet and head overseas. Higher risk but higher rewards. With an NUS education, the world as your oyster.

60872,107696,"I am thinking of dating and trying the apps actually. I was looking at the profiles on my friend's app (showed my quite a lot of the profiles over a few weeks). 
I realised that most of the girls minimally drink socially. 
I never drank before and I have my reasons.
There were only 2 girls that explicitly said that they didn't drink in their profile and I wouldn't really swipe them right. 
Every single girl that I am liked or really liked (based on both pics and the profile description) almost always have drinking explicitly put in their profile. Also, it is really weird this is the case because I know sometimes girls don't write anything about drinking. 
Is there something I am attracted to that these girls have in common (obviously, other than drinking)? I cannot pinpoint anything :( 
Anyone have any idea?
Just wondering if majority of the girls are like that and if I am going to be single for the rest of my life.

If you’ve decided to commit yourself to your partner, then stick thru thick and thin. Temptation is always there, and feelings fade, but for what you standby shall not.
What constitutes cheating? Imo emotional is worst off than physical. I’m not interested in being a third party in someone’s rs. So even if you have no respect for others, please have some respect for yourself. If you can’t be with the person at their worse, you don’t deserve their best.

60909,107812,"Long read. Bear with me.
TLDR: What key element promotes a healthy, happy & longevity marriage?
When we were younger, perhaps in our teens age, we often fell in love with nontangible substances and often by impulse. It could be lust or physical attribute but rarely anything material since we have yet to experience adulthood and realise the importance/impact of financial literacy/ stability.
As we get older, maybe when we get into our first higher education or begin our first part time/full-time job, we pay more notice to tangible items and maybe get hooked up to the idea that our romantic partner has to acquire/ achieve a certain level of financial status & physical attributes to match our checklist of what our future potential spouse should be.
But wealth can vanish overnight, and physical attributes dissipate over time. And when this superficial stuff is gone, which is what you value at the start of the relationship, then will you still choose to be with that person? Or would you stick to it but regret it every day in your life? Or would you walk out of it? 
That aside, if we throw all these ideas away and imagine if we are stranded on an island where only survival matters and none of these tangible stuff matters, then what would you value? Would it still be the physical attributes of an individual, how much their bank carries, or what other layers beneath the surface of all these superficial stuff will you look at?
Many people say a romantic relationship and marriage are two very different things. In a relationship, people may value surface stuff usually based on first impressions that is the tangible items mentioned above. In a marriage, beyond the tangible stuff, they look into the compatibility of lifestyle, not two individuals but two families, as we are shaped by our environment/ upbringing of our family. 
Then 10/20 years down the road of a marriage, the idea of the very initial phase of butterflies in the stomach becomes so strange and unfamiliar to us that we forget how that even felt like. Many old couples said such a relationship is mundane and boring, similar to how you start your day by reading a newspaper, sipping your coffee and carrying on your day with your work. There is no excitement. But some say it makes them very fulfilled, while some lament why they even chose to start this journey.
So my question to you is: what do you value in a relationship? What do you want from a relationship? Why do you want a relationship? And what do you think is the key element to a healthy, happy and longevity relationship?

60899,107766,"Hi Dr Rajesh and Prof Ben, I seek your advice on a switch to either tech or finance. Should I sacrifice my passion for pay?
I work as an embedded engineer in an electronics firm since I graduated from EE 3 years ago. My starting pay was low compared to my friends who went to tech or finance but I thought I could work hard to close that gap as I like embedded. Even after a recent promotion, fresh grads in tech today earn more than me.
I tried switching companies but they can't offer significantly more. The payscale of this industry is what it is. Career progression for embedded seems bleak.
I'm considering improving my programming skills by doing leetcode and picking up AI stuff to switch away from embedded as I only know C and rudimentary Python. What do you think of this plan? Or should I just head to finance as many of my friends did?

60925,107840,"Recently my friend who graduated with a ""science"" degree from NUS complained out of the blue that she couldn't find any job, so I suggested why don't she just apply to become a maid. There are many maid agencies around. She looked at me like as if I had just insulted her (she actually did that to herself by taking a life science degree to begin with).
Then, an epiphany dawned on me: if this so-called maid ""job"" is so terribly insulting and that it's ""unfit for locals"" to do, isn't it really the case that the living conditions and salary for maids is just underpaid by our own standards? It's not at all a shortage of labor that we need to find desperate foreigners to do these jobs; we are literally offering these jobs beneath our own standards to begin with, is that not literally human exploitation? It's ""basically slavery"" if we pay them ""basically nothing"". Would you think it's okay for you or your daughter to work 16 hours a day with half a day off on Sunday for 500 mighty Singapore dollars a month? What makes Singaporeans so special that they can treat other human beings as being fine to do these jobs that aren't fine for any local to do? 
All my ""maid-owner"" acquaintances are the kind unreasonable person you wish didn't exist in this world. The selfish, self-centered and inconsiderate kind of person. (Maybe that's too anecdotal, but whatever.) They always complain about their maids being lazy - oh the irony! And think it fit to scold or punish ""their"" maids in some spiteful way to ""make them learn"". I'm sick of hearing it. I've told them off multiple times but as I said earlier, maid-owners just can't be reasoned with. Im a veteran in these arguments and have learnt to flawlessly defeat their logic in even a way they can understand. They always end up hunkering down on ""shaddap"" and that it's their right to own a maid - mind your own business!
Go mind your own business.

Without revealing too much, he's in the service industry, we have seen each other for over 3 years before he started talking to me and asking for my number. Before that, We just said hi and smiled. We have been texting but haven't managed to hang out cos he only has 2 off days in a month and its hard to get a common free day.

I don't mean software engineering as that is hardly engineering at all. I refer to core engineering branches like electrical, civil, mechanical and chemical.
These core engineering majors have been a dumping ground for years and I admit I'm one of those which is why I ended up in EE. Call it acquired taste but I grew to like this field. I'm not keen in software or finance careers that many of my engineering seniors have gone to.
I'm in my final year and planning my career options. I read from surveys that the starting pay for engineers is very low in SG and it sorts of dooms your entire career as I understand every pay is built on what you earned previously. I hope leaving the engineering field we trained and suffered so hard in school for is not the only way for engineers to get a good pay.
Short of heading overseas, what good career options are there in engineering that still pays reasonably close to software or finance?

60888,107732,"I indirectly cause someone's life to end. And I have 0 regrets.
This happened about 15 years ago and, before I moved in to Singapore. I won't say which country I was in but it's definitely the neighbouring country, and most like you can guess which. 
Very important info for this story : I'm a snitch. Like a heavy, professional snitch. It doesn't matter how small or insignificant it is, if it's wrong, againts the rules or law, or simply immoral, I will snitch on you. I snitched on my friends cheating in exam, people recording in cinema, my friend cheating on his gf, etc. I never get caught, cause that's how good I am at snitching. So I will never get those stitches. As for why I snitch? For fun. I simply feel joy seeing people's plan got ruined for breaking the rules. It's a guilty pleasure that I couldn't explain. 
So when I was in university, my bestfriend invited me to study together with his friends for our finals. So I agreed, but I've never been to his friends' place before. When we reached there, I was shocked. They were doing drugs in their house. Ketamine, heroin, meth, you name it. I only know it cause I studied these things in my course. What's dissapointing is that my bestfriend is involved and also doing drugs and deal with them too. I was extremely uncomfortable and dissapointed finding out about this. 
I played it cool and act chill. After awhile, I pretended to have a phone call and told my bestfriend and his friends that I got to go back. They were so into the drugs that they barely even responded to me nor notice me. I went back home, took a heavy shower. And started my plan to snitch on them. 
I put on some gloves to prevent my fingerprints being exposed, wrote down the address of their home, with a small note saying there's something suspicious there, in a different writing style than mine so no one will know it's me. Wore my medical mask, and prop glasses, went to the police station, and I pretended to give one of the police something they ""dropped"" behind, which was the paper I printed. Once he took it, I immediately walked away as the police got distracted reading the paper I gave. I then simply went back home and sleep. 
The next day, I went for my finals but noticed my bestfriend isn't present. Night falls, I decided to go to his house to check. But he's not there. His parents was there and invited me inside. They told me everything that happened from last night till afternoon on that day. 
Apparently police raided the house I gave the address to while they were still on drugs. They got caught, and sent to jail. I asked my bestfriend's parents how did the police know, and they say the police ""received a paper printed with the address of the house, from a stranger"". Apparently, police didn't bother to investigate who sent that paper, they simply look at this person as a form of harmless vigilante.
But here's what shocked me. After few days, my bestfriend's friends got the death sentence for owning those drugs. But my bestfriend only got jail time for decades since he doesn't own the drugs but consume it. I'm not sure about how the technicality of the laws work really. But, 3 people's life ended, and 1 got decades of jail time, all because of me. 
I regularly visited my bestfriend in jail before and he said he regretted everything about drugs. But what he doesn't know, is that I did this to him and his friends. His parents spent so much money on some legal stuff to lower the punishment. They managed, but, it was only lowered by few years. 
I still couldn't believe that I indirectly cause someone's life to end and made one of them stay in jail for so long. But, I have no regrets. Laws are laws. I don't discriminate :) 
You don't want to get in trouble, then simply don't break the law :) 
Have a nice day everyone :)

60871,107695,"This is my series of misadventures I went back to school today to complete some errands but it was raining very heavily. Once I got off the bus, I tried to ran across the traffic light to SDE as I didn’t bring an umbrella, but I accidentally stomped into a puddle of water and my new airforce shoes and socks were all drenched. 
I was very hesitant whether to take off my shoes and socks as I did not bring an extra pair of slippers and I would have to walk barefoot around for the whole day, but eventually I just went ahead to remove my shoes and socks as it was getting increasingly uncomfortable for my feet as I was walking around school. But that was the worst mistake I have ever made. I had to leave my shoes at a random corner as I did not want to carry it around while I was going around, but I did not see it was near a slope that had soil water dripping down so when I came back, my white shoes were completely destroyed. But that wasn’t the worst, as I was walking around, people were all staring at me and someone accidentally stepped on my toes without even apologising, as a guy I was really very humiliated. 
As I was about to leave school, I went to the toilet as I was having a bad stomachache, but the scene at the male toilet really made me wanna cry, the floors were wet and dirty from people’s shoeprints from the rain and some of the cubicles had shit on the floor. I wanted to leave but I couldn’t hold much longer so I just went ahead, but when I wanted to sit down, I felt something underneath my foot and when I looked I actually stepped on what looks like a pile of mud or shit barefooted, I was so disgusted but there were no place for me to wash them so I had to finish my business and walk out of the toilet to wash my feet in the rain.
At this point, I was so done at the series of bad luck I could have within a few hours just because of the rain and my bad decision of going barefooted. My feet were so dirty and it was hurting so much from all the small rocks I accidentally stepped on. I just went to take my destroyed shoes and socks and just booked a grab to go home. What a miserable day and I just needed to get this off my chest.
