60950,107890,"Hi all, I’m looking for some advice because I’m really stressed about this. Me (f) and my bf (m) have been dating for more than 3 years, but we’ve never smash before. 
We initially didn’t do it cuz we were very worried that I’ll get pregnant if the condom breaks/pill doesn’t work what not. So my bf said the best way is just not doing it at all. 
Before you guys start, I do believe my bf is physically attracted to me, we’ve done some physical stuff but just didn’t reach like the smashing prt yet that’s all. He’s also very physically affectionate with me, would always hug/kiss me that kind of thing.
I’ve been trying to convince him to at least do it once or twice. Now with modern inventions I believe we can be very careful but he just won’t budge.
I feel very morally dispirited and it has caused me to question if maybe I’m just not what he wants in a partner. I’m not looking to find another guy to smash or that kind of thing, but could anyone please give me some advice for this?
Thanks in advance.

60934,107857,"Anything I need to know before marrying a Malaysian?
She is from JB and went to RGS when she was 13. Before that she went to several international schools all over the ASEAN region. NUS Med. I’m NUS Med too. Accent is indistinguishable from any Singaporean I know. Maybe a bit too atas but I don’t know if it’s because of RGS or because she’s from a really rich family in JB. Also my father is a taxi driver so I’m not exactly in her class. 
Her father owns 80% of a listco in Malaysia. Yet, very humble (almost cheap) family. Her father drives a 20-year-old Camry and refuses to buy a new car before his current one breaks. He does go all out in certain things, particularly education of his children and real estate. She has a paid-off 3-room condo to her name in Holland Village that her father bought for her. My girlfriend is also cheap. She thinks traveling for leisure is a waste of money, thinks Starbucks is a waste of money etc. Every time I meet her she would find a way to say something is a waste of money. I don’t mind this I’m poor anyway, but I would like to elevate my standard of living and I would like to travel for leisure one day.
My impression is Singaporeans have no conflict with Malaysians because we’re essentially the same culture but I also know this girl and her family enough to say that they are nothing like ordinary Malaysians. They speak only English at home, no religion, and they believe strongly in independence of women. Her father has spoken to me about marriage and he wants me to know that for banquet and wedding expenses, I don’t have to worry because what can be halved will be halved and for banquet he will pay for his own guests and only his own guests.  
My family on the other hand is conservative and my mom is very “Chinese.” Still places importance in Chinese culture and wants grandchildren very much. My girlfriend’s family has pretty much abandoned their Chinese culture (they don’t celebrate CNY for example). She also has no plans to have children early or at all.
The children issue is perhaps the main source of friction but I am lukewarm about having kids as well so I think I’d be able to ignore my mom. Other than that, my trepidation is in the disparity of socioeconomic class, which I am not socialized well enough to understand the issues that it could bring.
Trying to get some last thoughts. Greatly appreciated.

60980,107953,"I have graduated from NUS for a number of years now. Most of my friends/peers are now married. I cannot help but fall into this toxic mentality when I look at their social media. Going on long holidays in faraway places, driving out for dates to fancy places, in their tiny long wallet and beautiful trendy get up, 3 bedroom condo as matrimonial house. And here I am eating cup noodles and vegetable rice with my boyfriend, bringing an umbrella in my bag wherever we go because we either walk or cycle to date places. I am envious, I want to dress up and look pretty and go to fancy places too. This makes me wonder what did I do wrong to not have that kind of cushy lifestyle? I am reasonably smart and beautiful. I am earning a decent salary now and can afford my own car and rental. Back in university days there were guys interested in me and I have been in relationships before. I know I shouldnt compare but I really can't help it. Am I expecting too much?

60953,107898,"What kind I actually expect from a girl in a relationship? This is a genuine question. I am all for woman empowerment. Women have the right to enjoy life and be successful. In the past, females would do household chores, take of children, cook, etc. whereas the guys would do the earning, in charge of protecting the family, etc.. Now, everyone says that it is suppose to be 50-50 so everything is split and I am totally all for this. However, it honestly doesn't feel that way.
I am going to generalise a little here based on my friends, what I read and my own personal experience so don't get offended. LOL.
In general, in the courting stage, personally I feel that guys have to do more work - pay for first date, try to impress the girl, plan for the dates, must tolerate the girls bs (some girls literally put that on their dating profile), have to be more successful in career (yeah, even successful girls seem to want someone who is equally or more successful than them), still do the protecting, etc. Girls don't need to plan for dates, just come to the date and expect the guy to carry the conversation (not all girls like that but a lot of them are), expect guy to be humorous (when they are not humorous themselves), etc. The worst thing is that sometimes they complain about the date or complain about the conversation flow without putting any effort into the date or conversation. The best part is that are expecting me to guess what kind of date they want by doing mind-reading. 
In the steady relationship stage, guys still do more work, still planning dates, planning and spending for special occasions, etc. When a guy's planned date goes horribly wrong, it is my fault. Everything is my fault. Earth is a sphere, yes, it is my fault that it isn't cube. Just kidding.
I am in a relationship and I have to put in a lot of effort to maintain it. The worst part is that a lot of the effort goes unseen. I understand that it isn't going to be even but I don't feel like my partner is putting much at all. One day, I asked my gf if she can try a more sexier style for me and she said no. I asked maybe just wear for dates (not change your style everyday) and she downright said no and said that I was objectifying woman. I am a visual person and I have preferences but if she is uncomfortable, then I told her that I won't force her and I backed off. I asked if we can try some spicy stuff in bed and she said no. Fine, I backed off again. I asked her if she could do some planning for dates as I was really busy with work. Her dates were bare minimum effort and weren't thoughtful about me but in her mind, they were amazing. After a few months, she was complaining to her friends that she didn't feel like a priority to me, so I started to plan again while juggling my stressful work. 
Planning a date while having 9 to 5 job is way different from having to plan a date while doing OT till 9pm almost everyday. 
Barbie is my gf's favourite character like ever. Normally, I would tell her to watch with her friends and she would be fine with it.  Since it was her fav character, she wanted to watch with me. I was really not interested in watching the movie. I wanted to watch Oppenheimer with my friends. She said that I valued my friends more than her because I am choosing my friends instead. So I have to make the sacrifice.
The best part in all of this was this particular dinner. I was having dinner with her family. First, she complained that I was dressed sloppily. To me, I already met her parents a lot of times so I wanted to wear something casual and comfortable. So I am not allowed to comment on her style while she can control mine. Then, I blabbered something to her parents (something about her work) which she told me not to tell them. It was a honest mistake and I apologized to her. She said that I cannot keep secret and needed to think about our relationship, basically, considering breaking up with me. I am not going to downplay my actions, yes I hurt her and it wasn't right but considering breakup....seriously?
I have made so much more sacrifices for her than her and I put in way more effort than her. Girls expect guys to be successful in our career but complain that we don't put in time for our relationship. Now, she can just break up with me and all the years of effort becomes nothing instantly. 
In summary,
I cannot ask her to dress in a certain way for me or I cannot ask her to try spicy things in bed because I am a pervert and misogynist. I cannot ask her to plan or put in effort for dates or conversations. I cannot ask her to plan Valentine's day for me instead because traditionally, guys are suppose to be the ones doing and all her friends have awesome dates planned by guys. I thought we threw traditions away and replaced it with equality? Basically, I feel as though they choose everything that is beneficial for them and ignore everything that is non-beneficial for them. 
I just want to know exactly what guys can ask or expect from a girl to contribute in a relationship? What is their role in a relationship?

60970,107929,"AITA? Do I really deserve this treatment?
I hope you all can help me understand. It's a long one, but I appreciate it if you read till the end.  Will do my best to keep it as short as I can. 
I used to be close to this person (I'll call her Manda for reference) and she was one of my close friend for years. Not sure if it's important, but, I'm a guy. And no, Manda is not my crush, or gf, or more. Just a very close friend, pure platonic.
In 2016, Manda excitingly told me a great news about her studying in the UK. Thing is, I was excited, but, at that time when she told me, lots of bad things happened to me. My university struggles, my toxic family problems, financial issues, and my pet nearly passed away and I struggled to find the money to bring my pet to the vet, etc. So my response towards her news isn't exactly the best, but, I didn't react that bad. All I said was ""That's really great"". She tried to keep the excitement, to which I responded ""That's good"". I then told her ""Listen, I'm happy for you, I really am, but, I need some time alone for a bit. So much bad things going on with me now.. I'm sorry. I hope you understand..I am happy for you, but, I'll get back to you about this as soon as I can"". She didn't reply after that. 
Days, turned to weeks, everytime I texted her about her day, or anything to do with her studies, she gave me the cold shoulder. She responded harshly and sarcastically. Mind you that I don't understand social cues as fast as anyone. But when I noticed the passive-aggressive response, I asked her, ""Did I do anything wrong?"" to which she said ""Oh. Refer back to the text when I told you the great news of me going to the UK"". So I did and... I still don't see anything wrong really. 
She then said ""I was so excited to tell you the news, you were the first one I told,  and yet, that's your response? You were being rude and you hurt me a lot."" I'm still...confused. I then asked her ""Just because of that? I mean...why didn't you tell me before? It's a small thing, we could've talk...I did told you bad things were happening to me, but, I didn't say I wasn't happy for you though"". She then generally just lash out on me. Saying I'm not a good friend, saying that I'm a horrible person.
I begged her to meet up, or at least talk to me about this, but she refused. There's still many bad things happening to me that time and I don't understand why she wants to add more...she doesn't even bother asking me what I was going through...yet, I apologized to her, I said its my fault, I was begging so hard, but she decided to ignore me all the way. She decided to cut me off. Months passed, and she still ignores me. 
The day comes when she's gonna fly to the UK, and I found out one of her bestfriend couldn't make it, which made Manda sad. I contacted her bestfriend and planned on something crazy, to which her bestfriend agreed. That day, in the morning, I drove all the way to Melaka, Malaysia, picked Manda's bestfriend up, and drove all the way back to Singapore. At the airport, I was scared to see Manda cause of the tension we had. Right before her flight, everyone gathered (but not me, I was a lil hidden while keeping distance), and Manda was so surprised to see her bestfriend present that day. Her bestfriend said ""Oh, it's all thanks to him (me). He drove all the way to pick me up so I could see you"". Manda...didn't say a word about it. She saw me, but she didn't bother saying hello or...anything...not even a smile. She was just with everyone else. Hours later, she flew to the UK. I didn't get to say goodbye... I then send Manda's bestfriend back to Melaka, and drove all the way back to Singapore.
Days later, Manda blocked me everywhere, and I found out she had been bad mouthing me to everyone. No one believed her description about how bad I am to her, but still...why would she do that...I cried and cried for months, wondering what exactly did I do so bad...
7 years passed, her bestfriend got married recently, and invited me. I went in the wedding hall, and...I saw Manda. She saw me, rolled her eyes, and walked to a different direction. I immediately just leave a gift for her bestfriend, took one photo, and walked away from the hall. I didn't eat anything there. As I reached home, I cried till my heart feels like stopping. 
What exactly do I do wrong...please be honest with me...do I deserve to be punished this way...I have apologized, I even tried to make it up to Manda by driving all the way to pick her bestfriend up to see her on her day to fly to the UK...is that effort not enough? In the past, Manda can hurt me so much, but I always forgive her and give her the chance to talk...why is it when I do it one time, I'm the bad guy? 
If you read all the way, thank you for your time. Please do tell me if I'm the one who messed up..please let me learn..

60971,107931,"So I am an ugly guy. People have said I am a 0 or even a -100 to my face and yes, this includes both gender. I am kind of low in terms of intellect. I barely scrape through things by putting my life and soul into studying my entire life. Most people can absorb things way faster than me. I somehow managed to graduate. 
I was bullied a lot in school because of how I looked and how stupid I was. 
Due to this, I talk very little, almost only if neccessary, and I have no friends till this day. I basically stay invisible where ever I go. I am actually quite scared of people, especially if they are really good looking or smart because they say the most hurtful things.
I have to work at least 3x harder than my colleagues to do the same thing at work. I am slower than everyonem People talk behind my back and I have accidentally seen their whatsapp messages about me. They dont outright bully me so at least I am happy about that. 
I met a colleague who was nice to me whenever we talked. She was kind so I really liked her. I helped her when she got stuck as she was new. She was really beautiful too. I thought maybe something good was going to happen, like maybe I get something good in my life after all the suffering. In the end, I found out that she got into a relationship with a handsome and rich guy. I felt I was pranked by heaven and so stupid to think that a beautiful girl would even like me. 
I tried dating apps and even some dating events. My requirement is basically anyone who can accept me. I dont care if the person is ugly, not smart or poor. I do wish the person is a little kind and doesnt hurt me. I got insulted and even gotten disgusted looks on events. Also, no swipes on apps unless it is a bot. 
I dont drink alcohol, gamble or participate in any vice activities. Contrary to what everyone thinks, I dont play computer games or even watch porn. I like painting - like on canvas, scultpures and other stuff. My painting skills suck but I like doing it because I feel at peace stroking the brush and there is no one there to hurt me.
I do get jealous when I see people my age having gf, wives, hanging out with friends or even just enjoying simple things like drinking together. 
I keep reading that everyone has a purpose on this earth. I really cannot think of anything for me. I am pretty much horrible at everything. I just wish I knew why I was even created.

It makes me question about my existence. How do I get rid of this feeling? I just feel genetics is really unfair, why did Darwin made it this way?

60957,107907,"how do you approach a colleague who owes you lunch money? 
I have been lunching with colleagues and sometimes involved me footing for the bill first at a restaurant / cafe. While this not usually often, we do treat ourselves at nicer casual restaurants/ cafes at times for a great catch up during lunch.
We all take turns to pay usually - and when I say “We” they are not the same people most of the time, hence the “need” to hang out at better places to have a better ambience to chat. I will usually check how much is my share, and immediately paynow or return cash to the paying colleague (incl of the taxes).
However when it is my turn to pay, I do get episodes of colleagues forgetting to pay me back, and I believe they are genuine, because of busy schedules they forget as they did mention they would do so “later”.
To put the situation into a better context, we are all middle aged adults drawing an average of 5-fig salary, but to me it is still money - though the bill can range between $15-$25. And because we are all adults of certain level and payscale, it seems (very) petty enough of me to ask them about the owed lunch money, worse still we dont really meet daily. I guess it definitely isn’t an issue if I were to say it was a treat from me, but no it’s an AA go-dutch lunch. And I cannot be consoling myself to forget it - take it as a treat when clearly it was not.
How will you approach for someone to pay you back in such a situation? While it can be deemed a small amount, it definitely is not , especially if this happens more than once, and it is also a matter of principle when it comes to such.

60975,107939,"Having good looks is a curse.
I know, npnt. 
I'm being told that I'm pretty all my life. I'm blessed with height and am also slim built with an ample bosom. Tbh, I don't see what others see in the mirror. I'm just me. I'm an introvert so I don't open up easily unless I've spent time knowing a person. I don't socialise a lot too. I always try to blend in but shit always seem to happen.
In pri and sec school I was bullied so much by other girls. When I reached the age when boys started to notice me, it got worse. I get prank calls from boys asking me to be their gf and their current gf would gang up with others to confront me and make my life hell. Once they even threw my school bag into the boys toilet, vandalized my desk, drew on my uniform. I was so afraid of going to school and couldn't focus in class. I dreaded being approached by anyone especially boys who wanted to get to know me. It's very uncomfortable when people keep staring at your chest instead of looking you in the eye when talking. I feel like a piece of meat. I mostly wear baggy clothes from then on.
When I thought those days were over, jc and uni aren't better. I thought I made some friends only to overhear them telling others they just wanted to know what's the fuss about me. Said I'm just some stupid flower pot plus other very mean and hurtful things about me. So basically they weren't really my friends. I started to keep to myself even more.
I finally entered the workforce and unknowingly dated a married man for a few months. I ended the relationship when I found out. He didn't wear a wedding ring so I assumed he's single. How stupid of me. I've also dated a guy who actually have a gf and I only discovered it much later. I was so broken after that. Whenever someone tried to ask me out again I just said no. I thought of trying dating apps but I fear it's worse.
All that talk about looks. Sometimes it's a curse for some people you know? You wonder if the person is really interested in getting to know you or is just desire or lust. 
I had a crush a guy recently and I think he noticed, he told me he finds me intimidating to be with. What does that even mean? How much of myself should I change to have a guy who is willing to look past my physical appearance and treat me like a normal person? I also want an authentic love with an authentic guy.

He might have talked to them but the chats were mostly normal unless he was trying to date them which are old chats. He admitted that it might not sit well with me but he wanted me to let him do it. He said he will stop and restrict to girls I am ok with if I dont agree with him.
On one hand, I find it extremely weird, especially when we actually meet these girls as friends.

And told someone else a different story. Now this has come to a point that it is affected my functioning because it was actually the first time with a guy, and he took my virginity. Now it's affecting my functioning abilities and I'm having really bad thoughts and Idk why this is happening to me and always am thinking to self-destructing or negative thoughts in general. I can't look past why he did this to me or why this type of people exist in general, though they are all around us and worse of all why did it happen it me? Pls help me on this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.????

No you cannot invest your way into landed property.
People who can afford a landed property have high income. The ballpark is 500k annual income with a gearing ratio of ten for a terrace of 5 million.
No investment is able to earn 8% on a consistent basis. The historical s&p is historical. 
There is no shortcut.
Most of your investment on the long term basis will be 4-6% per annum. If you got tricked into crypto or ILP then lesser. Anyway most guys that r exposed to Chinese tech suffered losses too.
No You won’t able to retire early.
You always need your day job. To earn big bucks, you need to set up your own company. But that comes with risk
If you do not want to assume high risk, then the best way is to work hard and earn a high income.

60990,107971,"Dear NUS management. I am a staff. Why are we going backwards with hybrid work arrangements. The recent circulars state we have to work on-site 4days per week and get to work off site once a week. While I know students are back in School, why can we retain the current hybrid arrangements which has proven to work? Some would want to return to office daily while some prefer more days WFH. Ultimately, we can strike a balance. Academic staff don't exactly have a fixed working hours unlike us E&A staff and so if this new policy was because of fairness, I don't think it is. My physical and mental health has improved drastically with hybrid work. I exercise most of the days I get to WFH as I can just immediately head out the moment work ends. Now with this new policy, it just seems like I've to just go back to my old unhealthy routine where I come home from work so late I can't even think of exercise or spend time with family.

60999,107996,"All this talk about who pays on first dates... Aiya, here's a summarized guide to end this discourse once and for all.
Regardless of who invites who,
Scenario A: The guy offers to pay for both.
- If the girl doesn't offer and insist to pay for herself, then you know you dodged a bullet.
- If the girl allows you to pay but doesn't treat you on a second date, or worse still, knowing that she doesn't want to see you again, she still allows you to pay, then you know you dodged a huge bullet.
- If the girl allows you to pay, thanks you, and tells you she would treat you on a second date and backs it up with actions, she's a keeper, don't let her go.
Scenario B: Both people pays for their own part.
- If the girl looks and shows signs of displeasure or disinterest right after this happens, you know she's expecting you to pay from the start. Bullet dodged, don't ask her out again.
- If not, and if the girl follows up with an activity to do or a place to check out, then it's alright, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either.
Scenario C: The girl offers to pay for both.
- If this happens, as a decent human being, offer to pay for yourself, and insist on it. If she insists to pay for you, make sure to pay for the second date. You got a keeper, don't let her go.
- If you let her pay without offering, then bro what you doing, you can do better. Not surprising if she doesn't want to see you again after.
Flip the genders around for all scenarios, it applies regardless. No double standards.
Best way to handle things? Each person pays for themselves on the date, with no expectations to have a free treat whatsoever. If you want to impress the girl/guy by paying for them, then go ahead, but risk potentially getting taken advantaged of for a free meal, and your precious time and energy especially if you ask them out again.
At the end of the day, if the girl/guy likes you for who you are, there wouldn't even be an expectation for you to pay for their meal, regardless of how cheap or expensive the meal is, or whoever invited who.
Would you be happy going on dates with self-entitled girls who expect you to pay for them? There're better girls out there! (or guy if you're a girl and like guys) :p

61008,108019,"A very controversial question but, a genuine one really. This is really sensitive but, it's just my own views and I'd like to see different thoughts. 
Okay, so, you know those cancer patients that need to shave their head? It's unfortunate and I do feel sad for them. But, I saw bunch of videos where the patient's friends or family also shave their own heads in order to support or make them feel like they are not alone. 
I know for most people, it's heartwarming, and I can see it in that angle. But... On my angle, those healthy people who shave their own heads to show support, don't really do it for support of the cancer patient, rather, it's all for clout of the internet. Cause if they're genuine, why record it for the world to see? Just shave your own head in private and surprise them in private, and if people notice in public, great. But why bother posting it on the internet? All for clout in my opinion. 
Another thing, even more controversial claim to support my statement that they do it for clout, I find the whole healthy people shaving their head for cancer patients to be.... Really attention seeking. In the end, their hair will grow back and that's why they do it easily, since they have nothing to worry about. 
I mean, let's replace cancer patients with accident patients that lost one of their arm. I don't see anyone from their friends or family chopping their arm off to show support now do they? Yup, 100% for clout. In my opinion, just be there for the patient is enough. No need to do all these extra things and especially to put it up on the internet for clout. 
This is just my view, I know it's controversial. But, you're welcome to change my mind on how to view things differently.

60937,107902,"I want to talk about rating people. We all rate people we choose. We rate them in terms of wealth, personality (we can vibe and is a good person) and appearance. 
I had a friend who had a crush on handsome and smart guy. The problem was that my friend was not pretty. However, she had a good personality, good sense of humour and was a kind person (does volunteering on weekends). Now, when she told our friend group, she had an immense backlash and everyone criticised that she is nowhere close to his level. Our friend group started to give ratings and she was rated 5 while the guy was rated a 9. This was a pure rating on appearance alone. 
Her crush being popular cycled through a bunch of girls who were quite pretty, a minimum of 8 solely based on appearance. However, I heard that there were clashes with the girls and finally, he found the girl that he clicked well with who was rated 9 on appearance as well as a 8 on personality. We knew this girl.
Sorry, this isn't a story about my friend getting her crush. This is real life and not a k-drama.
Since my friend was only 5, most of the guys who accepted her were also around 4-6 in terms of appearance. She cycled through them until she married guy who was 6 in terms of appearance and a 7 in terms of personality. 
My other friend who was around a 7 in terms of appearance got a guy who was a 5 in terms of appearance but was a 8 in terms of wealth and a 6 in terms of personality.
As much as I want to deny the idea of rating people and attaching numbers to a person solely based on the mentioned aspects, the reality is grimmer than that. I am sure people are going to come out and say that personality is more important than looks or wealth or any extrinsic values. The truth cannot be further than that. 
Let me explain.
If you are a 8 in terms of appearance, you will have a lot of guys showing interest in you. You probably will pick the best and you might not lower your standard so you probably pick a minimum of maybe 6 in terms of appearance and maybe makes up for it in terms of personality or wealth. You probably won't bother with anyone below that because you have enough options. You will cycle through your options until you maximise a high combined number for appearance, wealth and personality.
If you are a girl with an appearance of say 5. You will not get much options and similarly, you will cycle through your options to maximise your chances.
The irony is that the girl who an appearance rating of 8 but personality score of 6 might get a guy who has an appearance rating of 8 and personality rating of 8. However, the girl with an appearance rating of 5 and personality rating of 9 will never get a chance at the same guy. 
The only exception to this is if the guy interacts with the girl LONG ENOUGH and sees beyond the physical aspect. Most of whatever I said so far mainly ties with basic interactions (like meeting at an event) or dating apps where you might not know much about the person but you have to decide whether to pursue them or not. 
Basically, I am saying that the first filter is appearance/wealth and if you don't meet that rating for the guy or girl you like, you won't even be in their option list. Personality comes as an afterthought and ironically, takes more time for the person to appreciate. As mentioned, unless the person spends enough time with you to appreciate your personality, you will never be in their option list if you are poor (as a guy) or are ugly (both genders). In essence, pretty girls land with rich or/and handsome guys and vice-versa. 
Am I wrong? I am basing this from what I see happening around me. I wish I was wrong.

60946,107883,"Recently, I realised my manager likes to get others to buy lunch and pay for her first but never ever takes the initiative to return the money for her own meal. To be honest, it really seems like she deliberately does not want to return the money and not because it slipped her mind. Once, someone on the table initiated and asked the person who paid for her meal first how much she owed her and immediately did the transfer. She was just seated next to this person and looking at her as she asked that so there was no way she missed the conversation. Yet, she did not take the initiative to ask how much she owed for her meal. It’s honestly quite hilarious how she’s trying to get free meals out of colleagues who are earning way lesser than her (as we are all mostly fresh graduates). Even if she genuinely could not afford the meal for some reason, it doesn’t make it right for her to take advantage of others. I paid for her meal maybe twice and both times she did not pay me back. I learnt my lesson the hard way and have avoided including her in my lunch plans from then on. However, she is still my manager so working with her is inevitable. Is it bad if I can’t see her in the same light ever again? It’s like I truly lost my respect for her even as a leader in my job.

60995,107988,"What are your views on who ""should"" pay on the first date? This seems to be a hot topic and also a topic touched on in NUSWhispers numerous times before. Tldr; My view is that each person should pay for their OWN share, and neither party is responsible/obligated to pay for the other person's meal.
1. ""The guy should pay because he is a man"" - We live in a modern society where girls can earn just as much as guys, no longer in the 18th or 19th century, so why should a guy pay for the lady, who is able to earn just as much or even more than the guy can? Are girls to be treated as equals? Or an inferior gender such that they can't afford their own meal?
2. ""Whoever invites the other person should pay"" - I notice that many girls support this view, but yet we all know that guys usually ask the girl out first, and girls usually expect and hope for the guy to make the first move to ask the girl out first. And even when the girl likes the guy, girls would rather ""make it very obvious that they're interested so that the guy will take the hint and ask her out"", instead of asking the guy out themselves. If that's the case, this is as good as saying ""the guy should pay"".
I have another perspective to share with regards to this view. I think whoever invites the other person out for a first date is giving an invitation for both people to MUTUALLY agree that they would like to have a first meetup/date to get to know each other better, and NOT that the person who invites is going to treat a meal or anything. Think about it this way, when you tell your friends ""do you want to eat chicken rice together later?"", we instinctively know it is an invitation for both you and your friend to spend quality time together, and instinctively know that each of you are paying for your own share. This is how it should be when you invite someone out for a first date for both of you to mutually get to know each other.
3. ""I put on makeup for the date, and makeup is expensive, so if I dress up, of course he should pay for the meal"" - Does that mean that if I as the guy, buy a very expensive nice-looking outfit and wear it to the first date, you are obligated to treat me to a very expensive meal since I wore such an exquisite outfit for you to see? Your decision to put on makeup or dress up nicely or not is entirely your call and dependent on how you wish to present yourself, no guy is obligated/responsible to pay (indirectly by paying for your meal) for your fashion/makeup choices.
4. ""Guys don't have to pay, but if he pays it's bonus points"" - What some girls actually mean when you expand on this is, ""if he pays for my meal, yes it is bonus points for him, but if he doesn't, I would get turned off and deduct points and not meet again"". If you get turned off if a guy does not pay, it means your view is not for both to fairly pay their share, but for the guy to pay for your meal.
5. ""I'm a traditional woman and so I expect the man to pay just like old times"" - If you put these kind of old traditional expectations on a man, then does that mean that in return, you would hold yourself to traditional standards and expectations of a woman as well? Things such as having to obey and serve your husband/boyfriend/date, to cook and clean, to focus on taking care of kids, and not to be going out to work? Because if you expect a man to be traditional and ""provide"", then you should be giving what you wish to get as well. Realistically, which woman today actually act the ""traditional woman"" part despite calling themselves traditional? They just expect that from guys but yet don't hold themselves to the same ""traditional"" standards.
Why I think we should (man or woman) pay for our own share on a first date: It is SIMPLY fair, and it comes from a perspective where we both are equal individuals and view each other as such. The man or woman does not need to pay (for the other person's meal) in order to have an opportunity to get to know the other person, it is simply based upon mutual respect for each other that both are mutually agreeing to meet and explore where things goes romantically. Whether or not anyone (men or woman) treats the other person to a meal or drink, is not a ""SHOULD"", but a ""WANT"", if it happens.
Also, a first date is for both people to see if there is a connection, meaning a second date is still up for consideration and not confirmed for both people. Girls know this and yet if they still expect the guy to pay for their meal, it just reflects upon how all they're thinking is about themselves, and not being considerate for the guy and his money, definitely selfish, and a red flag. Some girls also just use guys as a ""free meal ticket"".
I hold myself to the same standards that I listed out above. Meaning, I DO NOT expect any woman to pay for my meals even if they ask me out. I do not expect girls to pay for me if I happen to wear an expensive outfit (this goes without saying but yeah). I respect the girl's time and do not feel entitled to her money.
I think that expecting the other person to pay for your meal (whether you're a man or woman), is an entitled attitude, and a red flag that people should avoid when finding a partner. As a guy, it seems like girls who have bad upbringing and bad peer influence are more likely to have this entitled attitude. The ""yes queen, you deserve better, you deserve more"" kind of messages that girls give each other, seem to feed into this whole delusional and entitled mentality that some girls have.
What are your views on this?

Ignoring the law aspect on this : If I dress up as a McDonald's worker and go to McDonald, customers there may assume I'm a worker and asked for help, or workers there may assume I'm new there, but I'll just tell them ""Oh I don't work here. Just dress up like one"".
So same goes for if you dress up like a wh*re, then people will look at you and probably treat you like a wh*re , regardless if you're actually a wh*re or not. 
My point is, people actually do judge the book by its cover. People will automatically look at you a certain way, and treat you a certain way, if you dress a certain way. 
So stop with the whole ""Just because dress/look like X doesn't mean I am Y"" kind of argument. Just accept the reality of life. 
The faster you learn and accept this, the better your life is. There's nothing you can do. Just accept it. It'll save your life.

60933,107842,"Please, I really need help. I was born with a disease which can only be treated with surgery. My boss is going to terminate me because I am unable to do ridiculous things like working extremely overtime, as it takes a toll on my already sick body. However, my work quality is not compromised and surpasses most who work overtime. Many other colleagues and supervisors are witnesses to this. In my boss's eyes, working overtime is the quality of a good employee. He has found more foreign employees to take over my role already. I interviewed with another company, whose boss knows my current boss. Unfortunately, they talked, and this boss has also rejected me, citing my health reasons. In my current company, most of my colleagues expressed concern and understanding of my condition, with the exception of two, who bully me due to my health issues. They spread malicious remarks and mockery about my health condition, and even intentionally sabotage me at work to make me look bad. There are evidences to back these up from my other colleagues. These two are those who also think that working overtime is essential, although my work and schedule does not affect their work and schedule at all. I have raised this to my boss, which was also supported by my other colleagues who witnessed the bullying. Unfortunately, since my boss is prepared to terminate me, he dismissed me despite adequate evidence of wrongdoings. The surgery required for my condition is a major one with high risks, hence I am hesitant and putting much consideration into it. I feel very helpless that despite being a good worker and my condition not affecting my work significantly, I am being bullied and replaced in the workforce. I do not know what to do and I really need advice please, thank you.

60949,107889,"Hi, I am in a weird situation. I like helping people and do a lot of volunteering work on the side. I don't like to hurt people.
However, I like girls who are not so nice. Ok, I dont refer to girls who are abusing or throwing plates at people. These are girls are not evil but at the same time, they arent angels either. They are usually selfish and they dress like they going to party after class everyday. They dont actually care about other people but they dont go out of their way to hurt them either.
On the other hand, I dont actually feel attracted to girls who are caring, you know the ones that do volunteering or stay back to help other people after class. 
Of course, being the kind guy I am, the badass girls dont actually find me attractive. I am a kind, emphathetic and caring person which they dont find attractive (I know I repeated the sentence). They seem to go for the badass versions, like the guy versions of themselves, you know the selfish and sometimes even toxic kind.
The kind and caring girls are a 50 50. Some of them go for the kind guys whereas some go for the badass guys. 
None of these makes any sense to me. 
Also, can I do something to be more attractive to badass girls without losing my caring qualities?
PS: I am gyming regularly, have a hobby of painting and my grades are above average. I have small grp of friends but they are mostly similar kind of volunteery people. (Most of them get caring type gfs so I am the weirdo).

60954,107899,"When is it a boundary and when is it controlling (behaviour)? I can't figure it out. I find it very hard not to have any expectation of your partner in the relationship. I always thought open communication about your expectations was the key but apparently, it is not (look at the end).
When you go into a relationship, you do expect some things from your partner (either explicitly and in most cases, implicitly). You expect your partner to support you, be there for you, pamper you, put in effort for you, go on dates with you, etc. If you have no expectations from your partner, then you will never be unhappy right? If your date cancels on you last minute, you won't be unhappy because you don't expect your date to show up. If your partner forgets your birthday, then you won't be unhappy because you don't have expectations on your partner to celebrate it with you. 
Someone asked me if I would let my gf go clubbing with her friends (let's assume there are guys).  I feel like this is a landmine question.
I have had friends who cheated on their bfs/gfs (yes both ways) when they go clubbing. Yes, their partner put full trust in them and they took advantage of it. Not everyone is the same but it is very hard. Again, there are those that cheat at work or other places as well so no gurantee. 
So honestly, I don't feel comfortable if my gf went clubbing with her friends but if I start restricting her, then she would feel that I don't trust her. While drinking, you are not at your 100% and you might just screw it up (cheat accidentally). If that happens, then bye bye relationship. If I start restricting her, she will feel suffocated and that I am controlling her. If I let her go into risky situations, then the relationship could potential get messed over a stupid thing. 
So if your bf asked if you are ok with him helping a female colleague, who is flirty, young and dresses sexily, after work hours, would you be ok? In my mind, my thoughts are genuine and I have no feelings for her. On the other hand, girls would say that this is so red flaggy and I want to seriously meet the girl who says she is fine with this hahaha.....
Apparently, boundaries are things that you place on yourself and are not expectations of another person. 
If my gf is posting sexy pics of herself on instagram and I am not comfortable with it, am I allowed to request her not to do it? Am I allowed to tell her that I am insecure about it and it would put my mind at ease if she didn't do it? If I said that if she stills want to continue posting such pics, then I don't want to be in this relationship, is that fine? The answer is no because I would taking away her freedom to express herself and I am controlling her. By threatening an exit from the relationship, I am basically manipulating her. A woman can wear what she want and I cannot place an expectation on her. It is not a boundary, it is an expectation and controlling behaviour. 
When you marry someone, you do expect the person to be loyal and not cheat which is a blatant expectation. One day your partner says they have a certain fetish or kink but you are not willing to do it for them. Is it ok if they seek satisfaction from an external party instead? Most normal couples would say no (except open relationships which we will put aside). Isn't this controlling? They do want to express their sexuality in a certain way. I know this is an extreme example. 
If you date someone, a gf expects her bf to buy things or spend on gifts on Valentine's day. If the bf doesn't do it, then the gf will be angry. Isn't this controlling in the sense you are expecting your partner to do something for you on Valentine, especially when all the prices are all jacked up?
I expect my gf not to cheat on me. If my gf cheats on me, I would leave the relationship. It is a blatant expectation right? Is this a controlling behaviour?
I like to chat with girls and dm into their socials. I just like chatting and that is all. It is fun and gives me a little validation. If my gf says I cannot do this, is this controlling or a boundary?
As a guy, I am married to a girl. After marrying, I realise that I like to wear female clothing. Say I wear sexy female clothing and post it on instagram to express myself. My wife asks me to take down my pics and instagram page and threatens to leave the relationship if I don't. IShe is feeling embarrassed about her husband and a lot of people are commenting. Is she controlling or setting a boundary? A man can wear what he wants right? or can he? 
My close friend who is a female gives me hugs and kisses to show her love. We don't have any weird feelings except for bro-sis feelings. My gf tells me that she is insecure and wants me to at least stop touching each other. Is she controlling or setting a boundary? 
Last example, I love drinking alcohol a lot. I drink with a lot of people and it does cost a lot of money. If my gf asks me to cut down and not waste too much money on alcohol, is it a boundary or controlling? She is afraid my health is at risk and too much money down the drain. Is this fair? But I love drinking, it is my way to connect and enjoy life. Controlling or not?
Initially, I thought that if I communicated my ""expectations"" (let's not say use the term ""boundaries"") like not posting sexy pics or clubbing till 4am in the morning with her friends, she is agreeable, then it is fine. If she doesn't agree, she is fine to find someone else who doesn't have such restrictions. I just don't want to worry over stupid things. The most important thing in my mind is that we don't force someone to do something they don't and if they don't agree with what you want/expect from a partner, they are fine to leave. However, it has come to my knowledge that even stating your ""expectations"" to someone is toxic and manipulative, like the Jonah Hill incident. Maybe he phrased it wrongly but basically, he just stated his ""expectations"" and if she felt suffocated, she could have just stated no to them and don't even get into a relationship with him. I do agree that was not a smart move to pick a girl that conflicted with his ""expectations"" in the first place but I don't think he needed to receive so much backlash. Obviously his ""expectations"" conflicted with her job so she could have just said no from the get go. Why make a hu ha about it?
If you realise your partner does not fit your expectation, you can find someone else. What if you are married and your partner doesn't fit your expectations? How would you reconcile then? No is perfect without insecurities. What is the right way to approach this?

2. Withdraw my CPF.
3. Short the Singapore stock market with the proceeds.
There is no future for me here. This is a country for those born with a golden (silver aint enough) spoon in their mouths.
Looking at our birth rates and unfavourable costs of raising children, we won't even have the young populace to support the tax burden of maintaining all our healthcare needs in the long run. Our shiny MRTs and other public amenities aren't cheap to maintain either.
There's plenty that needs changing before I can believe this is a country which looks out for the future of its younger adults as opposed to maintaining the net worth of the rent-seeking older ones.
This country behaves like there is a perpetual motion machine to prop all this up. I am not that optimistic.
