60651,107226,"My boyfriend suggested me to join him and his family on a 2d1n Batam trip to celebrate Mother's Day. I casually agreed cause i'm available and free on that day too.
Upon buying the ticket, I asked him if we can go for a 1h message. Which he deny as he say we can only do stuff the mum wants to do as this is a celebration for her. Thus we should not do our own things.
Then i proceed to ask if late at night, when everyone is asleep can we at least spend some couple time, which he also deny. Cause he say he don't want his family seeing or hearing us.
I kind of regret agreeing to go cause he say this trip should be a bonding trip with his family. So now im wondering who is his mother? Cause it sounds like my 2d1n gotta revolve around this 'queen' -.-""

Did you know that he asked me to go back to work in his company (yes I left my job to work for him and he didn't pay my salary for years)1 week after I got C-section with our youngest daughter 3 years ago? I hope you really have a long thought about wrecking a family. Please note we still do couple things. What makes you think he is faithful to you if he is cheating with his wife?
I have been enduring his infidelity for 10 years, can you handle that?

60652,107227,"Hi all,
I am writing this with extreme fear.
I am a Science graduate and I worked for an up and coming company in the cellular agricultural space. When I used to read the news about this company, I thought this was my chance to be involved in a field which can potentially disrupt how we consume food. So, i jumped on the opportunity and joined this company. This is the end of a good part of the story.
After I joined, I was really excited to work for this company. The first few weeks were like a breeze. I came to the office to learn about different aspects of this field, attend meetings, go for lunch in this ulu place with one hawker centre with colleagues and also observe people do work. When I got my opportunity to do hands-on work, I was ecstatic. After a few days, I started to get frustrated as I was not able to get any cool results , whereas others in the meeting were discussing how well their experiments worked. After a few months of frustration, I started to ask for help with my experiments and materials from my reporting officers and colleagues. They will give me some materials and when I redo the experiments and fail again. Then, I started asking some more detailed questions and I got the statement "" I don't have access to that information"". But in the meantime, some people in my group revealed that they just say whatever the boss wants.
That's when I started to talk to more people from other departments and realised that we don't have anything that has been claimed by the boss in the media. For example, our company revealed that they had successfully created a shrimp cell line (we didn't have any working cells), company mentioned that we had successfully reduced the cost of cultivated shrimp meat production. No one in the company knew how to achieve that. We inaugurated a production plant. After that, no one has used it for any purpose (A big expensive bioreactor, except for photoshoots). With all these falsehoods, I dawned on me, i had joined a company that looked more like one of those companies in the US (ther-o-anus) where everything is mired in secrecy but in reality they didn't have anything.
To add to my research frustration, our boss used to hold a company-wide meeting to publicly shame departments who didn't have much progress. And will tell us to give 200%, make yourself useful to the company and all those Bullshit. Then she will be vacationing in some exotic location. We had an inside joke. She was always on vacation, but stated that she was at work. yeah right, 2 months vacation for work and post 2 meeting pictures. Come-on, lah, you think we all don't know what it means.
Our boss runs the company like a friend and family business. At one time, her husband, her sister-in-law, her previous lab mates, previous room mates, her previous institute mates, all mates were in the company. After so much complaining about the uselessness of these people, the company fired a few of them.
In the beginning, i mentioned that I was scared to write this. It is mainly because our boss, like all other dubious companies, goes after people with legal sticks using company money. So, i am writing here.
Hope this post encourages people who are working in this company and previous employees to come forward to expose this scam of a company.

But from telling her stories about my life or discussing events, I realized she has little empathy which confuses me. Like she doesn’t really understand what other people might feel and takes very little interest. She also has a tendency to treat even romantic or social interactions as very clinical and methodological which throws me off. Even her hobbies or to do things are all from a Google list of what’s popular. It is not possible to talk to her about this because she is super sensitive to the mention of anything mental related.

Ever since my mom got addicted to TikTok she stopped doing normal daily tasks like turning on the light at night. When I come home from work around 7+pm she will be sitting on the sofa in the dark watching TikTok. She doesn't want to cook even though she's the most free, because she needs to keep up with TikTok. Sometimes she even skips meals because she can't be bothered to find food.
Even during dinners she watches TikTok. My dad once told her off because dinner times are usually our only bonding time because we work in the day.
Not only that, why do people who watch TikTok have to blast it at max volume and replay the same video over and over and over again? I can hear it from across the house and it gets so annoying.
Put down the phone and communicate with the family. TikTok is like some drug and I hate it.

Due to poor management, our turnover rate have been very high, with an average of 6 people resigning per year. Because of this, my workload had increased significantly compared to when i first joined, on top of taking a bit of side projects. Therefore, I'm thinking of requesting for a promotion.
However, here come the problem, I also have a couple of hard-core colleagues who not only took on high workload, but is willing to take on more side projects by staying back late almost everyday even without OT pay or bringing work home sometimes. I only stayed back late once in a blue moon to complete really urgent stuff as I believe in work-life balance.
Now my question is, generally for promotion, is it dependent solely on my contribution over the years or does promotion works like a bell curve, which is relative to how I compare against my colleagues? If it's the latter, does this mean I have no right to bring up promotion?

About half a year ago, she decided to get a rabbit on impulse. I was surprised as she never really showed a great deal of interest in animals, but then again she is fickle and prone to having such ""phases"". It was the cutest little thing ever, all fluff and giant ears with a little waggling bobtail. I played with it only a couple times when I visited, but I loved the little bunny to bits.
Last week, I met her for coffee and I asked her how her rabbit was doing. She casually mentioned that it had died some time ago without even batting an eyelid. Mortified, I asked what had happened and she said that she had been leaving the bunny out on her bare concrete balcony most days as she didn't like having fur all over the house, and one evening she came home and it was ""just laying there dead"". The poor wretched thing had literally been baked to death in the scorching 35 degree heat!
As distressing as the news was, what I found the most disturbing was her complete lack of guilt -or any kind of emotion at all- that she had basically murdered a helpless living thing out of willful negligence. She brushed right over the subject like it was just some idle gossip, leaving me utterly speechless.
I feel like I can no longer associate myself with someone with such sociopathic tendencies and I have been avoiding her since that day. I also can't help but think of how much the rabbit must have suffered before it died. I even considered reporting her anonymously to the SPCA for animal cruelty, but it's too late for that. RIP little sweet angel.. I hope you're in bunny heaven now, wherever that may be.

60657,107245,"Does anyone else feel that the term ""mommy's boy"" is being overly used as a cover for toxic feminism?
I don't deny that there are really some guys that are overly focused on their parents, and I'm not referring to them. However, lately, it seems that any time a guy has any sort of consideration for their mother at all, it gets called out for being a mommy's boy, and it's a ""red flag"" worthy of being dumped right away.
It's funny how it is totally fine for women to want, and even have expectations to their partners, to be filial to their own parents. Everything men do must take her parents into consideration, at times even having to provide for them, yet having any consideration for the mens' parents at all seem to make him the worst person in the universe.
It seems to point more towards a certain amount of self-centredness where women must be the the centre of the universe in a relationship and everything should revolve around their whims and fancy, whereas the man purely exists to serve her and must drop all his other familial responsibilities while upholding hers.

However, he was met with some setbacks, extended his studies. Few years down the road, a female friend of W (let's call her MO) who was cheated on by her then bf, began putting thoughts into W's head that guys studying overseas always cheat on their girlfriends in Sg blah blah blah, and why should W waste time on my poor friend when there are so many other guys in Sg with money and career etc that can satisfy her needs. In the end, W cheated on him by going on Tinder, meeting guys on the pretext that she is looking for friends but actually, options. In the end she settled for one engineering guy, very shortly after BTOed and recently got married, posting everything on social media, while my poor friend in Australia was left heartbroken on his own during COVID lockdown period back then away from everything, helpless. Just because of such toxicity, one poor chap had his relationship ended while he is working towards his dream.
I am going on an exchange soon, and I'm really worried, what if someone toxic and blonde like MO, decides to plant thoughts into my girlfriend, and I experience the same outcome. What should I do? I have a good and healthy relationship with my gf, just like my friend and W back then, but things well down south really quickly for them.

60654,107238,"Hi Prof Ben, I am interested in pursuing a career in the field of robotics R&D, but I have some reservations regarding its current state of hype.
1) Undoubtedly, the adoption of robotics is inevitable as the economic feasibility and alignment of the technology are well-established. Nevertheless, my reservations center around the pursuit of deep tech R&D in Singapore, particularly in robotics. The existence of numerous R&D positions in MNCs seems somewhat contrived, as they would not exist without government funding. Furthermore, many R&D corporate labs are conducting research on topics that are not closely aligned with their core business, which raises concerns about the artificiality of the situation.
2) Given Singapore's tendency to prioritize proven technologies rather than being an early adopter of cutting-edge advancements, I am hesitant to fully invest myself in deep tech. The fear of a sudden cessation of funding for robotics R&D, akin to what occurred in the autonomous driving industry in 2017 or the pharmaceuticals R&D industry a few years prior, makes me hesitant about going on the path of deep tech
Joining deep tech requires significant investment to excel in this field, such as spending years and large sums of money obtaining a postgraduate degree, and committing non-transferable specialized skills to this niche which might make pivoting to other fields hard.
I like robotics, but I'm hesitant to enter a potentially artificially inflated industry that may lose government funding and support if outcomes and results fail to meet expectations.
I'm genuinely curious to see what is your opinion on this, or if I'm overthinking

60655,107240,"Differences in political views and understanding makes it impossible for a relationship? I have been texting a guy from China (we got know each other by chance; we would see each other around but never talked and recently he talked to me and asked to hang out sometimes as he doesn't know many people). Due to cultural differences and also my poor command of chinese, just asking the folks here, was he asking me out?
Recently we kind of touched on the subject of certain areas in China and there was a clash in opinions (mainly because of the different media that we are exposed to; he only accesses chinese media while I only access western-centred media). I think he was kind of unhappy and we kind of stopped texting. I am also not sure if he is interested in me or just trying to make friends. If he is interested in being more than friends, would this ever work out? I think language barriers, cultural differences can be worked through, but what about political differences? In this case where one party has and will only consider one media outlet as a source of information. Should I just give up? Students from China, or anyone who has dated someone from China, please weigh in! One thing to note is that he is about (30+ 40) and not good in English. Thanks!

pelting the ground and striking claps of thunder. Suddenly I'm in the jungle, boots on muddied grass. The whistling of bullet noises all round me. I realise I'm out of position. I'm riding the MRT back home.
During meals, I begin by eating as fast as I can, dreading the shell-scrape I have to dig later. There's no objective to meet, to rush to wait and there's a perfectly good toilet in the cafeteria I'm at.
When I'm called upon to answer, ingrained man-mode kicks in. I'm on the courtyard where the safe answer is the best answer or it's hands and feet on the ground where the gruelling cycle of physical discomfort begins. I'm in tutorial on campus.
It's been almost a year out of out of the jungle but for some reason, a part of me remains there.

60644,107196,"This is my confession.
I matriculated into nus half a decade ago and was fortunate to be in a chill course that did not take up many school days.
So, I decided to take up internships during my first year, during before summer break started. Year 2, I decided to stop so that I can try other types of internships,but was rejected form the one I wanted, hence I decided to only take up an internship during break cause bo-pian. Doing so, I had alot of free time left and was quite bored. I then decided to sneak into other faculties lectures to fill up the time. After a month of doing so, I realised that what I wanted to do was entirely different from the course I was studying.
Now, I work at wall-street and the hours are absolutely dreadful, 7am in the office and ends at12 midnight on a lucky day,, 1+ to 2am on a normal day. No such thing as holidays, weekends. Sometimes I even dream that I'm at work, working then waking up to go to work.
Now I lament, and am starting to regret the previous decision leading to my change in course direction and should have stuck to my original course. What is the point of money if my life is having my ass stuck to this damn chair staring at 5-6 screens all day.

I have stopped in person lectures/tutorials for 2 years now and have focused solely on doing my internships and mugging like a dog at home, managed to maintain a 4.0 gpa. Now I realise idh have friends in school and only have hi-bye workmates. I've realised that I might have made a mistake and intend to course correct. I'm okay with my coworkers and have heard that I would most likely get a position in the company should I choose to apply for it but I'm unable to discern if this is sweet-talk or not to milk more unpaid labour. Question is, do I ditch the internship that I'm in right now completely to attend class?
