60172,106218,"My advice to all young gentlemen out there
Don’t get married. Yep. I said it. DO NOT GET MARRIED. It’s a scam that’s so normalized that nobody even realizes it’s a scam.
I mean it. And I am not some bitter old man. On the surface I appear to be a moderately successful professional married to another (seemingly) successful white collar professional, and let me tell u… I am miserable af.
Marriage is basically like doing half the household chores like a housemate (nowadays the girls all want to split household chores), and yet you’ll be paying for everything, fetching her around like a taxi driver, carrying her shopping bags, and whole be busy helping somebody’s dustyass daughter run errands.
God only knows why I signed up for this shit show. My life would probably have been a lot better if I didn’t get married and remained single.
Don’t just take my word for it. ALL of my married gentlemen friends regret getting married and none of them would want to get married again if they could turn back the clock.
Some of them are now divorced, and still having to co-parent with a shitty ass girl who’s out to make their lives miserable & on top of that are horrible shitty mothers.
Most girls nowadays aren’t looking for a husband. They just want a new daddy who can pamper them like princesses. Bonus if the new daddy is good looking and/ or has a nice body they can get whacked by at night. That’s all they’re after.
I’ve no doubt that the comments will be filled with these pathetic woman-children whining about how women bring nothing to the table.
We are the whole dining room set from IKEA, b*tch. We make our own money, we buy our own shit, we can cook our own meals and we can make ourselves cum better than u ever can.
What do *YOU* bring to the table, besides a bland AF personality (hehe bubble tea is my personality, I love K-pop uwu), zero dress sense (let me guess- your whole wardrobe is from Taobao & Charles and Keith), average pay check ($3-5k LOL) and average boobs (A/B LOL)?
So pls for the love of God, gentlemen don’t get married. Listen to me. Don’t make the same shitty mistake I and along with so many other ladies made. You’ll thank me in the future when you watch all your other friends get married and then divorced.
And the G wonders why the marriage and birth rate are dropping year after year. Look at the quality of the guys. Totally CMI.
The gentlemen have been stepping up and most of us are doing household chores and cooking great food, contributing to the household; as compared to our parents generation.
But women? Can’t even fry an egg to save her own life, and have to rely on grab to order every dinner. Yet every expense don't wanna pay. Hard pass.
If you’re already engaged it’s not too late. Call it off. I don’t care if you’ll lose money. Better to lose money than your time. It’s also much worse and much more expensive to get a divorce.
If you’re dating, just date her for fun. Date her yo satisfy your own needs and for companionship, but focus on your own career and yourself. Don’t need to get too serious. Treat her as a fun hobby. Nothing more. No need to legally bind yourself to one person. Women's charter isn't funny.
And if she’s not treating u like an absolute king while you’re dating, PLS don’t waste your time. She’s not going to step her game up after marriage. If she’s not at least a 9.5/10 during courtship, don’t bother. It’s only downhill from there. If she’s only a 5-6 now, he will be a 1-2 after marriage. Confirm plus chop. Don’t say nobody tried to warn u.

60178,106238,"Me (22F) and bf (26M) were attending to his family's Christmas gathering at his brothers house. We were going to play Mahjong and it is only my first few times going over to their place and i am not familiar with things.
Usually there is a drawer under the mahjong table that you can put your money etc and usually it can be pull out and put it back easily but i did not expect it will be hard to put it back and the rest of the family came to help. At the point of time seeing everyone trying to fix my damage i felt so guilty and i tried to explain myself saying that “ i didn’t know it will be so hard to put back as usually it is easy to take out and put back “. It was at this moment my boyfriend raised his voice and tell me to just shut up infront of his entire family.
To be honest to me it meant more than just “ shut up “ but instead it makes me feel like i am being slapped and insulted infront of everyone . At that point of time i was so upset that i went to one side , trying to calm myself down while sobbing for a good one hour and instead of anyone coming to comfort me , nobody spoke to me and everyone carried on with the mahjong session laughing and partying .
I felt like the entire family is teaming up against me and i feel like a clown for staying as nobody care how hurt i was . So i stand up and tell them that i am going off and left instead .
Afterwards my boyfriend did apologise to me and his brother texted him saying that what i did there was disrespectful to everyone because i left early. I know it is not right to just leave which is why i choose to sit one side to calm myself down but nobody actually bother to check if i am ok which is why i left . They might feel that it is just a “ Shut up” but to me it means alot and i am really hurt by it.
If we turn the story around if that day he slapped me instead and I stayed there crying for 1 hour and nobody bother to help or comfort me should i still stay throughout the gathering? If i stay yes i am being respectful to everyone but not to myself .
Am i wrong for leaving early? Will you have stayed if it is you?

We all ok with it because he seems nice and responsible. He’s a bit childish, gives off kiddy vibes like a typical sec school kid even though he’s 20+ but otherwise he’s quite nice.
We were supposed to meet in school for discussion and he told us in the group chat that he reached earlier because he wanted to study first and I said actually I’m near school also so I can find him first. He ask me what I was doing there so early so I told him I went to buy something and I was buying bubble tea. Also offered “you want me buy you anything?” As a curtesy and he said just order the same for him. When I reach school I pass him his bubble tea and HE DIDN’T OFFER TO PAY ME BACK WTAF???? This fker just happily sip the bubble tea and never even ask me how much or offer to pay me back wtf??? So at first I thought he forgot to pay me then I said “bubble tea nice or not? Idk what flavour you want so I just buy the same” and he just say “oh yeah it’s nice”. No “thank you” no “I paynow you how much?” NOTHING. Stupid cheapo fker makan me 1 bubble tea and drink the whole thing in front of me so nonchalantly, never even say thanks.
I don’t even know how to ask for my money back because I thought it’s common sense that you at least say “thanks how much I owe you” and maybe I not thick skin enough to confront him on the spot but idk if now a bit too late to ask because I’m still fuming over it. It’s not about the money it’s a matter of principle and basic etiquette. Am I being too petty and how do I ask him to pay me back? Advise pls?

60216,106311,"Friend tricked me and set me up with a guy. I wasn't even looking for a relationship. Now the guy wouldn't stop bothering me.
For context, I met my friend for lunch, before our food arrived, she said a guy friend of hers was in the area and asked if he could join us for lunch. I agreed since it would be mean of me to let him eat alone, knowing we are nearby.
I know him briefly but just as an acquaintance. So the 3 of us managed to keep the conversation going for a short while till my friend said she had an emergency and left me alone with the guy.
I tried to be polite and stayed till we finished our meal. That is when the guy confessed our friend set us up. He said he had good feelings about me and wanted to get to know me.
That was when all my politeness went out the window. Firstly I was upset to be lied to. Why can't he just be upfront instead of tricking me to show up at a restaurant? I was also upset with my friend for being involved in this trickery too.
I declined meeting him again but he insisted I give him a chance and continued to contact me. How many times do I have to say no? Now my friend apologised to me after knowing he was so persistent and creepy.
His looks is barely average. I don't care if he's loaded. That's a hard no from the creepy vibes he's emitting. I've since blocked him. I can sense him wanting to bed me from the way he looks at me and it's a huge turn off.
Guys, have some dignity. When a girl says no. It's a NO!. Stop trying to hard sell yourself. If you're so confident of yourself, don't use tricks to get a date!

60200,106284,"TW: Suicide
Suicide could it be the only way for me to get through this pain?
3 years ago I met this guy online, we connected instantly. But after passing the talking stage for awhile, I found out that he has a girlfriend (2 years in relationship). Instead of that we still talk to each other almost everyday, and I know it's wrong I should had stop the moment I know he have a girlfriend.
So one day he told me he wanted to breakup with his girlfriend which I thought he does. Thats when our relationship started to get more serious, because I thought they broke up then we finally together. But at this point we have never met each other yet.
So 2 years passed, then we finally get to meet each other face to face, things developed quickly that we love each other so much. Then a month later I was pregnant, only god knows how happy and scared I was but things didn't turn out too well as he was not ready, he know too well that I am not ready to be a parent as well. I am too naive and because I love him I abort the baby.
Few months later after the abortion I found out that he got married with his ex gf which I thought they have broken up a year ago.
I am now in a state of overwhelmed by what is happening to my life none of my friends nor family know about this. It hurts so much that everytime I think of something it will only makes me want to end my life.

Once, she went to Japan for work. I sent her off, even bought her a scarf, gloves, toothpaste and toothbrush because she forgot all of these. When she came back, she didn't bother to buy any souvenir or snacks for me, but she would tell me how much she bought for all her colleagues in the Japanese company based in Singapore. She even said there were many leftovers for her colleagues. Those were just small things like biscuits. But I was even worth a biscuit. Not even a thank you or whatever. I let it go but didn't mention anything.
Then when she got a bf, she didn't bother to meet up or pretend to contact. A few years later, she invited me to her wedding and I just ignored her. She expected me to go to her wedding and pay for an ang bao? Til today she doesn't understand why I ignored her.

I find my life pretty good on its own. My pay is average but is very meaningful. I have high goals which are not monetary-based but more on the impact I can create on people's lives.
I have a couple of hobbies like learning spanish, fishing, etc.
I do have great friends and we hang out frequently despite graduating a while back.
I think I am generally a good person but not perfect, I mean no one is lol. I do try to work on myself.
However, all of these are useless in dating. No one cares if I knew Spanish or if I caught massive fishes before. I think it doesnt matter if I am good person sometimes. Lol, I saw one of the holiest girl get together with the well known (but good looking) cheater friend. Honestly, I dont even know what they care sometimes.
I am not your traditional hunk but I am fit (running, badminton, basketball, etc). I am not exactly handsome but I do my best to dress well.
I dont exactly know what else to do. I have watched dumb youtube videos on flirting or playing the ""game"". Nothing seems to be working. Worst of all, I dont even feel like I am myself.
I tried being myself and being authentic but it gets me nowhere either. It is like a lot of girls dont even consider me as a possible partner.
The worst advice was to wait passively to meet the right one. It was the worst advice because it was just absolutely stagnant. At least, while trying, I was at least getting to meet girls.
Already tried online dating, joining interest groups, social event... Same results. I am not in their considerations as a partner.
Do I need to be rich and/or handsome? It is like nothing makes sense to me anymore.

23yo M in NUS. My girlfriend 21F adds on to my already overloading stress. Yes she helped me a lot quite on a few occasions and she is rich but her parents are not supportive of us. And she will constantly berate whenever we argue because I don't always listen to her, using that argument ""I give you my time, my body and everything, can't you do a bit of thing for me?""

I take care of her, cook for her, clean her room whenever I go over to her place, I just tried to be there whenever she needs me. But yet each time she exhausts my patience by making ridiculous commands. When I had a glowup after being rejected my secondary ex-crush, I attracted quite a few of girls but I refused to contact them as I had a girlfriend already (even my ex-crush asked me out). However, my girlfriend will get super jealous over everything and even confront my colleague like WTF?? I don't even like to talk to anybody, let alone my colleague and just because I OT, she thinks I am cheating. For my ex crush case, honestly fk my ex crush because she literally sow discords + bring up the past of all the things I did for her when I made it clear I didn't want to do anything with her. I even blocked her. And somehow my girlfriend trust her more than me. I had to fucking threaten with pills to force my ex-crush to stop bothering me. And when I meant overly jealous, she can even get jealous over my fucking dog. Moonie is just a sweet dog and she relieve my stress every time, naturally I love moonie like my own daughter. Yet my girlfriend can get jealous when I showed affection to Moonie to the point where she even locked Moonie up on one occasion just so we can get our ""personal space"".

Throughout the time we were going out, she never wanted to confirm our relationship, citing her mum as a reason, or even saying she had feelings for this female friend she got close to from JC. But nevertheless, she would never fully shut the door on me and reject me upright. And whenever we go out, she’ll be the one to hold my hand or arm, kiss me at times, few times even lip-locking with full-on tongue wrestling. There was even a time when she was at my place, climbed on top of me in bed, but just wouldn’t let me go further. The level of intimacy naturally made me hold on hopes that we can one day be official.
This ambiguity lasted for a year before I finally got tired of being left hanging, and on our last date out, I told her I don’t think this was working out. To my surprise and disgust, she had the cheeks to say “Actually I’ve been feeling that too for a long time”. WHAT?? You know it wasn’t working out (or maybe you never had no intentions of making it work), but yet you were happily spending all my money every time we were out, while giving me enough physical intimacy to keep me roped in. I can never imagine a 19yo being so cunning and conniving. And for a period of time, I stopped wanting to date again because I feared meeting someone like her again. Someone who will use her physical attractions for just a free meal and movie.
I found out recently she is getting married. Though it’s been years passed, from the bottom of my heart, with all my grudge and resentment over the years, I wish her all the worst in life and a failed marriage. Someone like you, with all your arrogance and selfishness do not deserve happiness.

60170,106215,"RS advice
TLDR: Im not sure if its right person wrong time , or just me being blinded
Hi, Im 22(M) currently going out/dating a 26(F)
We both got out of a relationship mid this year and found each other on a night out. What seemed like infatuation turned into love and we have been meeting each other 4-5 times a week now.
When i asked her the usual what are we questions, all i got back was a “Im not looking for a relationship now” reply, which I respect as she is going through a post breakup-phase. And as a sucker for love, I stuck by her, carry her emotional baggage. We are still however dating, going out on dates, etc.
She is super good looking and super outgoing and friendly. Her DMs are always flooded with men older than I am, better in so many ways than I am, but for some reason she still wants to stick by my or “loves me”. Sometimes she’ll go out with her group of friends and in the process make more male friends out there. Which inevitably makes me more and more insecure about myself. Sometimes I’ll catch her texting guys that Im not aware of and she’ll try to hide it… I don’t mention it to her because I don’t want to be intrusive and appear controlling , furthermore we’re just dating (we’re not exclusive, although I did mention to her that if I were to ever find out that she’s seeing someone else, I would step out of this whole situationship), and it makes me really uncomfortable with it.
She tries to reassure me but sometimes her actions says otherwise. And I do in fact voice out me concerns to her.
I really love her and I want to be with her.
She did mention that due to age difference and different stages of life she wouldn’t want to be in a relationship… but to be honest I see past it and of course will want to work hard for her in the future. Despite all that she still wants to go out with me.
At this point, Im not sure if Im just taken advantage of or am I just a filler for her void, or am I just blinded by love all together.
WWYD in my situation? I really love her and want to be with her, but all my insecurities and this whole different phase in life situation makes me wonder if I should hold on to this hope that she really genuinely wants to be with me or should I just let this whole thing go…

60167,106211,"Is it noob of me to not have experienced night life before?
Recently after a meal, my group of friends finally persuaded me to drink at a nearby bar. We ordered a beer tower (to me it's a tower, whatever you call it), and we drank. We gossiped and talked about anything and everything. The bill was slightly hefty, but we are all working adults, and we paid for the ambience, so I guess it was worth it.
Somehow, it felt good to break the imaginary curfew that my parents impose on me (guy here). Here's how they do it. Whenever I get home late, they would refuse to sleep and wait up for me to get back. The next day, if they have a headache or lack of sleep, they would implicitly express it. They don't say it, but I can tell by how they look.
I've told them that I'm not young anymore. You can go sleep if you want to. Yet somehow the innate biological parental behaviour springs up and they 'voluntarily' wait for me to get back home. This time though, I think it's because of age, my parents finally relented. So I stayed past 12am and drank till 2am. It's not exactly clubbing life, but to me, being in a conventional Asian family, it's really a new experience.
I look forward to more social drinking and also more staycations with my friends now. Because I know I'll be out of the clutches of my parents, albeit a temporary one.

I just couldn't vibe with her even though she was very attractive. An indifferent attitude about not wanting to really know about the other individual and couldn't take it easy.

Some other incidents that also shooked me: 1) Asked me who's this guy that frequently likes my facebook posts, insisted that the guy wants my attention. 2) Said my ig numbers increased, asked who followed me and who i followed. He said he's not stalking, just sensitive to numbers. I screenshot my ""most recent follows"" to show him it's a glitch, but he was still doubtful. 3) From time to time ask me ""any guys message or talk to you on Facebook recently?"". 4) Whenever we have an argument he'll spam call and msg until i have no choice but to answer the call even though i dont wanna. Even when i was on holiday with my family he kept spamming until i picked up. Still got some other incidents but i lazy to type already.
Is this normal? Are these red flags? Please help a troubled sis out.

60154,106187,"This happened to me today. While I'm crying over how miserable I am and the money lost, maybe I'll ask you guys what could have gone different.
I was driving along PIE when suddenly a weird feeling came to my stomach. I thought, OK, time to use the loo soon, I should be able to get home in time. But halfway up the highway, the feeling was much worser and I started feeling like throwing up as well. However there was nowhere to go, I was along that stretch of PIE circling the central catchment area.
So I started speeding, 100 maybe 105 in order to get off the highway faster... And just nice, I saw a TP bike pass me. Blue red lights flashing, and I was asked to stop be the roadside.
I thought oh no... I'll have to wait longer, and indeed I did. The tp was at his bike for a good 5 minute or so? By then my stomach was in great pain.
The shit thing was, when the tp finally came to my window, my bowels really couldn't take it anymore and everything came out. I was so grossed out by what happened, that I vommitted... Out the window, on the tp's pants.
The tp was taken aback and took a while to register what was happening.
But in the end, long story short, I had come down with some bad food poisoning. Had to sit on the side of the road because the tp assessed that it wasn't safe for me to continue driving, had to wait for an ambulance to get me to the hospital, had to pay for extra towing to get my car to a cleaner, and I probably have to pay 400-500 to clean my car. The car will probably never smell right again too.
Fml. At least I didn't get a fine for speeding.

Dude... after reading your post, I can't help but budge in and just have to offer you my thoughts. Take it with a pinch of salt, or dont take it at all. But I hope what I share to you might help you a little bit more on your dating journey.
Long story short, The girl-friend that you have been in contact with for a while now, I don't think she's into you, at least based on your story. If a girl is interested in you, she will never, and I mean, NEVER ask you up front whether you have a crush on her, if at all. The one thing you must understand is that girls are never direct or straightforward with the guys they like. In your case, it is obvious that you have been showing her too many hints that you are crushing on her pretty bad. And if she asks you the question, it just means that she has been suspecting this for a long time, and confirmed this with your confession. In my opinion, you have lost this game, and now your ""crushing"" fate is all up to her mercy. You fell right into her bait; she may now choose what to do with you however she wishes. Even if she likes you back just a little bit, does not mean that she is willing to be tgt with you. Girls require a lot more than mere ""crushes"" to be in a relationship with someone. Hell, even if a girl hates you to the core, she may still want to be together with you if you do the game right ---> Now this is why a lot of girls end up with abusive boyfriends.
The number one rule in dating game is never, never ever confess your feeling to the opposite sex. Whoever confess first, basically admit defeat and resigned their fate to the other's hands. I can go on and on about what you can do, and should have done but anyway a lot of ppl are probably going disagree with me; besides, everyone has their own relationship journey. So I wish you luck with yours and take this post with a pinch of salt. Hopefully I am wrong and you will have closed the deal in the next few weeks. :) OR better, just move on and find a new target cuz this girl is just going to play the long game with you. It's not worth the time. Singapore is small but not that small.
Tl;dr: gg bro.

60160,106197,"My mom has always been criticising my looks/ figure since I was young and that made me have very low self esteem about my image. She would comment things like - my hip looks big, my buttocks too round, my thighs have too much cellulite, and I don’t have small and nice waist and that whatever I wear looks terrible on me because of my terrible figure. Because of her criticisms, I tend to go on extreme diets and exercise extensively. Obviously this is not sustainable. I “deflate” fairly quickly but also “inflate” again when I ate. Things got slightly better after I moved out. Though I gradually learn to accept how I look, I still feel slightly self conscious about my figure, would avoid wearing tight fitting clothes and occasionally still had to intentionally drill into my head that health is all that matters. Recently we had some family weddings to attend and I met my mom at the wedding and she started commenting that I looked the biggest she had ever seen and emphasised repeatedly how terrible I am for not keeping a good figure. She compared me to other guests and said kept repeating that if only I made effort I would look gorgeous like so and so. She went on commenting on how big my tummy and arms look on the pictures we took at the wedding. (FYI I’m about 155cm and about 50kg- not obese kind but also not the typical skinny girl kind) When I tried to disregard her comments, she told me that because she truly cares for me and hence she’s telling me the truth. She added that everyone else would just be nice to say I look pretty but that is not the truth. It’s like a nightmare repeating itself and I can’t help feeling so lousy and bad about myself again… even entertained thoughts like going on extreme diets/ taking weight loss pills or whatever that would help me be smaller!

60174,106226,"Hi. Asking for rs advices.
Frankly speaking, I am afraid to get into relationship. Because everywhere I go, I meet this expectation of ""traditional man"" but the females control everything/can do anything they want without labels
Example 1: My dad do all the household chores and work. My mom earns more than him by a thousand more per month and she complains he useless man. Like come on?? He is doing both work and home leh. And whenever they argue, my mom will get physically abusive sometimes + constantly verbal insults.
Example 2: My dates. I went on dates with quite a few females, but never settled for relationship. In a nutshell, 80% of the girls are quite self-entitled and expect man to follow/give in/pay for them. 10% are strong independent young woman and the other 10% are just DTF that I avoid. The 80% makes me want cry and vomit blood liao
Example 3: Friends' relationship. They always so scared of their girlfriend and let the girls carry their balls sia. Every decision, even hanging out with friends also need ask girlfriend. The heck sia.
Example 4: Female friends. I know a lot of girls. But every time I argue with them, when I wrong I will admit. But they wrong hor, IMPOSSIBRUH for them to apologize sia. If not they will say ""Sorry BUT-"" and then the singing comes.
Accepting this is a bit of a fact, I am in a dilemma whether to be one of those who eventually settle down and be like my poor dad. Or just be monk and chant Amitabha daily. Guys, got any advice or not?

But I'm not pretty in any way. 6-7/10 at best. (not my personal rating but my siblings) 7 is personally stretching it imo
The other guys who used to like me and some whom I dated are handsome as well. But I find that the more handsome someone is, the higher likelihood of ghosting.
I have to admit I have ghosted in recent years as well so that may just be karma.
Friends and Family do keep me very fulfilled but I've always felt there's a missing gap somewhere. I know I'm trying to reach the stars at this point but I haven't had much luck dating in recent years.

But I soon realise it's actually quite hurtful to the girl, especially if you've been talking for like weeks.

60150,106183,"Should I go for looks or not?
This question is probably gonna enrage a lot of people but there is a deeper reason as to why I ask this question. Please read the whole story before you answer.
First of all, I agree compatibility and personality is the most important thing. I would still reject the prettiest girl if she has a terrible attitude. In reality, I have never met some who is 100% perfect for me. The way I see it, are we compatible for the most part? And for the parts that we are not-compatible, am I able to deal with them? I feel that is a more realistic way of approaching compatibility/personality.
Now, a little bit of backstory before we get to the meat. I am ugly or at least, that has been what I was told for a long time. I was bullied a lot since young. I cannot even describe the pain I went through. Now, thinking about it, I think my experience resulted in 2 things.
First, I was, for the lack of the correct word, ""kind"" and ""sensitive"". People naturally steer to become friends with good-looking, class clown, popular, etc. people. One the other hand, I would try to become friends with the so-called ""loners/losers"" even when I had chances to hang out with top of the group. For example, in our soccer team (ugliness doesn't matter much), I was a decent player but I saw that there was a dude who was looked down because he was not good at the sport and he was always alone. I decided to give him company instead and become his good friend instead.
I also helped people a lot, in a lot of instances, ending having to do some form of self-sacrifice (which can draining at times). Why? Because I suffered and I did not want anyone to go through the same or any other kind of horrible experience.
Second, I started to put ""limits"" on myself because I felt as though people will not accept me (because of my ugliness). The fear stopped me from trying a lot of things. For example, I like dancing (amateurish-ly) and I was contemplating whether to join such a cca. Somehow, I plucked the courage to go for it. When I went to the cca open house, the girl at booth gave me look (only way to describe it is ""huh, this guy want to join this cca?"") and she only gave me one-word responses. When another good looking freshmen came, she immediately became cheerly and started explaining membership, pricing, etc on her own. I did not feel welcomed so I left.
If you are still here, then thanks. Let's get to the meat. Everyone around me expects me to get together with an ugly girl because of how I look. To prove everyone wrong, I set myself the lifetime goal of marrying a really beautiful girl, without compromising on personality of course. Of course, I wanted it as well but my past suffering fuelled my desire greater.
Oh boy, I had no idea what was about to happen....
I met this really beautiful girl, fake name ""Jess"", who was also extremely kind hearted. There were multiple guys trying to approach her in our office. I wasn't close to her but I saw do some really kind things which a lot people won't do. She seemed perfect, I mean, she checked all the boxes for me. However, we weren't close because she was in another team at work. I also didn't see her often.
Then, fate decided to screw me over. I met another girl, fake name ""Melody"", at an event via a friend. She was not pretty and she was also overweight but she was a good person too. During one of the dinner, she confessed to our group that she was feeling down because of her lack of success in romantic aspect. I knew what she was going through and I re-felt all the pain that I felt over the years. I felt bad for her. I was affected for about a week. I decided that I would sacrifice my lifetime goal to give her a chance and thought that I would ask her out at the end of the week (basically, the ""kind"" part of me taking over me).
Re-enter the beautiful Jess. She had come to me to clarify about something. When i talked to Jess, I felt my desire for lifetime goal come back and I felt excited. I saw an opportunity to spend time with Jess. Else, I can ask someone else to work with her. I was actually conflicted whether to go with Melody or Jess. I had the perfect girl in front of me, maybe fate decided to give me a chance? Why waste it?
I have always had this ""limit"" on me so I thought maybe it is time to break it for once in my life.
I decided to not ask Melody out and instead, try my luck with Jess.
My strategy was simple. I will show Jess my ""personality"" and let it do the work for me. I am sure Jess, such a kind hearted person, will like me for my personality instead of my looks. However, Jess seemed in uninterested in our discussions. She also did not really laugh at my jokes which made no sense to me. Even my boss laughs at my jokes. She seemed like a ""dead fish"". Her whatsapp messages to me were aIso bland whereas mine was funny, at least suppose to be funny. She never asked anything about me. I finally realised that she was not interested in me when I saw using her dating app as I always thought she was not actively seeking love.
I also realised that our personalities collided a bit but I am naturally someone who is more understanding and gives in, so I somehow managed to get it to work.
However, I had to continue to work with her so things continued. I cannot say everything here but it was clear as daylight she was not even remotely interested in me and every time something happened to show that, it would be heart-breaking for me. Then, I saw her fawning over an intern who was quite hot and that is when it hit me, looks do matter over personality.
There was a point in time where she struggled a lot. I stepped in and did my self-sacrificing thing again (""kind"" part of me again), knowing very well that she wouldn't love me. However, things changed from then on, she started to open up more and suddenly, she started to send me funny messages. She also started to talk to me from time to time on her own. She would share her personal stories. I finally got to see her ""fun"" side.
Actually, all it actually meant was that, I was a good friend. Last time, I was a person she had to work with but now, I am good friend. I still kept on seeing instances where she was not interested in me.
At the end, we had a major disagreement at work and we fought. I tried multiple times to reconcile but she did want to fix the situation and it ended up with us parting ways.
Then, fate decided to stab my heart with the most ironic rod possible. Just like any other idiot, I went to stalk her social media after our fall out. Then, I found something that made me feel even more sad. I found her old photo and saw that she was actually fat a few years ago. I also found a few photos of her without makeup where she looked average.
I asked myself if Jess comes to me today being fat and looking average, would I still want to be with her? With our colliding personalities?
The answer is yes because I think I have really fallen in love with her.
My original reason for posting this post was to ask if I had to pick someone, Melody or Jess (before interacting with either of them), who should I pick to go out with? Both of their personalities are fine. One is out of feeling sad for the person whereas the other one was based on desire (but superficially, by looks)
However, I think the more I wrote, I let my emotions run over the whole thing and it became what it is.....
All it shows is that I am stupid......and I will most probably give up looks and do some self-sacrificing nonsense again....

Now I no longer have a group of friends or even my best friend to meet up with anymore.
My best friend is also part of the clique, she still is now. We stopped catching up on each other, and now we dont even talk anymore. I kind of put most of the blame on her as I felt she wasn't reciprocating the same energy I was giving. Back then, I would bake cake on her birthday, get her presents and stuff but she doesn't. Sometimes she forgot about my birthday as well. But seeing her surrounded by friends and all, I am wondering is it just me? What is wrong with me that I can't manage to keep my friends?

60179,106242,"As a working adult who has been in the office world for about 4 years since graduation, I think I finally understand why I am so depressed with my current life and miss my army and uni days so much. Just one word, bros.
These years in the corporate world, the toughest thing has not perhaps been the work, or adjusting to working life vis-a-vis student life. It is no longer having ""bros"" around with you all the time anymore. The same kind of camaraderie of army or uni days is impossible to form at the workplace, ppl have their own agendas and focused on climbing the ladder and all the related office politics, or they don't want to mix work with personal, or they just see work as work and colleagues are not friends (fair point).
I know my bros are still there, but the truth is that friendships mostly don't end in dramatic ""you betrayed me"" fashion. It's ppl drifting apart, slowly, the harsh reality of priorities setting in. Want to meet ppl is no longer a spontaneous ""eh tonight supper/eh tonight drink aimai"" thing, it's like setting up a work meeting, eh does Friday work for you, what about Sunday afternoon, etc. Hanging out together as a gang no longer happens, usually it is a smaller meet up, at most a yearly thing. Instead of creating new memories together, all these meetups tend to end up being mere reminiscing of the past.
Ppl will say, this is life, this is the next phase. You lose friends. I don't disagree at all. But if the only options ahead of me for the rest of my life are (a) being married and spending the rest of my life with 1 woman and possibly pop out a kid or two, or (b) remain single for the rest of my life, all the while with a boring office job. then I cannot help but feel depressed , because the best days of my life and well and truly behind me.
I'm somewhat envious of the foreign workers who live together in dormitories. Communal living. Yes I know, it's hard as shit work, but they live together, eat together, sleep together, drink together. Shouting together. Doing crazy shit together. I miss that. Maybe I shd get a more exciting career. Most important is a job that allows me to stay in, something ppl usually hate in army but I realise, is so good.

After seeing the posts on Facebook about how the person being a top achiever for multiple months in sales commissions from a big property group, I was wondering if I should approach the person for my housing needs.
However, I did a background check using the person's agent registration number and found out there were literally zero records of any transactions, from sales of hdbs, rental, buying, etc. As such, I decided to talk to other agents and do background checks, before engaging a seasoned agent rather than approach that acquaintance.
Just wondering, were the posts for being a top achiever for multiple months by that acquaintance real?
I feel that a lot of agents nowadays claim to have a lot of experience in sales and closing a lot of deals but when you go check their credentials, turns out they have nothing recorded. This trend is already true for at least 5 other agents I talked to. Please do your checks before believing in the words of an agent about their so-called experience.

60217,106314,"This girl I am not close to is dating a very manipulative guy who's also a closeted narcissist. The guy is notorious within campus for sleeping around and idolising others who have different sexual partners for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He has also cheated on her on several occasions. Meanwhile, the girl is a good christian church-goer and probably doesn't know what a monster he is yet since he tends to hide it well at the start, slowly cutting off her support circle and alienating her from friends and family until she is entirely reliant on him before unleashing his ugly side. If she knew that this guy sleeps around with both men and women (he's bi), and that he drove at least two of his exes to attempt suicide when they saw the light and stopped tolerating his bs, I'm sure she would think twice before starting any rs with him. As I don't know the girl personally, I can only watch her become his next prey and hope she won't be emotionally and mentally destroyed by this monster. It is only a matter of time though. When will his bad deeds come to light? He has a high IQ and has always been very careful in curating his online image so it is difficult to collect evidence of his nonsense since he is careful to not break any laws. Such human scum to have hurt so many people in his life without any consequence. Hope karma will get him one day since he is good at choosing his targets, who tend to be quite vulnerable due to low self-esteem or other family issues.

60166,106210,"Its been about 6 months since the break-up of our 7 years relationship. I remember myself giving it my all to him, but in return he cheated on me three times in the relationship. I remember myself in shock when he couldn't even choose between me or that third party. I remember him telling our mutual friends that the reason we broke up was because of generic reasons such as the relationship being toxic but its because of his cheating. I remember he told me that he is taking a break from having relationships after breaking up with me, but at the next moment he's already with someone else.
To the one that cheated - I hope that you are happy now with your new partner, and you're done lying and cheating.
To the 3rd party - I hope you understand that if he can cheat on me for you, he will also cheat on you for others.
F it all.

60168,106213,"I’m in my 20s and already showing some signs of aging. Prior to this, I have already have hair loss and now, I find that wrinkles have appeared around my eyes and my face skin has started to sag. I look so different from my friends of similar age and I have a hard time accepting it. While the 20s is supposed to be the prime of a person’s life physically, it has affected my mental health almost every day thinking about it. I was mistaken for a mid aged uncle often and it hurts me. I am considering cosmetic/ aesthetic treatments to fix my hair and face once and for all and I have gotten some quotes. Other than the initial treatment, the doctors said continued maintenance is needed to keep the new look and the most conservative quote runs into the low 5 figures, which is more than 70% of my savings. I initially have plans to use the savings for future house/ settling down (no gf right now due to my looks) but this issue keeps clouding my mind and I’m in no state to even start a rs at this point. Is it worth trading my money for looks in my case?

Recently I mentioned I have a business account with a following of xx,xxx followers. It's just a part time for extra income where I do ads for a small fee and didn't see the need to mention it early in the relationship. He got upset that I ""kept a secret"" and said what's the point if I'm not making much money and that I should give it up and focus on my studies.
He does not use social media, his last post was over 5 years ago and he's been using the same profile pic since he created his account. So he doesn't see the point of trying to make money out of it. I am upset by his lack of support and how he chided me. I agree it's not going to be my bread and butter but I'm making some money now. So what's the issue? Is this a red flag?

And she started chatting with me as if things didn’t changed or happened. (How do I pretend that I was okay with this?) Through another mutual friend, I found out she was now single. Nevertheless, I still went ahead to meet her and the long lost clique reunion (we haven’t hanged with each other for years!). It was awkward, really awkward. It felt different too. I couldn’t pretend I was okay. I didn't turn up for future clique meetings. I texted her to meet and talk things out but got ghosted. The clique is still hanging now, going on trips, and attending milestone events. I hate myself that I still miss her so much, and all the times we had together. I keep wishing that we would be friends again one day. How do I let this go? It is almost a decade since we first drifted.

I’ve looked through and signing on offers pretty competitive salaries. In my field in the private sector, my pay will lag behind at least for the first few years. I was an officer during NS and while I am not that passionate about the military, I think I can do a reasonably well job. The most important thing to me is job stability as i just want to settle comfortably into a job when I find a suitable one. Having a reasonable pay would be the second criteria. But I don’t know if I would be missing out on anything if I were to sign on as my first job. Can anyone advise me?

60201,106287,"#8775: Being a local seller in Singapore and the customers you meet
I am a shopowner (graduating from university fr a couple of years ) running a small business relating to house renovation.
Recently I have met with a customer (a couple) who purchased their lighting fixtures from me. As they have no interior designer( for a condo) ,they requested me to provide them with a contact number of installation company . As I have been in this line for a couple of years ,I know of an electrician whom I have worked with (we are not partners and I don't take a single cent from him for introducing his service) , just that I saw it's a first time owner ,I told them to contact the installation company themselves and check with them on the price themselves as my company doesn't do installation. (I wouldn't know the cost of the installation as I do not take a cut from introducing and I just do it out of goodwill)
In the end , there was some extra works to be done and there was extra cost incurred .I replied I'm in no way involved in the installation as I purely only sell the product itself and if they are not comfortable with the extra charges ,they can choose not to use the installer and find someone else. But they probably find it too troublesome and proceed with the installation. At the end of the installation ,as they have no outlet to vent their frustration,the customer called me and scream at me and message me to inform me they left me a very bad review of my business on google .
Sometimes I feel very baffled and puzzled by the fact that people can make use of our kindness to their advantage. The feeling is like ,you thought u were doing a kind deed to help someone by going out of your way to provide a contact point ,but they blame it on you when there is a charge incurred from them not communicating properly with the installer.
I feel like telling them that if they don't use an interior designer ,at least make the effort to ask the installator to come up and view your house and give you a proper quotation instead of blaming it on others when things didn't go their way. And you can't expect someone to do this work for you as this is your own house.
I feel like after this experience ,I have the fear of helping others again.
Can someone please enlighten me as I feel really disappointed at human nature.
School never taught such complexity in human nature before.

My mum asked me few days back why I don't go to sleep early.
My reply as follow:
My room is near the kitchen. And beside it is a corridor. Any footsteps I'll know. Any lights that are turned on in the kitchen I'll know. I can't close my door cos you said so. You will ask why I close my door. So I don't close my door.
My sis room's light shines in the direction that I sleep. And though she can close her door, she just leaves a gap there and that thin ray of light is still visible. And I still can't close my door. Granted I have a mini curtain at the entrance of my door but still it doesn't keep the lights out.
And the neighbours. We have neighbours randomly shouting vulgarities at no one occasionally in the middle of the night. Making noise at the void deck. And some gaming action with low base boom boom being audible even with their windows shut. Plus I have growing insomnia ever since uni.
I can't wear ear plugs without risking not hearing my own phone alarm. So I still can hear random sounds all around.
My mother looked back at me and laughed. Topic was changed and we talked about what to eat for lunch. The art of switching topics. I need to learn it.

I am struggling with my friend.
I dont hate my friend. I do love and care about this person.
However, my friend has a tendency of shutting off whenever things get bad.
I have been supporting my friend for some time which was draining. At one point, my friend cut me off an opportunity. I told this person that it was unfair to me but the person continued anyway. The person also had a tendency of stonewalling at times.
I was unhappy because I felt taken advantage of.
I did the silent treatment for a couple of weeks but the person just ignored it.
After that, I tried to clear things out with this person because in the end, I still valued the person.
I tried to explain make that I felt hurt and drained by the person's actions but the person kept saying that the person doesnt understand.
I tried explaining in different ways multiple times over months.
At one point of time, the person said that me trying to clear things out was a waste of time. I was super pissed off and I told the person all the sacrifices I made for the person and called the person ""selfish"" for calling me a waste of time.
We did not talk again for a while.
I felt bad and I tried to clear things out but then again, we got into a fight (same issue). The person stonewalled and ignored me completely while I kept texting the person not to hurt me like this (ignore me as if I am worthless and insignificant).
In the end, I gave up and blocked the person.
I dont know what I could have done better. I already tried to explain the situation multiple times till I couldnt take it. As a last resort, I did the name-calling and silent treatment.
I understand that calling the person ""selfish"" and doing silent treatment are toxic.
I dont want to hurt ppl by doing toxic things.
I do care about the person but that doesnt mean I am fine being treated unfairly. I am feeling super hurt now.
How could I have handled the situation better?
Also, how do I process and deal with the hurt (from being ignored and from being cut off the opportunity)?

It is really scamming people frequently these days and I'm very annoyed. In their games you can win product vouchers. I got one, and immediately after that the seller removed the product from their shop, now I'm left with a voucher of no use. I spoke to the seller and they said it's sold out, they don't know when it's coming back and since the voucher is from Shopee they said ask Shopee. As of today it has been several weeks. Within these weeks I have approached Shopee multiple times with alternatives like how about another similar product? I don't mind another equivalent, doesn't have to be that one. They said no, the voucher is only for this product that NO LONGER EXISTS. What a joke. Also this is the third time that this has happened. Any of you experienced the same? Am I the a**hole for being angry?
How many of you won't be mad at this? Gamers out there imagine this - you invest time/money on your games right? Imagine you press upgrade or you won a boss, but at the end of it you see no change to your level, inventory or xp. Then when you ask customer service they tell you that they can't do anything even though it's their game. You can only wait till they feel like it.
Also auntys and uncles you buy Toto 4D right? Imagine you win, then the counter says oh we ran out of prize money so you wait, when we have money we let you know again. And the timeline for when you'll get your prize is unknown. How many of you would be chill about that? Seriously?

However, here are certain things I realised about my boss (even though he is quite a nice person) and makes me wonder if its red flag. First of all, he is a workaholic and although by words he say he will not pressure us, but somehow that makes us feel like we should work harder (he does not say it explicitly in a way). Also, he mentioned that he’s an alpha male during a one to one review session, making me wonder if he is hinting to me that I should better follow his ideas and thoughts. He expressed that he would want people to take and follow his instructions. Among colleagues in a group setting, he will also repeatedly mention things which links to our personal issues such as our dating life or wealth. One example would be that as he is from a well to do family, he will tend to say things like ‘go buy a car’ as if anyone can afford to buy it easily. Some statements he made might not be explicit, but it tends to make me feel like he has another meaning behind it. When discussing about work stuffs, he will doubt my words and questions me, making me feel like I do not make sense (maybe I might be a little sensitive about this but it feels like he don’t trust me). Overall, the vibes with him just feels off and at times quite forceful. Not sure if I should continue with the job as I feel like my boss might not value me, even though I enjoy working my my other colleagues.
