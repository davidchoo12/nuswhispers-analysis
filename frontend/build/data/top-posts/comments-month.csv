When is the best time to ask about the guy’s salary and net worth? I really wanna ask the exact figure as financial security is important to me. I don’t want to ask too early as I don’t want to as money minded or gold digger. But I can’t drag too late either as I am dating to marry and I don’t want to find out late that he is earning way lower than me or not enough to support a family.

60413,106739,"Sayonara Singapore.
I came to Singapore 15 years ago, thinking of making Singapore my home, as it came on top choices compared to other countries, such as US, Australia and Canada. I have studied here and meet my wife here and had my baby here, however Singapore had a different plan. I am a PR for more than 10 years and they are not ready to give my wife a PR even though she has studied here and been here almost same time as me and they rejected application my wife's and my child's PR. So HDB is out of choice. We both make a combined income of 10k+ but more and more money is squeezed out of us. Looks like Singapore Values free money from China and Hong Kong than integrating locally trained people.
At present our house house hold expenditure is more than 80% of our income and our life style is just average, so you can earn and have a decent life in Singapore. But we feel we are just Surviving here and not really living. We are not evening talking about luxury here like car, condo etc. Just a basic life. And it's same for my Singapore friends but slightly better because of HDB. In general, Singapore is becoming a advanced society with surviving people.
What I see from Govt plan is either you are super rich or under 3k family income rest all will just be rich on paper but poor in real life. All my class mates (locals) have already left Singapore and I didn't listen to their advice to pack up 10 years ago. Now, I am Surviving. When I tell about these things , most locals will complain you can go back where you came from, but if we keep having such mentalities Singapore will become next Japan.
Right now, govt is happy to collect millions from foreigners ABSB and giving $300 CDC vouchers to keeps locals mouth shut. So, till govt doesn't prioritise welfare of people, Sg will be millionaires zombie land.

60392,106699,"How can I reject my boyfriend's marriage proposal in the least hurtful way possible? I (25F) and my boyfriend K (26M) have known each other since JC and have dated for 4 years. He has always been good to me, treats me well, and I have no doubt that he loves me very much. Recently, I heard from a friend that he has been shopping around for engagement rings and planning for a surprise proposal. Although this should have been happy news for most girls, I actually felt worried, sad and confused instead.
The truth is, deep down inside I fear that I may have already fallen out of love with K. All my life I have been an (almost) straight As student and usually scored in the top 10-20% of the cohort. I am quite ambitious and competitive in my outlook, and some might even call me an overachiever. Since graduation, I have secured a pretty cushy job that pays close to 5 digits with high hopes for my future career progression.
K is quite the opposite academically. Back in school he was a bit of a joker and would rather spend his days hanging out with friends than revising. Although he was in a good school, his grades consistently scraped the bottom of the barrel and he said he ""just wasn't cut out for studying"". Despite this, K actually has very lofty goals and holds himself to (his own) high standards. He has always talked about his dreams of making it big as an entrepreneur and to be his own boss by the age of 30.
Although I desperately want to be supportive of his dreams, honestly I find many of his business ideas naive, ill-conceived and financially unfeasible. I tried my best to rescue several of his past ""big ideas"" by helping him research business regulations, liaise with industry partners etc. Yet, all of them turned a massive flop because they were fundamentally flawed to begin with. As he fast approaches 30, I think reality is sinking in that he is unlikely to reach his goal and will be stuck in his 3k/month admin job forever. In the past year or so, he has been showing signs of depression such as chronic oversleeping and self-destructive thoughts which has further sucked him into a downward spiral. I suspect that his pride is also wounded by the ever-widening gap between our life trajectories as he would refuse to come to company D&Ds with me as my +1.
I feel that my love for K has been slowly whittled down by the endless cycle of his doomed entrepreneurial ventures. I am exhausted from juggling multiple hats as girlfriend, therapist and business consultant. At the risk of sounding materialistic, I also find it hard to see a future with him buying a house and raising kids with equal financial contributions as I will probably end up paying for the bulk of it while also trying to protect his pride. With that being said, I will always care deeply for K given all the happy times we have shared together and everything he has done for me. He is a good and kind man who truly loves me with all of his heart, and I don't want to crush him completely especially given the current rut he is in. How can I let him down as gently as possible about his plans for a proposal, and would it be cruel for me to ask for a break/ a break up now?

I can't get away from the guilt and pain from the loss. Coming from a single parent family, my mom had worked her whole life bringing my brother and me up. Now at her old age, my mom is still working and did not even have $20k in her savings, and yet, i squandered away $50k just like that. The money lost could have improved my mom's quality of life and perhaps, allow her to not work so hard now. The guilt has been eating me up daily.

Her perspective is like, lowball or what, she doesnt unds, hv money go work, people looking for jobs shld get any job they can. Then I ask her, so you want me to be depressed and low pay? Then my mum said, still got pay what, how difficult can the work be, isn't it just typing (tech job btw), dont think too much wont be depressed, interview say OT and weekend work just scaring ppl, wont happen one. She has only worked pt jobs w low qualifications so she dont unds me, like at all. And she die die dont believe me when I said OT work no extra pay, she kept insisting that OT work is good cos got extra money.
Everyday is like this. ""Pay ok what, any pay just say yes la, there is no pay that is low, the companies know what to pay you, dont big mouth. Work tiring meh? Sit down get fat only, move fingers. Unhappy resign also ok what, got money"". Wha she so money minded I really cannot tahan. Everything is money money money, not like we living in rental flat or damn poor.
Ok I really dont unds her and it's not like I'm shaking my legs at home or not paying my part of the bills, she keeps nagging me to find any job, like literally 2k also ok range to her. How to get through to her idk. Other parents hv high expectations of their kids, then there's mine, 2.5k is very good for a degree holder, on the other extreme end.

60446,106789,"After reading #106752, I'm deeply troubled by the hint of xenophobia inside. The supportive comments below that post and number of likes makes me wonder if Singapore is actually a welcoming place to foreigners.
A short introduction about me. I'm a year 3 EE student. I'm from another Asian nation, took the tuition grant too and have to work in Singapore after graduation.
I'm deeply grateful to the Singapore government for offering me this opportunity. My home country does not have good universities and it has been my dream to study abroad in a good university especially one as good as NUS. I remembered being extremely overjoyed when I was accepted to NUS with this grant as my family would not have afforded to pay the full fees otherwise.
I still have some time before graduation but I can understand the stress that the OP in #106746 is facing. For #106752 to put him/her down with such strong words is totally uncalled for as you Singaporeans may not grasp how much it took for us to get here.
Singaporeans have it relatively easy to enter NUS. For outsiders like me, we have to top our high schools, brush up our English to get good scores for IELTS or TOEFL to even have a remote chance of getting in. After we get offered, it's a big change for us to move to a foreign land, study a degree that is not our first language with no family support.
With this additional stress for us to find a job after we graduate if not we have to fork out huge damages, in a job market that is stacked against us, I can understand OP is frustrated and fearful. We should be more emphatatic.
The minimum we ask for is a fair chance to consider us. We are people seeking a better life just like you. If SGP government didn't think we can add value to the Singapore economy, we would not have been offered the TFG.

I decided to ask one HR why and she bluntly told me it's because I'm not a Singaporean. There is a govt quota in place and thus have to prioritise the hiring of Singaporeans. Even drastically lowering my salary expectations has not helped.
I'm extremely demoralised and fearful. I need to serve a bond after I graduate but it seems I'm not given the opportunity to do so. Job should be given based on ability not nationality. At least let me get the foot in the door to prove my worth. All the talk that Singapore is a welcoming cosmopolitan city with opportunities seems to be a lie.

Does this really help in the reduction of accident rates? What is worse is that not many people uses them, hence it is kinda inefficient for people who are in a rush.

60410,106731,"Today will be my last day in Singapore for a long time.
This is my (33M) first time posting on NUSWhispers so do forgive me if my formatting looks weird ah. Growing up I always wanted the Singaporean Dream, to find a nice girl, get married, have kids, BTO in a decent neighborhood, etc. But life is unexpected and I found myself more and more detached as time went by - let me just share why.
One of the first wake-up calls was when I was discussing getting a BTO with my ex. When we actually looked at the figures, we realised that if we wanted to balance saving for old age and paying off loans, it would take a good couple decades to pay off everything. Renovations, furniture, etc... the figures added up and it looked really daunting. For us folks with a more humble background (3-4k take home), this was a subtle reality check- at one point we looked at our finances and decided with heavy hearts that we might not be able to fulfil our dream of having kids before 35. It was during COVID that our relationship was fraught with more financial difficulties, and we parted amicably.
The pandemic was a double-edged sword. I managed to keep my job, but the workload only got worse even though I was working from home. I was at home, there but not there. I believe I can speak for almost everyone in my age group when I say that we all became jaded and upset with our lives and our jobs during that period. The rat race only intensified for my colleagues and I, and I kept asking myself- is this the Singapore Dream?
During that time, I was dating actively on Tinder. I found that many Singaporean girls are just too similar to each other, and in a fashion that wasn't to my taste. Yes, Singaporean guys only hike and gym. But Singaporean girls always have the same movie quotes or some random MBTI/Horoscope sign on their Tinder profile. They have the same interests and conversations. Political views were never diverse- in fact, many girls don't think about politics, as it isn't their interest. I don't think we can blame anyone for that- Singapore is just too small, and lacks space for us to explore hobbies and interests. We all end up liking the same stuff, watching the same shows, and we all end up feeling that a trip to Don Don Donki is an adventure. But after breaking up with whom I thought I would spend my life with, I felt like I didn't want to lower my bar anymore.
I had a friend who went to Israel during his NOC days and stayed there afterwards for his work. I visited him there once the pandemic died down, and he introduced me to a friend of his whom we hit off right away. I have to say, when the folks in Israel talk about equality, they mean equality. She laughs at the Singaporean girls who say that females shouldn't need to serve National Service. She refuses to be stuck in a rat race and chooses to spend her limited time in her 30s taking care of her ailing parents. She is refreshing, unlike any girl whom I've met before in Singapore. I was smitten. The months flew by, and before I knew it, I had already made plans to join her there. I have gotten a job offer and I will be flying towards Israel tonight.
I will be moving there to pursue a new way of life, a new job and hopefully a new place to stay until my old age. I will miss the small things in Singapore- the efficient MRT, my favourite Saizeriya (yes, maybe this is the reason I was dumped hahaha), the top quality Roti Coin at Kembangan MRT. But I think that this Chapter of my life in Singapore is at an end. I look forward to my new life in a new place!!

Person A is shy but made the effort to confess to me. He is a wonderful guy, with a slight difference in lifestyle. I can tell the amount of effort he puts into me, and he is really everything I am looking for. He is the type to accompany me to watch the sunset and study when I am alone. He also helps me with anything I require assistance with. I feel really comfortable with him whenever we hang out. He makes an effort to talk to me and tries not to end the conversation. However, I love humorous guys, and he is not all that funny. Sometimes I find him boring. But I do like him because he is really nice and treats me really well. I know that if I get together with him, I will love him back and treat him well too. But I also know that I might get irritated when he's boring or nags.
Person B is shy too, but did not make the effort to confess to me. I only knew that he liked me from our mutual friends. He is really tall and cute. I initiated the conversation with him, and I was attracted to him from the first time I talked to him. He's really funny, and he makes me laugh all the time. We can click very well too. But he is not the type to accompany me whenever I am alone. I created the opportunity to be alone with him and asked him to study and eat with me, only to get disappointed as he joined our mutual friend group for study dates. We don't chat as often, and he often leaves me on read. We have similar lifestyles, but it gets a little awkward when we are alone. I know that I like him more than Person A, but he is not treating me as well, and I'm worried that I will be hurt and disappointed while in the relationship.

For example she has them over at her house before and now when she's sick she doesn't allow me to even visit her or even on normal days she doesn't let me into her house because it's ""messy"".
She's had guys laid down on her lap and when I do the same she pushes me away.
She's has been to her exes house and when it comes to visiting mine, she declines most of the time because she feels embarrassed or paiseh.
She's had kisses with her dates when they aren't even an item and 3-4 months into the date. With me, when we first kissed 6 months into the rs (cos of religion reason) she felt so bad about it.

Cost of living was lower but so were salaries. Many in the workforce did not even have a diploma. Stuff like vacations and domestic helpers were luxuries. Mcdonalds and KFC meals were special treats.
Most flats were smaller and some families had 6-7 ppl cramping in a 2/3 room flat.
Taking photos were a big thing and videos were almost non-existent. Even so, most families dont own a camera. Unlike now where you can take hundreds of photos and videos on a single outing.
No netflix and youtube so you had to accept wtv was fed to you on tv.
No internet and mobile phones. School projects meant days and weeks of digging books in the library. No google and online reviews so finding a product or service was based on hearsay and referrals. No whatsapp and video calls so if you had someone who lived overseas, that once a week phone call was the only way of connecting with him. Buying stuff overseas was next to impossible unless you or someone flies there.

60425,106760,"Is it wrong to be rich?
I come from a middle class family, parents raised me up, put me through university, and now I’m out in the working world making a living for myself in corporate. Like many others, I share the Singaporean dream of climbing the corporate ladder and possibly striking the jackpot in Singapore pools.
As a sandwiched class of society, I have been observing people from different financial and socioeconomic backgrounds. I have friends who are less fortunate in life, with terminally ill parents and young siblings to support. I also have friends who are wealthy and comfortable, with wonderful parents helping them with their housing down payment and buying them a car upon graduation.
I too, like many others, aspire to be wealthy and provide a comfortable life for my kids in future. Which is why I understand why many parents from wealthy families “spoil” their children, because no parent will want to see their child struggle in life. As such, many outsiders will give comments such as “spoilt brat from rich family” or “privileged and silver spoon”.
Some of this children from wealthy families do actually appreciate their generational wealth and are humble. Some, not so much, and will splurge their parents money irresponsibly. But regardless of weather that wealthy child is humble, or one who is irresponsible, they will still be subjected to such labels.
I always see negative comments in Facebook and instagram posts, when it comes to wealthy people. Take for example the recent spotlight on dick Lee’s family putting their bungalow up for sale and donating 60 million to charity. Many, actually most, of the comments are saying that they are trying to evade taxes through their charitable deeds or just looking to be in the limelight and doing it for fame.
Another example is the case of Naomi Neo, a local influencer in Singapore. Whenever she splurge on her children, for example on the birthday for her daughter, people were just so toxic and negative in the comments.
Now bringing me back to the question, is it wrong to be rich? Because if being rich subjects me to such hate, it seems like a curse.

60390,106695,"Hi everyone, I am an NUS year 1 student, and also an NS GF. I am facing some issues as an NS GF and would like to get some advice from the public, especially from people of NUSWhispers since I have seen several NS stories on this platform. During the past 1 year, my BF has barely initiated calling me while he was in the army and I had eventually grown tired of always initiating it. His reasons were always that he was tired, busy, or whatever it could be, but I could catch him sometimes online on gaming platforms. I understand that calling everyday could be very uneventful or dreading for him as I feel that he has nothing to talk to me about, but I hope that he’d at least try to call me once a week if he wasn’t so tired. I asked some of my NS GF gals in one of my module and they told me that they often have conversations at night with their boyfriend, event if it was just for 5 minutes. My BF would also share his army stories with me when he books out and occasionally tells me stories through text if it was interesting enough for him to rush to share the story. However, despite appreciating that he is willing to share his stories with me, he always utilise army slangs despite me having already told him probably more than 10 times that I hoped he could use simpler terms because I am not familiar with the slangs that he was using with me. As a result, I find myself constantly searching online for the slangs and even asking my guy friends in class about the meaning behind those slangs that he was using as he does not try to explain to me what the slang means. For a real life example, the slang “turn out”, when questioned, would be explained by him as “basically like just turning out lo”… I really hope people of this page could give me advice on what I should do with this situation and how I can better improve this tragic barrier between us. Thank you in advance everyone.

60443,106781,"Good evening everyone
There’s something that I want to seek opinion on from you guys and it took me a long time to feel comfortable opening up to you guys online. So I am gonna start sharing it now.
My husband and I have been together for more than a decade. We are both individuals that really enjoy sex and we have it often 3-4 times a week. We have no intentions of having kids as we enjoy the financial freedom and time freedom of traveling where ever and whenever we want.
It was only recently that we realized that we are starting to age a bit. For example, being more prone to injuries as we both led a very active lifestyle with sports such as swimming, running, and hiking. We often have the common understanding that we should always cherish our time together with one another as time waits for no man.
Just a few days ago, I had lunch with a couple of my close friends that are slightly older than me. They all mentioned that they either stopped having intercourse or either did it once a year. I shared this with my husband and he was as shocked as I was.
As mentioned earlier, we both enjoyed the idea of cherishing our time together. Thus, I have suggested to my husband that maybe we could do a nude couple photo shoot together or maybe a sex tape together. (Pls do not judge) He agreed to the idea and our rationale was that because we both really enjoy sex and we only live once. We both want to keep a memory of something with both enjoy doing together regardless if it’s a photo or video. I mean it will not be long before our skin becomes wrinkly and our hair turns grey.
So I am curious what are some opinions you guys have and where I can do them professionally

60374,106661,"I’m an international student at NUS (white female American) and I would like to become a Singapore citizen. I grew up in Chicago and I always wondered if dense urban environments could ever be safe and clean, especially for a woman. I spent a summer here as a high school exchange student and I knew quickly that Singapore is a place I wouldn’t mind spending the rest of my life in. I tried living in Tokyo for a summer. Even though it was as clean and as safe as Singapore, there was no way I was going to fit into a non English-speaking society. I do not plan to go back to America. What are the chances that the Singapore government would award citizenship to a white American lady? I know of several Chinese Malaysians friends who have gotten citizenships without much difficulty. It would seem that culturally, Chinese Malaysians are the most obvious candidates for citizenship in Singapore. Would appreciate it if I could get some advice on whether my ethnicity and nationality would be a problem for citizenship. Thanks a lot!

She went telling my auntie how ""dirty"" i was and everyone in the family looked at me differently since then. When she had a bad day at work, she would rant at me and i became the ""anger management toy"" for her. She would kick and slap whenever she felt unhappy and when she is done, she act nothing happened and still had the cheek to ask if i was ok. When i ranted to my auntie, she sided my mum and told me how i could have acted differently. Last year,it turned out for the worst.
I went on a 3D2N staycation with my bf as it was our anniversary and my bf surprised me with it. She got so unhappy with it and threatened she would jump down. She called the hotel by pretending she was someone sending for ""delivery"" and asked under whose booking is this. I had enough of her nonsense so i stayed at my bf hse for a couple of months. She won't stop texting and calling and then calling my bf mum. I went home afterwards hoping to talk, but she slapped and kicked again till my face bled.
I left home afterwards and vowed to never her again. When i left house, many things rose again. She started playing the victim and calling my auntie and everyone else. So then everyone else called me hoping i would head back talk to my mum once again. I then known from a close friend that actually had cheated on my father throughout my 21 years of my life but my father chose not to say anything to protect the marriage.

60461,106818,"Everyone has a story, this is mine.
My dad passed away when I was a teenager. Before he fell sick he and my mom got a divorce. Their split was horrid and traumatic for me because I witnessed a lot of violent physical fights. I can still remember he held a knife and wanted to attack my mom. He swung and slammed the door into her and she let out a terrifying scream. Both of them are bad tempered and toxic towards each other. I witnessed all these when I was below the age of 10. I suffered from PTSD for years.
I remember feeling helpless and terrified whenever they start fighting. I forgot the number of times the police showed up because of all the yelling and screaming. Sometimes there's blood on the floor at the scene where they fought. This was how I remember the bulk of my childhood.
My mother is literally a crazy woman as a single parent. In today's day and age, I guess she can be called a bipolar, narcissist, borderline or maybe all of the above. She had no one to fight and argue with so she would regularly unleash all her emotions onto us, especially me, because I'm a female. When I hit puberty, she became more violent towards me. I was not rebellious. I studied hard, but she was never proud of me.
None of our needs mattered. All our birthdays were meant to celebrate her instead. Because that was the day she suffered to give birth to us. Every holiday was supposed to treat her like a queen because she deserves a break. She only cared about controlling us no matter how unreasonable and nonsensical the request is because we owe her our lives. She was not happy even when we followed her instructions. This was how I remember my teenage years.
I was always mentally preparing myself for her to explode on me. To be battered mentally and physically is the norm. There was no way out as I can't bear to leave my younger sibling alone with her. In a sense, I became a mother to my younger sibling. I fed and supported my younger sibling the moment I could because my mother abandoned all her responsibilities to 'find herself'.
She went on to have affairs with married men. Travelled out of sg for months, in the name of love. Lucky I already learnt how to cook by age 11. I remember bawling my eyes out when she left home with her luggage. I was 13. How tf do kids run a home for months without any adult? But we survived.
When her mood comes, she would go on a rampage and say we are cursed and we will grow up to lead the same kind of life like her. She hated our existence because she lost her freedom, her youth, her everything. For a while, I actually believed her that I should not exist.
Took me decades to understand why she hated me. I didn't end up having a lousy life as she expected. I found a job that I love and actually enjoy. I met someone, married and lived a totally different life from hers. I have long term friendships unlike her. All of us are leading peaceful lives now.
She is wrong about all of us.
Don't believe everything your parents tell you. They aren't always right. Never believe you are doomed to walk in their footsteps. There's always a chance to change your destiny.

60450,106796,"Unpopular opinion: I will probably be slayed for this but I think most women/girls especially those known for their ""looks"" are bad at carrying conversations.
I think because attractive women think as long they are pretty or gorgeous, they don't have to do anything else and that would be enough for guys. So, they don't need to make an effort in other areas as they are ""attractive"". As a result, their conversational skills become horrible.
P:S: They can be finely tuned to social cues but carrying a conversation is plain bad.

60436,106787,"Prof Ben just wrote a post on the good pay of CS grads yet at the same time not choose a course based on existing market conditions. Choose something we love to do blah blah..
I find his statements extremely disingenuous. Prof Ben seems stuck in his ivory tower with the good pay and iron rice bowl as an NUS Prof. I glanced at his resume, he has not worked much in the private sector if at all to be qualified to be making such statements.
Inflation is high, housing and rental prices are through the roof just to name a few. As much as we want to do what we like, wages have not kept up much in real terms for a long time. It is the most rational choice for young people to take a course that offers the best ROI.
Interest may be good, but putting food on the table and saving for a roof over your head is still a priority. Having more money gives you options to pursue whatever interest you may like.
CS is one of the few courses that has bucked this salary trend. High pay, work from home, good hours compared to jobs of similar tier like law or medicine. If you qualify for law or medicine but don't like them, take a CS degree. Plenty of people yearn to have a CS degree but do not qualify, you will be a fool for throwing that option away. If you have a CS degree but not working in software raking in big money, you are a fool too. If it is possible, give me your CS degree.
Only a minority of students can qualify for CS since the cutoff is a perfect A-level score. The people he is preaching to are the cream of the crop. What if my interest is in tech but just happens that I did not score a perfect result.
I did not have the luxury of having perfect A-level scores to enter CS so have to settle for an engineering major instead. Best I can try for is minor in CS and hopefully that is sufficient to get an IT job. Sucks to be born 10 years late if not I could have entered CS more easily.

I am a student at NUS, studying computer science. My parents got divorced when I was in high school and it was a tough time for me. They fought a lot, and at times, it would turn violent. I always felt scared and trapped in the middle of their arguments.
Growing up, my family struggled with low-income jobs and I couldn't afford tuition. It was hard for me to focus on my studies and I often felt overwhelmed. To make things worse, I had toxic friends who constantly bullied me for not having both parents. They would call me names and make fun of my family situation.
I started to feel the weight of their words and eventually developed depression and anxiety. I sought help from my school counselor, but it was not enough. I needed more support, but my parents were unable to provide it. I had to separate myself from my friend group, but in doing so, I found myself alone and isolated.
The thought of ending it all crossed my mind many times, but I pushed through, trying to find solace in my studies and hobbies. I had two boyfriends, but both relationships were short-lived. The first one played me and the second one had to end because his parents didn't approve.
Now, I feel like I have no one to turn to. I am alone, with no friends, no relationship, and no parents to support me. It takes a toll on me emotionally, but I try to focus on my future and my studies. I know that I have the potential to do great things and make a better life for myself, but it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when I feel so lost and alone.

60372,106655,"Don't mind my long story, but this is for all the current NUS students who feel overwhelmed and feel like dropping out.
My name is Mei Ling and I am a 22-year-old Chinese female studying medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS). My journey to becoming a doctor started when I was just a little girl, watching my grandmother struggle with a chronic illness. I was struck by the power of medicine and the difference that doctors could make in people's lives. I knew then and there that I wanted to become a doctor, to help others the way that my grandmother's doctors had helped her.
Growing up, I was a top student, constantly striving for excellence in everything I did. I was driven, ambitious, and passionate. So, when it was time to choose a career, medicine was the natural choice for me. I was determined to become a doctor and make a difference in the world.
But the journey to becoming a doctor has been far from easy. The Singapore education system is known for its high standards and intense pressure, but in the field of medicine, it's even more grueling. Every day feels like a race against time, with endless hours of studying, assignments, and exams. The competition is fierce, and the expectations are sky-high.
I used to love going to university, soaking up knowledge and expanding my horizons. But now, the thought of stepping foot on campus fills me with dread. I often find myself lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, and wondering why I am even there. The constant pressure to succeed has taken a toll on my mental health, and I feel like I am drowning in stress and exhaustion.
The constant comparisons to my peers only add to my stress. It seems like everyone around me is thriving, while I am just struggling to keep up. I have lost my sense of identity and my confidence has taken a hit. I used to be so sure of my path, but now I question everything. I often wonder if I am even cut out for this field, and if I will ever be able to meet the expectations placed upon me.
I have considered dropping out of NUS countless times. The thought of not having to worry about grades and expectations is incredibly tempting. However, I know that quitting is not the solution. I fear that it will only add to my feelings of failure and regret. I fear that I will look back on this time and regret not pushing through, not fighting for my dreams.
Despite my struggles, I am determined to find a way to overcome this burnout. I know that my passion for medicine and my drive to make a difference are still there, buried under the stress and exhaustion. I am searching for ways to rediscover my love for learning and regain my sense of purpose.
I have started seeking support from my professors and peers. I have also taken up mindfulness practices, such as meditation and yoga, to help manage my stress. I have realized the importance of self-care and have started setting aside time for myself to recharge and do things that bring me joy. Whether it's reading a good book, taking a walk in the park, or spending time with friends and family, I have learned to prioritize my well-being and prioritize myself.
I am slowly but surely making progress. I am beginning to rediscover my love for medicine and the reasons why I chose this path. I am regaining my confidence and finding my voice. The journey will not be easy, but I am determined to overcome this burnout and come out stronger on the other side.
I refuse to let the expectations of others define me and dictate my future. I am ready to take control of my life and forge my own path in the field of medicine. I am determined to become a doctor and make a difference in the world, on my own terms.
So if I am trying, you all can too!

It is true that the company allows leave to be carried forward but it is notoriously known that the ‘extra’ annual leave cannot be used in the end.
Thank you

60394,106701,"My boyfriend BMI is 36.7. We have dated for 4 years and since then he has gained over 20kg. Im always getting upset at his unhealthy lifestyle which he does not see it as a problem. We also always having arguments about it as he finds me very controlling and difficult when I tried to get him to change or modify some of these lifestyle habits.
He likes food and love to try many varieties of foods. However he doesnt like to exercise, which resulted in the significant weight gain. Covid-19 exacerbated the issue as he began to work from home. He does not usually leave the house and tends to be infront of the computer most of the time. Even when he is out, he tends to grab around.
While he did tried several methods to lose weight, it was all shortlived (perhaps at most 2 weeks). He ordered some meal plans but after a while he felt that the meals were too boring as he tried almost everything. Therefore he gave up after a while. He also tried fasting but he does not stick to it; maybe managed to do so for 3 days.
He also order food delivery everyday instead of going out to get food. Usually these platforms has a min spending. So he would have to order more than what he needed. He has a habit of drinking at least one sweet drink per day m. When I tried to restrict this to once every 2 days, it was tough. Could only try to encourage him to do so when we meet, which are weekends.
He also has the habit of sleeping late at night, like 3/4/5 a.m. Sometimes I would try to get him to do some exercise or even sleep earlier but he felt that I am controlling and naggy. I work in the healthcare sector and I witnessed how disastrous chronic illnesses could be. Stroke, heart attacks and amputation are some of the very common consequences. Many of the patients also told me that they regretted not taking care of their health better. I tried to get him to have a health screening check-up in hope that the health result may be able to motivate him to do something about his lifestyle but he has been postponing it for a year.
He does not see all these as much of an issue. Not sure how to encourage or help him with this without getting into argument or him thinking that I am naggy.

60379,106670,"Dating is so hard fr. Kind of want to give up some days.
Firstly it’s so hard to meet new people. My social circle is mostly attached people so they don’t have friends that they can introduce to me. (I’ve reached out and tried)
Second, ghosting is so common nowadays. I’ve never been ghosted until late last year and the feeling really sucks. Especially after you meet the person in real life. And it’s not really a stranger cos you have been texting for 2 months before meeting.
Third, I’m too picky. I have a specific type and that’s people who wear spectacles who are cute. That narrows my options significantly. I’m constantly trying to broaden my search but I’m afraid I won’t be as into them as they are to me.
Lastly, I’ve never been in a rs despite being mid-20s. Have been busy life and didn’t think about getting attached. And the only person that says I’m handsome is my mum, my sis said I was ugly. But I already knew that bro

60380,106672,"Hi all, sorry for adding on to the recent posts on jobs, but I really want to ask something.
I just grad from nus cs, but gpa is really bad, 3.4/5, and searching for jobs now. A few of the applications asked for gpa, which I feel that it is no pt applying to them since my gpa will automatically filter me out.
Should I still apply or just give up every application that asks for gpa, really demoralising for me. I do have a relevant internship, but it's just 1, and although it is an MNC, not those top companies like Google, Amazon etc. The skills required fits my profile, but I feel sad that my application will most likely be thrown away cos of my gpa, without a chance for interviews. There are so many applicants and alot of them must be fch right, how to compete.
What shld I do? Shld I just try to apply and give myself a false chance at hope?
Thanks so much. I'm feeling kind of down atm.

60456,106812,"To #106787 and those who got their A-level results recently: I agree with Prof Leong. I chose what I loved and studied math. It wasn't even my strongest subject. But it made me more money than the 99.999th percentile of software engineers and I now have enough to lounge around, write these long rants for the rest of my life, and gloat.
I didn't collect my A-levels cert on results day, so I found out my grades a week later. Just didn't like queuing and comparing grades. I was already admitted to the school I wanted, and the admission criteria for physics and math at NUS/NTU were low enough I knew I had my backstops. Turns out I was far from a perfect A-level score.
Admissions advice (somewhat CS-specific):
1. There’s wisdom in ignoring the current market outlook for choosing your career path. The market is extremely efficient, so if a particular major pays well now, you can be assured that it will be competitive and commoditized 4-6 years from now, arbitraging away whatever easy upside you get from picking that major.
2. This negative autocorrelation is already evident now with the tech layoffs - I know many in PE, PWM, consulting, marketing, sales, real estate, design etc. roles who’ve made more than their CS counterparts, with less effort.
3. There’s no free lunch. If it were really that easy to predict which sector would outperform others, you’d make even more money just leveraging your education funds in the stock market than studying in that field. Hypothetically, if you really would’ve had such a positive outlook on tech jobs 10 years ago, you’d have been richer just going all-in on FAANG stocks back then than getting a CS degree. And if you still feel your friends in CS really have better job prospects than you, it's never late to just buy into a tech sector ETF.
4. You don’t need a CS degree to be a practitioner. Incidentally, most of the best software engineers I’ve worked with have other STEM degrees or even no degree. 7th employee at Citadel - physics PhD, code still runs today, and he has more money than Jeff Dean.
5. Point 4 and ""do what you love"" translates into something I train all of my hiring managers to look out for. Which is that a software engineer who did in applied math at a top 30 school is most often stronger than a software engineer who did Course 6 at MIT.
6. Most global optimization problems are intractable, and only some highly-constrained optimization problems are easy. Applying this principle: it's bad to be ""interested in tech"". (I wrote #104647 on this.) Find a narrower interest than that. Even “interested in frontend” is not enough. There’s flavors of frontend: do you like frontend tooling and build, or frontend visual design, or building product flows, or maintaining component libraries? The sooner you can apply constraints in your career, the easier your (wealth) optimization problem. It’s hard to get rich by becoming among the top 100 frontend engineers in the world; it’s easier to get rich by becoming among the top 100 component library guys in the world.
7. I’ve seen many people falsely equivocate “Do what you love"" with being lazy. Truly doing what you love takes more hard work, grit, and determination than working for straight A’s to get into CS, law, or whatever course du jour. Traveling the world is not doing what you love. Writing a book; decorating homes; taking selfies; singing aren't. Doing what you love means getting so good at what you're passionate in that you've become one of the best in the world at it. It happens that I know people doing each of the above who've made 1-2 orders of magnitude more than the average L6 software engineer at Google. My best friend made more money modeling in her 20s than any L7 SWE I know, because she's good at it.
8. Taking a scholarship makes it hard for you to choose what you love. So be cautious. (And please don't be the guy with rich parents who breaks his bond after getting to Oxford, because you're depriving someone else.)
9. Pursuing what you love has ancillary benefits. Chiefly, it makes it easier to make quality friends in your adult life. It's nearly as hard making friends when I had $100 as when I had $100M.
I had lunch with the late Martin Trust shortly before he passed. If you have any clothes from H&M or Uniqlo made in Sri Lanka or Vietnam, you owe it to him. He said one thing that day that stuck with me today, ""I made my wealth selling underwear, so nothing's beneath me."" The man's short, but he stood tall. I heard he was surrounded with family and friends at the end.
Do what you love, and whatever you choose, don't fret if it's beneath your station. Because you'll have so many more ways to find happiness if you do.

60432,106772,"TL;DR I am in my first job after close to 3.5 years and I wanted to quit badly. I need to know how do I resign without appearing confrontational.
Working in a tech sector and as a regulator is probably one of the best places to be in right now. However, I felt that my ties with my supervisor is getting from bad to worse. It's either a case which she doesn't understand what I said, or to simply micromanaged me, which I think it's a blatant act of mistrust in me.
Just today, I said something and she gaslighted me by rolling her eyes.
The workplace is good, offering lots of skills upgrading and I guess that's the reason why I persisted on. However, I don't see myself staying there for long. I am probably just got to endure through this tech recession while using the company's resources to upskill myself. To be honest, skills are something people will never be able to take away from you.
I intend to apply for an internal transfer or to simply leave the public sector for a job, even if I have to settle for a pay cut than to have my lifespan cut short.
I am wondering if is it a must to speak to my supervisor before I tender my resignation? Or do I just simply submit a resignation to HR and just inform her after I am done? And how do I do it without being confrontational?
Thoughts?

It's not like they need me to give them allowance, they have sufficient savings and hv good jobs.
They just keep comparing me to my sister who grad same time as me but alrdy got a job. Well, sorry for not starting the job hunt early, since I was hospitalized and still struggling w some physical health conditions since last year. At that time, I was not even thinking of finding a job, I was thinking to take my life, I was in pain. Seems like they forgot and just blame me for being stupid and not starting the job hunt last yr, while I was sick.
And even though now I'm feeling better, I'm still on strong medicines until god knows when I can stop treatment. I really want to take a short break and alrdy starting to apply to jobs last mth. Seems like they expect me to find a job within 1 mth, in this economy. And everytime they keep telling me to just work, friend got 2k job at changi go work, pls we live at west side, and I got no human rights to take a rest???
I really just want to cry, but I got nobody to talk to. It's not like I'm asking them for money, I have been paying my own medical bills (around 500 a mth), hospital bills and everything, in case someone wants to lecture me about leeching off them. I have been taking the time to brush up my skills while waiting for interviews, and hv been constantly applying.
Rest also cannot, job apply alrdy nvr get back to me yet, since only few weeks, also unhappy. Really dk what to do, they want me to unalive myself before they get happy and stop stressing me out???

Throwback to two years ago, 23 years old, I never had a boyfriend. I am that kind of girl with pimples and oily skin. I deemed myself to be single.
Throwback to one year ago, 24 years old, I had my first boyfriend. A boyfriend who loves you for who you are, when he tells you you look better without makeup. A boyfriend who accompanies you ups and downs. However, as a ladies man, he was talking to other girls too. I was unable to accept it and the relationship fell apart.
Currently, I am in a loving relationship with my fiance. He is everything I wanted, smart, caring, generous and kind. Most importantly, treats you well, protects you and encourages you. What I want to say is don't lose hope. A failed relationship does not mean that you are doomed. Be at your very best, be yourself and you will attract the right one. No mind games, no forced convo, and everything just flows.
