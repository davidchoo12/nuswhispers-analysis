61231,108667,"I'm a full time working mum with  good prospect, earning more than my husband. My husband is a Grab Driver. However he rarely drive because he always claimed tired despite he no full time job and he never help in household chores. Everyday after work, once reach home, I started to do all the household chores myself. He never helps. From vacuum, mop floor to laundry & etc, he never help once since 9 years ago we moved into our new bto. I paid all the household expenses, I do all the household chores and I revise & guide my 2 kids for their homework everyday. I take care every single things for the family, without the help of my husband. 
I felt very upset and I started to develop bad temper. He knows I'm angry but he still never offer to help. Yet he told the kids I'm angery and get crazy for nothing. I feel utterly upset. Imagine he is in my role, I think he will get crazy long ago. He can't even offer to help anything. And he knows I got very serious scoliosis.  
He found that I always bad temper and always said something sacarstic towards me. If I'm working full time and pay for all the single household expenses, he shares the household chores, I'm really happy with it. But he never even offer to pay any household expenses, despite I told him everything price rise. If you were me, will you in good mood?
I felt exhausted ann I'm cryinf everyday. I feel hopeless...

61230,108661,"I've seen numerous articles on allowance to parents. This time, it landed on me. My apologies on the long story ahead. I needed to get it off my chest for my sanity...
My mother keeps comparing me to her friends children. “People earn how much also give their mother 40-50%” She goes around sharing with her friends that I’m only giving her so little allowance as compared to her friends children and that I should be giving her more. When I first graduated, she asked about my pay. I'm unwillingly to disclose much because of her behavior. She will calculate market rate, % and her friends children. She even asked, so when will you get promoted? (So that they will increase your pay). 
Fast forward, 2 years + later, I left my job. The intensity adds on. This was what hurts me enough that it was almost the last straw. She insisted that I continue to give her monthly allowance even though I'm jobless. She quoted: ""It's a principle thing"" + ""Where got you take up a loan, you can skip paying for x months?"" Someone suggested to return her the monthly allowances in instalments after I found a new job. FYI, I don't owe her any $$$. But this don't makes any sense to me no matter how hard I try to rationalize. Also, she’s a housewife, my father gives her more than enough. 
In my own opinion and capability. I’m giving out the amount I feel I can handle after taking into considerations of the future expenses (House, Renovation, Furnitures, Kids, Needs & Wants) etc. The only thing is I still live with her. Her house, her rules but not till this extent. I am self sustainable in terms of my needs & wants since I was 17. I don't get any allowances when I went to poly and uni while my siblings did. I did not ask for much. Then she began to add on “So fast think of house already?” I mean you don’t have to be at a certain age to think of the future expenses. What more, Singapore. Reality. 
Folks be like it’s your mother, she went through hardships to give birth to you etc. This shouldn’t be normalized. I deserved to be respected and treated as a human not a ….. :) Sigh, I’m tired really. I’m not giving her anything more than I can handle. I’m not giving in anymore. What's supposed to feel like a safe haven to me, no longer is.

61233,108694,"I am in a rather tricky situation, and would appreciate useful advice
I have just started work (3 months ago) at this Company. During the interview, I told my interviewer (who is the head of my department), that I am taking a part-time course, lessons are twice a week after work hours. My office is located at a far end of the island, and it takes about two hours to travel to this IHL.
During the first semester, he did not have any problems in letting me go off slightly earlier so as to be on time for class. However, during this current semester, when I emailed to inform him, he replied with a question how I plan to compensate the company back for my earlier release, which totalled, only 2.5 hours / week. 
Abit of a background, my current company is the extremely stingy-type. Not only do they not spend any money on staff training, they do not even provide us with a laptop to work at the construction site. While at site, often, we need a laptop to be able to sync with the server. My head of department, who is disrespectful, dismissive, condescending, and antagonistic, said we need to write in with justifications as to why we need a laptop as already, the company provides a desktop for each of us. The only person who has a laptop in our department is the head of the department, and he is the one who does not need a laptop as he does not travel out to site. So, two of my colleagues spoilt the market by using their own laptop for work, instead of writing in to justify for a laptop (I suppose it is because they know the likely outcome). By using their own laptops for work at site, they run the risk of damage or loss through theft. A construction site is a very dusty environment, which can affect a laptop very negatively.
As it is, I am paying out of my own pocket for my night classes, which is related to my work nature. I do not plan to stay on long in this type of company which has little prospects, and with this type of boss. 
The thing I wish to ask for your advice, is how to deal with the compensation for earlier release.

61229,108658,"Hi all, I'm a Business Analytics graduate from School of Computing. I have been in the workforce for a few years, and recently I was wondering if I should pause and take a full-time Masters in Computer Science. I'm interested to do a research masters (instead of coursework). However, I'm hoping to finance this masters through the NUS Research Scholarship. I was wondering how competitive is the scholarship award for Masters Research in Computer Science, specifically AI track? I had good grades when I did my Bachelors, but withdrew from my FYP previously because it was open-ended and the idea that I proposed didn't suit me and the Prof at the time. I was hoping to join an existing research project and learn from it instead. What are my chances of getting the research scholarship?

61228,108654,"I refer to the post #108648. I thank that guy for introducing the statistics from ministry of manpower on salaries. At least now I got something to refer to. I am from electrical engineering and the median for my industry is about 5207 (including employer CPF) which is very close to the 5197(including employer CPF) median of the overall gross monthly income. If I ask for 4.5K(excluding employer CPF) as my starting pay, does anyone think the companies will be willing to pay me median salary for a start? I have a degree in EE, Is it too much? (5.2K is including employer CPF, $4444 is excluding employer CPF so I round off to $4.5K) I think that as a degree holder fresh grad, I should ask for at least around median salary.

61232,108677,"I am horrified at many critical whispers on the embedded engineering career in the last months.
I have been offered an embedded position that is due to start after my final exams are over. I was told I will be working primarily on firmware with an occasional board layout design if required. The pay is at the median for an EE fresh grad.
Can I have an candid assessment on the prospects of this line of work? 
I hope people who have actual industry experience in embedded or engineering line can contribute their honest feedback.

I have been offered a Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics at NUS, but I am also considering applying for the Online Master's in Analytics at Georgia Tech.

Please note that the master's programs will be self-funded, with the NUS course costing over 50k and the Georgia Tech course costing over 15k.
