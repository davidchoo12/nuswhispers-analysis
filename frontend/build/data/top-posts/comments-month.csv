60259,106402,"I feel depressed because I was rejected by a girl on a personal level, most likely due to my financial background.
So I’m a guy, fresh into uni and new to relationships. Last semester I somehow get the courage to ask out this girl in the same year as me. Long story short, we hit off very well. We met up 5 times over a month, most times for an activity and not just a meal. On the 6th meeting, I sense the vibe is strong and I confess my feelings for her.
Up to this point I’m 100% confident she likes me back. But then to my utter surprise and horror, she says, “let’s just be friends, I’m not really into dating.”
I’m taken aback and I ask her why. She is surprisingly amiable and she takes some time to explain that it’s nothing to do with me but her, that she’s ‘just not into dating’ and doesn’t feel the need to get into a relationship. She also claimed that she honestly thought all those outings were just as friends and she didn’t know they were intended to be dates and apologised if she sent the wrong signals.
Regarding the “I just don’t want to date” line, I’ve heard countless times before that such rejections are actually personal. On NUSWhispers and also among my friends, there’s this saying: When a girl says she doesn’t want to date at all, she’s just trying to let you down easy, but actually she just doesn’t want to date YOU personally.
It's basically common knowledge.
Knowing the rejection was personal was so depressing. I suffered a mental breakdown over the next few days. It hurt like hell and got me agonising over what part of me is so bad. Some part of me must be so repulsive that I would get rejected on a personal level, especially with that cliché excuse of “I’m just not looking to date”. This excuse that covered up an unknown reason pained me to know that I had some personal problem that was so severe the girl must have deemed too hurtful to say out.
I agonised over why she didn’t like me. I narrowed it down to the 3 main common reasons: looks, education level, or financial status.
Now I know there could be other reasons, such as not feeling a romantic connection, incompatibility or mismatched personalities, which are completely possible and valid reasons for rejection, but I don’t think that’s the case here, otherwise the girl could have just told me she felt we didn’t click / were not compatible / I'm not her type; and such reasons are good and not hurtful at all. Furthermore we went out so frequently. Since she used the “just not into dating at all” excuse, she’s most likely lying to hide a deeper reason, and is trying to be nice because the real reason could be too hurtful for me to bear. So I think the reason is unlikely to be incompatibility or mismatched personalities, not least also because we shared a lot of similar hobbies like painting, music, etc. to name a few.
So such a hurtful reason has to be either looks, education level or financial status (I can’t think of any other reason too hurtful to say out).
I agonised for weeks after that, wondering what was wrong with me. It sure as hell cannot be education level as we were in the same year and taking the exact same course, down to the same minor. We both said we were aiming to continue doing a masters after our degree. As for looks... it’s very unlikely to be my looks as we went out multiple times. Also my friends all agree she was within my league in the looks department. And she was shorter than me.
So, that just left financial status.
As full time students who are not earning a steady income of our own yet, I once thought financial background didn’t matter much as long as I was still decently dressed and able to pay for dates. After all, we were in the same course, and it should be our future prospects that mattered more, right? Apparently, not in this case. I got the feeling she’s from a richer background than me and she probably realised it too. Because through our conversations, I found out she attended an expensive private high school, lives in the central area of a major city (she is a foreign student btw), and travelled to more Western countries than me. Doesn’t take a genius to figure out who is from a more well-off background. To clarify, I’m definitely not poor, I’m middle class. I don’t have student loans and both my parents work decent white collar jobs, but my background is definitely not as wealthy as hers.
And I’m pretty sure she knows I’m middle class because she asked what my parents were working as, and also asked what countries I’ve been to. And yes, I also paid for some of the ‘dates’ at decent eateries. But perhaps her financial standards were just too high.
Now I’m not saying that girls are gold diggers, but I heard that even in todays day and age, well-off women with their own money still want to date guys of equal or higher financial background compared to them, not because they are gold diggers and want the guy’s money, but simply because a higher financial status makes one look more successful and attractive overall.
So yeah, the girl most likely lied that she’s just not into dating to hide the hurtful truth of what she truly felt, that she thought my financial status was too low for her. Furthermore she is a foreign student from a country whose citizens have a reputation for being highly materialistic and judging others based on financial background. Deride me all you want for stereotyping or generalising, but like I mentioned earlier, rejection based on financial background seems most plausible. Furthermore, I have friends from that particular country who always specified that whenever girls from their country say “its not personal, I just don’t want to date in general”, the rejection is in fact personal and the other party is bullshitting.
So yeah, it has to be financial status. The only reason that is both personal and too hurtful to say out. Either that or there’s something else so repulsive about me that I’m hit with that cliche excuse.
And now I'm hurt like shit. Especially because of that girl's excuse.
Even if you don't agree with my assessment on it having been due to financial background, you can't deny that the rejection was personal towards me, and some part of me must have been so repulsive to the point she would use that 'not into dating at all' excuse. Either way, the rejection sure was personal. And the reason hurtful and terrible enough for the girl to use that cliche excuse.
So this happened months ago, but I still feel pained by it. Sucks to be rejected on a personal level, and judged for your financial background. My self esteem has been shattered and I am depressed. Trying to get this off my chest before the next semester…

I would probably rate myself higher then him as I am Smart (I am a scholar) ,I come from a well to do family eg (we can afford to go on at least one holiday per year)
Looks Wise I think I am okay, I get loads of looks and many guys have confessed to me...
However this guy is different especially religion wise.
The odd thing is this guy I feel can do way better than me, he is always thinking 10 steps ahead and he always talks about how to help others or come out with solutions to help people and businesses
He's doing okay academically, he plans for a masters too ,and this makes me happy
However my parents think that he's not smart because his from SIM and they harbor many stereotypes, eg he will drink a lot ,when in fact he doesn't.
and they think he would cheat on me , funny when my mum already suspects my dad has cheated on her
How do convince them otherwise???

60318,106546,"My dad is a wildly successful business owner with a tech recruitment agency with operations in New York City and San Francisco, and a net worth in the tens of millions. We live in a bungalow in Bukit Timah. He always told me and my older brother that we should never aim to be a corporate slaves because if one were to commit to working hard for anyone, it should only be for ourselves. I have been told this multiple times for nearly 30 years of my life. He is also of the opinion that people who strive to do very well in school and for their company, will rarely create life-changing wealth, because they are too socialized to doing well for others.
I have done well in school. I went to the best IP school and I graduated FCH from law school. Near the top of my cohort. I then got a masters from Cambridge, where I was also near the top of my cohort. Now that I’ve gotten a big four law job, I feel that my life is comfortable, I make good money, my bosses love me, and I feel no incentive to make it on my own. I was even told in passing that if I keep up my work I could make partner one day.
On the other hand, my older brother is a bioengineer, didn’t do that well for A-levels, graduated from the University of Michigan and then UC Davis, quit his pharma job to start an agricultural technology company in California with four of his friends from college that recently fund raised at an 8-figure valuation. Recently there was even an acquisition attempt that was rejected. Needless to say my dad has started to overwhelmingly favor him over me. He went to the same IP school as I did he was just very lazy about schoolwork.
I have a weird upbringing in that I used to bring home great grades from school and my dad was never impressed. My brother is a tinkerer and he built a PC at the age of 14 and back then my dad couldn’t stop bragging to relatives about it. At 16 he wrote a password manager on iOS that made a few thousand dollars in its first year and I literally have not seen my dad so proud about anything that I’ve ever done before. Not even when I was in the Humanities Programme and ranked 3rd on a literature block test in my JC cohort of 1000 people.
One thing he has never done is gave me explicit instructions to do anything. He has always believed in giving us a lot of freedom to try things and to fail. What affects me deeply is his unwillingness to show any regard towards those who are not inclined to challenge conventional life goals. I once overheard a conversation between him and my mom in the bedroom after he showed absolutely no reaction when I ranked first in my sec 2 class. He told my mom, “all he did was work very hard studying to do well on an exam, what’s so special about that?” That hurt me deeply. He has this deep distaste for what he believes to be a “typical Singaporean philosophy”—do well in school, get a good job, promote, make some money, retire. Which I frankly don’t know where he got it from since he also went to Raffles College, and he also has a degree from Cambridge.
I respect him greatly and I just wish to get some approval from him. I’m just not an enterprising person by nature. I find it odd that someone would look down on people who do well academically and aim to do well at their jobs. If my brother’s startup hadn’t been an immediate success he would have been working for no pay and no reward for 5 years. The amount of money I saved in the past 3 years alone gets me 80% of the way to making a downpayment on my first apartment. There was no risk involved. If I keep being on this trajectory I’d have more money than I know what to do with anyway. I honestly don’t need anymore than $5 million to retire comfortably.
I don’t hate my brother. I’m incredibly proud of him even though I used to not be able to stand it when his exam was literally 24 hours away and he’d be twiddling his pen in the living room watching anime. It always seemed to me that he was squandering his talent since I know him to be very intelligent. He learns things ridiculously quickly. Nevertheless I think the world values all sorts of people and I am incredibly happy that he has the creative energy that startup founders often share. I just don’t understand why my dad values people like him and not people who can really take an instruction and deliver the best work.

60290,106484,"Do you have friends that like just suddenly have an exponential growth stage out of nowhere?
This guy I knew in sec school was the definition of stupid and lazy, didn't do homework, didn't do any studying, pulled his own weight in projects but that was it. Ended up not doing so well for O levels for my school's standards, and went to some obscure neighborhood JC. He was one of those people you either loved or hated and basically that was the class verdict on him, half of them liked him and half of us didn't at all.
So like obviously I don't think about him the next few years because I'm also in JC and then army and then Uni, so like I heard about him during army from a couple of my friends and it seemed that he didn't do well enough to make it into local uni. And yeah that was it for a long time.
Then today I meet a junior who tells me that his (my junior's) classmate is in the same... idk lab group? (sry marketing major, don't understand science organization) as this friend of mine. And apparently he graduated (somehow) from NUS with a FCH.
Is that even fair? How did he even get in? You all know how hard it is to get As in uni and this guy can get As reliably? If he was in marketing or arts or something that wasn't obviously so science I'd question it less but this is like... engineering and sciences. He wasn't even good at science and didn't even pass math.
He's not even from a branded JC leh, and you see all these branded JC kids finding it hard to get FCH then this guy casually can't even make it in JC and secondary but all of a sudden FCH. I don't get it lol it's not like he worked hard during uni.

60264,106415,"I’m a guy who was led on by a girl… mildly infuriating.
Firstly, my story.
So one day in class I saw this girl I liked and asked her out to lunch. She said yes. We had lunch at a nice restaurant in a shopping mall, where I paid. From then on, we got along very well, we frequently met up, and chatted very well, all over the period of a month. By ‘well’, I mean ALL our meet-ups were one-to-one, we took turns treating each other to lunches, and we texted each other for hours on end, sometimes late into the night.
I was interested in her, and I also thought she was interested in me.
Then one fine day I confess my feelings for her. She looks genuinely shocked (and I’m shocked at her reaction too), then she says “I’m sorry, I already have a boyfriend, I thought we were just friends…”
By the way we have a mutual friend whom I’ve known for some time. But I only met the girl a month ago, so she wasn’t my friend prior to me asking her out. It was pure coincidence that my friend happened to know the girl quite well.
Later I found out from this friend that she already had a bf LONG before she met me, and she only saw me as a good friend from the very start. This friend also told me that she felt bad if she gave me the wrong impressions and was truly just trying to make new friends in the course, and wasn’t some stupid reason like trying to make her bf jealous.
The mutual friend is someone I know for some time and trust. So, if she truly is a nice person and wasn’t trying to make her bf jealous or what, I think she led me on because she was either lonely or something.
Now, my rant.
This has left me feeling kinda infuriated. I feel like I’ve wasted emotions. I invested some degree of emotions into this only to get heartbroken. Like, girls, ASSUMING you aren’t doing morally questionable things like gold-digging or making your bf jealous, you don’t agree to lunch at a RESTAURANT, with a NEW guy one-to-one, AND let him pay, AND to top it all off CONTINUE to meet up with him in a similar fashion, UNLESS you are interested in him as more than a friend, right? It’s just not normal! If you were interested in a new guy at first but later lost interest, then fair enough, but this girl already had a bf and wasn’t interested as more than a friend from the start. So it was really unfair for her to agree to go out one-to-one with me more than once, when she was never interested, as that would give me the wrong idea that she’s interested when she never was.
Sharing this partly as an appeal for all not to lead others on. It’s just not right.

60296,106497,"I was just 17 years old when my life fell apart. It all started with my first boyfriend. He was my age, and we had been dating for a few months. I thought he was the one, but I was wrong. He got me pregnant twice and I had to get abortions both times. It was a difficult and painful experience, but I thought it was all worth it for love.
My second boyfriend was 9 years older than me. I thought he would be more mature and responsible, but he ended up being just as bad as my first boyfriend. He was controlling and manipulative, and I couldn't get away from him fast enough.
My third boyfriend was only 5 years older than me, but he was the worst of them all. He played me like a fool and left me feeling used and worthless.
I was so focused on my relationships that I neglected everything else in my life. I used to vape and smoke a lot, and it affected my studies. I did very badly for my O levels, only getting 39 points. It was a far cry from the 213 points I got for my PSLE. I was in Secondary 5 when I took my O levels, and everything went downhill from there.
I was a Chinese girl and I thought I was fairly good-looking, but it didn't seem to matter. I thought that love would be the answer to everything, but it only brought me pain and misery. I couldn't help but feel like my life was ruined. I felt like I had nothing left to live for.
I used to be such a hopeful and optimistic person, but after all that had happened to me, I couldn't see the point in anything anymore. I felt like I was just a shell of my former self, and I didn't know how to move on.
I couldn't help but blame myself for everything that had happened. I thought maybe if I had made different choices, things would have turned out differently. But it was too late for that now. I was stuck in a cycle of regret and self-loathing, and I didn't know how to break free from it.
I wish I had known then what I know now. I wish I had realized that love isn't always enough, and that you have to take care of yourself first and foremost. But it's too late for me now, and I'm left to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.

60246,106371,"For the ladies out there who have never been in a relationship or dating before, as a female myself (25 yo, NUS alumni), I want to share on some important notes before you start dating or a relationship.
1) Actions from guys are more important than words. Yes, a guy may claim he miss you, text you good morning, say will bring you you to xxx, say will do xxx. If they are just saying without any actions done CONSISTENTLY, then it is just plainly talking.
2) Please don’t accept a relationship just because you are afraid to be alone or already in the so called “typical age range to get married” or most of your friends are attached. Rather to be alone than to be in a relationship/marriage suffering!!
Side track: according to book I read, the most important things in life for a lady are:
A) Health
B) Own savings
C) Family and Females Besties (see guy is not in the list)
3) Watch out for his body language. If a guy CONSISTENTLY:
A) Keep his phone/phone screen away from you
B) Disallow you from using his phone
Explanation for A and B: he does that because he has something fishy to hide.
C) Never want to put your couple picture as his dp or post on social media or even discourage you to do so. Delete your couple photos on his phone.
Explanation for C: He considers himself to be in the “bachelor” market. Means he is still looking around for his partner or even scared of people seeing you two together.
D) Always talk about himself and rarely entertain you
Explanation for D: One sided. He only want companionship. There should be give and take.
E) Always online on WhatsApp/Telegram but take 10000 years to reply your messages
No need to explain you should know why.
F) Say “none of your business”.
This is a major red flag. In a relationship, you all are supposed to work and listen together, not one don’t care about the other.
G) Don’t know what he wants in a relationship. Even after months.
H) Flirting and Cheating. When someone flirted and cheated although he has you, it means that your relationship is not that strong enough to begin and typically he will not suddenly change his heart overnight. So please do yourself a favour to distance away from him. Why tolerate someone like that?
I) Always texting a lot of female friends. Go to female friends’ house alone and not with a group of people.
J) Not willing to fork out money for meals/trips on YOU. If a guy is cash stripped because of his family situation (eg. Take care of family/pay loan/debt), it is understandable. Otherwise, the typical guy will always have more than money to spend on you on meals. Imagine a guy having difficulties parting with his money at the dating stage/while in a relationship, and imagine if you were to have kids with him, he definitely want you to spilt/pay for the hospital bills and baby accessories expenses. Would you ever want that?
Side note: a typical guy will chat with more than one girl online/in person. Please keep your eyes open and don’t put 100% heart into the relationship unless you feel reciprocated. Otherwise you will get hurt.
4) I suggest ladies to watch videos from Stephanspeaks YouTube Channel (yes I am a fan of him). From his channel, I learned that a guy who truly wants to be with you would put 100% effort and his heart to be with you. He will be willing to spend money and time with you. No excuses. No mind games. You will be his priority other than his job.
Thanks for reading up to here :). I have been in the above situations blindly until I woke up finally. It has been very heartbreaking for me since I put my 100% heart into it. I cried alot and felt depressed and I am recovering from it now. At least I am thankful for recognising it at the start of the relationship.

I graduated a year ago and have a full time job earning about 4k/mth. I've been working since uni to support myself and hardly asked my family for money.

It's not that I can't spare the cash since I'm quite frugal but I'm just tired of how they will remind/ chase me for the money if I'm late. I don't know what's their obsession with the money. When I bring up my financial situation, they will say they also don't have money and that I should just give. In the end, I'll just pay to avoid the arguments and drama. This is too exhausting.

60339,106592,"My mom cheated on my dad and they had a divorce during my O-Level year. I came home late one day because I was training for a race—I ran 100 and 200m—and a strange man walked out of her room. My dad was on an overseas business trip. I called my dad immediately and the divorce proceedings didn't take that long even when my mom was blaming my dad for being absent in the family because of work. My two siblings and I chose to move out of the apartment into a new apartment with my dad. My dad had one apartment which he conceded to my mom even though he paid every single penny for it.
It's been some years since I graduated with an FCH in applied math and I'm now in asset management and on a good income. For the past few months my mom kept trying to make contact with me to ask for money. She doesn't contact my brother and sister because they haven't spoken to her since the divorce. Since the divorce she dabbled in a few jobs and ultimately retired because she says she's too tired. She has a degree in accounting and she's was or is a CPA, I don't know how it works. She worked for PwC for several years before quitting to stay at home. She said she had to look after the kids when we had a domestic helper our whole childhoods and we were almost never home. I was in childcare until I was 7.
My dad dotes on us, pays for everything at home, and he alone paid for all three of our university tuitions, even for my brother, who went to medical school at the University of Sydney on no scholarship. My dad isn't that rich. He's been in risk-management at an insurance company his whole life. He just worked and worked and he loves us. Now that he's retired, he's finally had time to do things that he loves doing, which is to cook. So he decked out our kitchen with stainless steel commercial-grade kitchen equipment and he's just been making food. Last year on his 60th birthday, I bought him a custom French cooking suite, the kind that's used in fancy restaurants but smaller, I've never seen him so happy. I'm happy to see him being so happy.
I'm not on good talking terms with my mom although I still answer her calls. But she's never asked about my life, she's never asked about my dad, never asked about my siblings, all she does is complain about how hard her life is and how much money she has left. She has brought nothing but disaster to this family. She hurt us so much that my brother and I have zero interest now in being in any relationships and I doubt this will change. I really want this relationship I still have with my mom to end but I feel bad sometimes so I answer her calls.
Can someone please walk me through if I should learn to be more cold-hearted in this because every time I see her I see that man's face walking out of her room and my immediate desire then was I wanted to chuck something very heavy and very hard at his head, we had 4-foot vase in the living room then and I was already itching to do it but I held myself back.

60252,106385,"Depressing story time. You know how in school your teachers tell you that hard work is most important than intelligence? I used to believe that until I got into uni.
My PSLE 100+ almost went NT but got into NA stream. A lot of my classmates are typical pai kia, smoke in toilet, don’t go school and fake MC, have sex in school. I’m the more guai type, study hard, attend all my class but just shit at study. Maybe I stupid, idk, sometimes I see my other classmates sleep in class all day, never go school, never do homework but exam time results is same or better than me and it make me very angry, why I just cannot understand how to study?? My father kena fired that time, no money send me tuition but my teachers always offer help, give me extra tuition after school. My outside friends all also very help me, give me their school notes and past year exam papers. They all very smart, go atas school and express.
N level ok, O level not bad can go poly. At first want to challenge myself, purposely choose harder course. School alumni team even ask me go back talk to the NA NT tell them about my success into going poly.
Few months in results like shit again, lecturer also advice me maybe this course not my calling, not suited for my skills so change to easy course, close both eye also can pass that kind. Again study very hard, go to all my lecture always ask question and after school mug until last bus home then go home. Everyone told me I age a lot. My outside friends all also ask if I ok because I look like shit. No matter how hard I also pia because my family not rich, cannot afford change course then drop out, unlike my outside friends can go overseas do masters do this do that idw sound jealous but actually I quite jealous them.
Meet up with outside friends, all grad already, always talk about their work life, their job, marriage plan, BTO. I sit there like idiot because I 3 years behind everyone. They not purposely make me feel like shit, also give me a lot advice like do internship, do online course and build up CV all. Meanwhile I still over here studying like dog no time do internship or online course.
After mugging like shit for years, surprise surprise, average result. Fuck. 90% my course mate don’t even go lecture, always ask me and others help take attendance, but still results come back half of them better than me. Fuck. Really fuck, IQ 0 EQ also 0. Reaching 30 years old finally got 1 gf at 20+++ actually is I feel like I just anyhow settle for a gf because parents worried I gay or cannot get married so I shoot my shot with every girl. After that find out she also feel the same, just settle with me like I’m rebound because she just break up with her bf and want get back at him. We still in rs but sometimes feel like we just lonely together aiya that’s another story for another time.
Keep applying job, kena rejected by 99.999% company, only lanjiao insurance scammer give me call back. All the company tell me I no experience so cannot. Eventually bo bian settle for internship $800 a month while my outside friends working lawyer, doctor, banker all making 5-10 times more than me, probably even more.
How? Hard work? PUI! Hard work can put food on table? Can do well in school, get good job? Joke. I accepted already I just stupid. Think my big take away is the reason why is call “success story” because it almost never fucking happen.
Maybe make me better person? Can eat a lot of shit 吃苦大王 too bad in life king of eating shit get shit eating job and shit eating life.

60289,106483,"Cny is coming and honestly although it’s supposed to be a festival where families gather together it’s very dreadful for me.
As compared to my older brother who is more cheerful, smart, popular and handsome. I am the exact opposite (quiet and awkward). So I grew up with my aunties comparing both my brother and I , with many criticisms directed at me.. not as handsome, not as smart, why so short. As my patents always told me that it’s important to maintain harmony I always put up with all these criticisms.
Last year before cny bro and I both got attached and his gf is a model so she’s really good looking in society standard. My gf on the other hand is more of the normal looking in society standards (ofc to me in my heart she’s the best and prettiest). As we just started dating last year I did not bring her back for cny.. (she felt that it was too soon), my bro on the other hand brought his gf back and got many praises .. Woww gf pretty, rich etc
This year I plan to bring my gf back but overheard one of my relative telling my mother : “eh this year your small son bringing gf back.. how is she like? Prettier than bigger son gf? I want to compare leh..”
As I grew up being compared to my elder bro, I know the feeling of being compared .. it’s really very hurtful and I do not want my gf to be subjected to that treatment . I know my gf will be very hurt as well .. As such I’m wondering in order to protect her should I just not bring her to cny this year as well?
any advice?
I really hate those relatives during cny.. it’s a festival meant for everyone to gather not gossip.

i don't know if my gf has an anger mgmt issue, is schizo, bipolar or smthg else but wtv the case is, i just hope she can get better
normally she is super nice, very sweet, even thoughtful. but once in a while she transforms into someone i don't even recognize. i live in stress everyday for fear of her fiery temper and i have no idea when it will next strike.
she is also an avoidant. when she is angry she will disappear on me and even block me on social media with no warning. other times when she did not go so extreme she just goes on a few hours long screaming match at me while i can only listen.
the strange thing is she is normally a good person so it is not like she is like this everyday.
i love her a lot but it has already been two years and the situation has not improved. she is super touchy about the word mental health so it is impossible to suggest to her that smthg may not be quite right or she shld learn better habits. i have tried to talk to her about this when she is her normal self but she forgets all her promises the next time she gets pissed.
when she gets pissed she will also insult me and say a lot of things which are just not true. it is really hurtful and damaging. i am not sure if i should take these to heart and discuss the content of what she said each time? as they say no fire no smoke. roughly once a month she breaks up with me and we patch back again two days later all on her own accord.

60283,106462,"I grew up in a less than privileged background. I worked super hard, because my mother told me to. She told me that if I didnt work hard, she wouldn't pay for school. That it.
I slogged my ass off, raffles, then nus medicine. I just worked hard, listened to advice from my peers, and worked. I remember failing multiple times during this process, failing, and getting up, no tuition nothing. and before you think I am bragging, I am not, I am bitter. I am bitter because I had no help during those struggles, those struggles where I saw my friends going for tuition after their fun ccas so they could get someone to catch up with them, and then off for nice holidays after each tiring semester. meanwhile I went home to a crowded home with not much.
in university, my parents didnt even understand the course I was in. They said oh wow good ah doctor. But they didnt understand the stresses I was under, how my peers looked down on me for not being able to get that starbucks every week, or eat the same meal every day (""why you always eat the same thing lol"") no one said anything explicitly, but just people started hanging out with me less... and less.
Now I have a family, small but its mine. dont really have friends from school, just a few work ones who we get teh (coffee shop) together and its surprisingly the highlight of my week. I dont want to have kids because I dont want them to go through what I had gone through.
my mum, she was probably the driving force behind why i cant quit. I now acknowledge its my trying to live up to her expectations and make her proud that I did all of this. I never once dared to show her my failures, or my struggles, or my isolation. Because I was the son she was proud of, I was important in her eyes. and so I kept the path, never once considered seriously dropping out even though I had minimal interest in this medical path.
its 2am and I have just finished a shift. I hope that someone out there reads this and learns something from it. you wil inevitably be influenced by your parents/peers/society. this is something ive learnt that cannot be avoided. but what you can do is to be conscious of it, and to try bit by bit, to integrate a part of yourself in a sustainable way, a part of happiness in your life so that one day you can find peace in the struggle that is your job/career/course.
Have empathy for the peers who seem isolated and struggling, or even acted out in school. Dont write them off as introverts or whatever. They likely just have more to deal on their plates than you do, or you have more social/economic support than them to get through your shared circumstance. Maybe say hi, share notes, or reach out to them if you havent heard from them for a while and say hey, I see you, I know youre struggling, Im going through this with you (not in those exact words but like sometimes just company helps)
one last thing, I would also like to say thank you to that one senior in school who stood by me when things were tough and that it was very meaningful and prob was the reason for finishing the course.
I try to do that now with my juniors in the hospital. Anyway goodnight

60262,106407,"For the guys out there who have never been in a relationship or dating before, as a guy myself (25 yo, NUS alumni), I want to share on some important notes before you start dating or a relationship.
1) Actions from girls are more important than words. Yes, a girl may claim she misses you, text you good morning, say will bring you you to xxx, say will do xxx. If they are just saying without any actions done CONSISTENTLY, then it is just plainly talking.
2) Please don’t accept a relationship just because you are afraid to be alone or already in the so called “typical age range to get married” or most of your friends are attached. Rather to be alone than to be in a relationship/marriage suffering!!
Side track: according to book I read, the most important things in life for a guy are:
A) Health
B) Own savings
C) Family and Guy Besties (see girl is not in the list)
3) Watch out for her body language. If a girl CONSISTENTLY:
A) Keep her phone/phone screen away from you
B) Disallow you from using her phone
Explanation for A and B: she does that because she has something fishy to hide.
C) Never want to put your couple picture as her dp or post on social media or even discourage you to do so. Delete your couple photos on her phone.
Explanation for C: She considers herself to be in the “spinster” market. Means she is still looking around for her partner or even scared of people seeing you two together.
D) Always talk about herself and rarely entertain you
Explanation for D: One sided. She only want companionship. There should be give and take.
E) Always online on WhatsApp/Telegram but take 10000 years to reply your messages
No need to explain you should know why.
F) Say “none of your business”.
This is a major red flag. In a relationship, you all are supposed to work and listen together, not one don’t care about the other.
G) Don’t know what she wants in a relationship. Even after months.
H) Flirting and Cheating. When someone flirted and cheated although she has you, it means that your relationship is not that strong enough to begin and typically she will not suddenly change her heart overnight. So please do yourself a favour to distance away from her. Why tolerate someone like that?
I) Always texting a lot of male friends. Go to male friends’ house alone and not with a group of people.
J) Not willing to fork out money for meals/trips on YOU. If a girl is cash stripped because of her family situation (eg. Take care of family/pay loan/debt), it is understandable. Otherwise, the typical girl will always have more than money to spend on you on meals. Imagine a girl having difficulties parting with her money at the dating stage/while in a relationship, and imagine if you were to have kids with her, she definitely want you to spilt/pay for the hospital bills and baby accessories expenses. Would you ever want that?
Side note: a typical girl will chat with more than one guy online/in person. Please keep your eyes open and don’t put 100% heart into the relationship unless you feel reciprocated. Otherwise you will get hurt.
4) I suggest men to watch videos from Andrew Tate YouTube Channel (yes I am a fan of him). From his channel, I learned that a girl who truly wants to be with you would put 100% effort and her heart to be with you. She will be willing to spend money and time with you. No excuses. No mind games. You will be her priority other than her job.
Thanks for reading up to here :). I have been in the above situations blindly until I woke up finally. It has been very heartbreaking for me since I put my 100% heart into it. I cried a lot and felt depressed and I am recovering from it now. At least I am thankful for recognising it at the start of the relationship.
iykyk ;)

I have to do a submission in order to comment because my entire ""family"" is on my fb.
I have the same toxicity family as you. And mind you, giving money is the least of my worry. I still have to do entire household chores taking turns with my sister while my own dad is watching youtube and mom playing phone games.
When i was still under one roof with them it was nightmare every day. I had to bug my bf to hurry up marry me and get me out of there. I was very stupid for me to tell them my salary of 3.6k back then and i started buying them gifts. And the ball dropped on me when they wanted allowance of $500 because they saw how well to do I am. On top of that, i have to pay for my mom's shopping spree on lazada and taobao because ""i dont know how to do online payment"". I damn regretted teaching her and showing her the good deals available. It is really bad during the 11/11 whatever sales.
So here's the thing on how i escape from these sick ""parents"" who treated me as an investment.
I stayed more in my bf's house, saying that it was nearer to workplace. I eventually got married, got my bto, 2 kids. I told my parents that im not paying them anything other than cny angbao. I have my own life to handle, bills to pay myself and guess what i asked for money from them. They dodge me all the way.
I mean i heck care. They went to manipulate my relatives saying how useless am i. They even refuse to take care of my bb. Refuse to help in house reno. Whatever. I do it myself with my husband & his family. And i never regret this move ever since. Honestly its good riddance since they are out of my life and waiting for me to fail. But i show them success and happy without them.
To any boomers who are about to comment how unfilial am i, think again.
If my parents didnt demand harshly, i would have spent lavishly on them, bring them out on holidays, more family time spent. But they made the whole thing so sour, spoil my image to all the relatives and friends, refuse to help in my confinement, playing with my kids, i think this is what strike the balance. Force me until i simply dont care anymore.

People never learn from history. From the dot com bubble burst in 2000, life science hype during early 2000s, chemical engineering in the late 2000s, the cycle just keep repeating itself.

60276,106448,"How do you live with regret?
I met her when we were in school. I was in my final year while she's a freshman. It was love at first sight. I pursued her furiously and we got together a few months later. She was the entire package and my ideal type of girl. But a few months later I lost interest and left her after I graduate. I admit it was entirely my fault and I broke her heart. I thought our interests would no longer align and I believed I would move on to focus on my career. I started to play the field as I decided I'm not ready to settle down yet. I have to say, she was still the best out of the others that I've met.
Fast forward a few years later. I met her on a flight on one of my business trip. I thought fate brought us together. We went out of a meal while overseas as we have some free time before I start my work. I can feel sparks flying the entire evening and I believed she felt the same way too. Everything was smooth until I asked her if she's seeing anyone. My heart sank when she said she's attached.
Nonetheless, I wished her well and we continued to keep in touch even after I've returned to sg. I couldn't get her out of my mind. I was actually casually seeing someone else but I quit it after meeting my ex. My ex doesn't post much on SM so I couldn't guess who's her bf.
Even though years past, she's still the perfect girl in my eyes. I've never met anyone who can make me laugh as much. I felt very protective of her. Her charisma, confidence, I looked up to her as she's someone who's very knowledgeable, supportive and caring too. Not only that, we come from the same background plus we still have common interests. I believed we are perfect for each other. I still enjoyed hearing from her after all this time. Who can forget their school sweetheart that easily? We continued to text each other like friends. I never thought to confess as I didn't think it was appropriate as she's attached and I also believed I can be happy for her as long as she's happy.
Imagine how elated I was when she suddenly asked me out one day and said she had news. I thought she was going to tell me she broke up with her bf or confess to me. I thought it was going to be a date.
I still remember how beautiful she looked. We talked as though time never left us. Talking to her was so easy. I never had to worry about what to say next. When we finished our meal then she told me the news.
Her bf proposed. She's engaged. And this will be the last time we see or speak to each other. She confessed she wanted to meet and tell me instead of texting because she wanted to see me for the last time. She also said she needed to let me go and apologised for being friends again. I was devastated. Not only am I losing her forever, I can't even be in her life anymore. I didn't know how to convince her I'm fine but I guess she already knew.
Eventually I found out her bf was actually someone we both know from school. So I guess that guy went after her after we broke up.
I felt so stupid for letting her go. My feelings for her were stronger than before as I thought she is the one. Some nights I wish I can turn back the time and not break up with her. I know I'm no saint. I still do casual dating. I end up comparing my dates to my ex and this frustrates me.
Probably that's why my ex never chose me again as I may have given her the impression I'm not serious to settle down. Soon I realised I didn't want to settle down is because I only wanted to settle down with her.
Dear S,
I'm sorry for hurting you. I know I can never turn back the time. You've always been the one for me. A part of me will always love you. I deeply regret letting you go and I understand why you removed me from your life. You deserve the best. I wish you a blissful, happy and longlasting marriage with J. He is a lucky man to have your love and I hope he cherish you forever.

He was helping her to move out from the school hall to her new place. That took almost a whole day and he slept over at her new place. That happened a year back when we just got together. I trust that it was purely to help out a friend without family here in SG. His bestfriend got attached recently too to a local guy. Four of us would hang out once in a while, most recently to USS. It all seems normal when we are out. Yesterday he asked if he could invite her to his family reunion dinner this year.

One day before meeting up, we didn't text for a day and so I texted him in the evening to confirm if we are still meeting, he said yes and he's glad that I texted him instead cause he didn't want to double text me and look like a simp. How's that double texting when I responded to his goodnight but just so happen that the last text was by him? So yea after meeting up, I have never felt embarrassed to walk beside anyone before and I felt it, I cut it short by making an excuse that I need to go right after dinner. What actually makes me go was that he can say it to me that everyone thinks that he looks way better in person than his picture, but unless his 'everyone' is his mom, I wouldn't believe it. I thought I made it clear that I have to go urgently and I even said I wanted to go to the herbal tea shop alone, yet he still follows me. Guess what, after the dinner I didn't text him, and he triple text me, what happens to not wanting to be a simp or whatever it is about not wanting to double text someone?

I lied on my résumé that I’ve already graduated. And my employer did not ask to see my certificate. Straight to the point. Company manpower audit is coming this April, but I won’t be able to complete my course until May.
During the audit my company is known for contacting previous employers to verify if certain certificates are valid, and will also sometimes ask for WSQ cert printouts. And will even go to MOM or ITE or BCA etc… to check validity of safety or technical certificates of employees. So what do I do if they contact NUS and found out that I’ve yet to graduate. My employment contract did have 1 sentence that outlines that “all information are true and correct to the best of my knowledge”. Should I submit my 2 weeks notice? Hoping that since I’m not there they won’t audit me. Can they sue me for it? Also the job is paying pretty good, and I do see myself building a career here.

I met the girl who ltr became my gf while I was at an group event with my mom. As y'all can imagine (I think), we tend to act more conservatively with our parents around, that being said, we won't be speaking in the same kind of tone and language we usually does with our friends and peers, or even to pick up girls in front of our parents. I soon took a liking to her personality and rly wanted to at least make friends with her, but I just felt awkward to approach her in my mom's presence.
But my mom being a super sociable person, made friend with her, and often like to invite her over for a meal. And I took the chance to jio her out too. Soon we became friends whom hanged out often and then a couple, after I confessed.
But the problem is, im not sure how should I tell my mom about this.
The main pt I rly wanna convey is, in the event of a break-up, chances are we can't go back to being friends again and may cut contact, and I hope for my mom to respect that by stop inviting her over or better wise, not contact her too.
I rly dont wish to come across as being controlling of my mom's freedom to hang out with her, but I think anyone who has been through a peaceful but sad breakup understands the implication of this.

60319,106547,"A couple of months ago, I made a new friend via a group of mutual friends and saw this girl whom I thought was really pretty and has a good personality. She likes someone else from our group and they have been hanging out together exclusively, though they don’t consider themselves dating.
Whenever I meet this group of friends, I try not to interact too much with this girl directly as I’m afraid that I may grow to like her (because I already find her very attractive) but I’m already attached in a stable relationship.
We all met up today to gamble at one of our friend’s houses. During the initial mingling, somehow she ended up sitting next to me on the couch and she started talking to me, asking me about my vacation as I just returned from an overseas trip. I know this just seems like small talk but I thought it was still nice that she bothered to ask me some details of it.
Then when the group started playing blackjack, I had already sat down but she also ended up choosing a seat just next to me, even though it was not the only empty seat available. Throughout the entire session, she was seated quite closely to me; our arms touched at some points, she also crossed her legs in which they were sticking into my direction and body language wise, she was also seated in such a way that she was kinda facing my side profile.
To be honest, I know she doesn’t like me in any sort of special way but somehow, it still felt nice to be sorta sharing that close physical space with her for that 4 hours. I will not dare to dream of anything more nor take actions of any kind because I’m not the kind to cheat and I do love my gf. To others who know about this, they will probably just brush it off as an eyecandy but all my past exes started off as my eye candies whom I found attractive and we eventually got together.
I’m meeting this same group of friends tmr again and my gf will be coming along too. I think I’ll just maintain lesser direct interactions with her, but the fact that I’m having random thought of her is annoying me. Not seeking any advice here, just wanted to get this off my chest.

60345,106601,"as a young university graduate employee you may find yourself worried about retirement.
retirement is nothing to worry about. all Singapore citizens and PR have this amazing pension plan called the CPF life.
the trick to cpf hacking to meet ""enhanced retirement sum"" and ""basic healthcare sum"" is inaction.
yes simply do nothing to your MA and SA.
all you need to do is to earn a high income by age 30.
ie. get a minimum of 6K monthly pay and total bonus of 5mths additional wages. ie 102,000 of your income must attract CPF.
at this income, you will find yourself meeting basic healthcare sum easily. and the excess will be transferred to SA regularly. if you continue to attract 102,000 annual income, you will get enhanced retirement sum from just your SA alone, and from the automatic MA transfers to SA.
just use your OA liberally for housing, and enjoy your quality of life. because your (SA+MA) will be able to hit (ERS+BHS) at age 55 anyway. you will get an annuity of 5k per month at age 65.
TLDR: use the skills given by NUS to find a 6k/mth job with 5 months bonus per year & work for 30 years from age 25-55.

When she suggest to maintain the frequency we meet, I’m just doing it to make her happy. But I do find her clingy/sticky now. Cause she place me on high importance and made her life revolve around me.
In summary… I used to enjoy her presence. Now I felt that I’m just meeting her out of obligation. Maybe my heart isn’t fully into her nor wanting this rs anymore. She is a nice lady, and I really don’t want to hurt her. But breaking up with her for good is in my consideration.

60263,106408,"Uncertain plans for the future
Hi guys, I am a 24M in NUS psychology. As a guy who is rather soft and emotional due to experiencing much setbacks, dramas that are forced upon me, I am more of a person who prefers a slow pace of life. I believed being happy is the most important thing in life and while I do not need to be extremely rich, being poor is a no-no. However, I am easily swayed by what others say about my decision.
When I told some of my friends how I planned to move to Malaysia after working full time until I am 30 once I complete my studies in 2 years (considering I currently already have 100KSGD that I saved up over part time jobs ever since my O level days and investing in shares), they commented how unambitious I am.
Thus I am really uncertain. Is it wrong to want a simple, peaceful, slower pace of life? I worked part time and studied for close to 10 years just in hopes to reach my goal faster, while everyone just brush me off as incompetent.
TL:DR I know people in the comments will be commenting my current balance isn't enough to migrate to Malaysia , thus I mentioned migrating when I am 30. Which will be about 6 years of full time working after I finished my degree in 2 years time (I will be 24 by then). I think I can afford a car and terrace house in Malaysia by then?
My apologies for the lowkey flexing of my balance, as I am very proud of myself considering my parents did not contribute any $$$

For all the young adults who have similar type of parents. Your parents are adults too and have been adults far longer than us, if they don't contribute their fair share in the relationship emotionally, physically then it's time to cut them out. It's not our responsibility to make sure they can retire
It doesn't makes any sense that I work my ass off 9-5 + OT, contribute the fillial money($1.2k out of $4k), just to go home where my only interaction with my parents is being scolded for not doing enough chores when I have always done my fair share. Even worse is scolded by a fulltime housewife... who do a max 3hours of chores a day then slack off for the rest of the day finishing a TV series every two to three days. I even confronted them about their behavior but they wouldn't listen with the entitled snobbish attitudes. It was too ridiculous for me..so I left immediately when I got married and got my HDB and never paid or contacted them ever again.
So much happier now.

60327,106570,"Is it okay for a mother to enforce curfews on her sons when they’re grown up?
I am a 24M in university, and I still get called up at pre-midnight hours by my mother to get back home asap. I do like to enjoy my time with friends and s/o and that sometimes exceeds certain hours of the day. Usually the easiest solution is to ignore or appease, but the same issue keeps popping up over the years. It sucks when your friends and s/o overhear my conversations with my mum, and to know I as an adult still get given a curfew. As far as I know, my older sibling got the same treatment as well, and the way he handled it was by ignoring all the nagging and reprimanding.
I really dislike conflicting with my mother as it gets more tiresome (she can keep rambling on and on, sometimes leaving for 2-3min and coming back/calling on the phone multiple times after she thought about what else to nag about). She claims it’s because I have work/school/etc reasons and need to be alert throughout the day (which I’ve never demonstrated my incapability for).
Honestly the best solution was to stay in student housing, but that isn’t applicable all of the time (and won’t be after I graduate).
What should I do? Is this parenting gone too far, or am I just being a brat?

Students like us who haven't started working may possibly just lose this $27 if they fail to receive an accommodation offer, which is highly likely given the high demand and low supply, and this amount is certainly not small.
To put things into perspective, HDB only charge couples $10 when they apply for a BTO. May I know who allows UHMS to dictate the price of the application fee and is there anyone in NUS ensuring that this application fee doesn't get ridiculously high over the years? Thank you!

I teach him social interaction, empathy, identifying risks and problems, coming up with solutions, stamina, and perseverance and always have a backup plan.
I own and run a business with mid 8 figure revenue. I didn't graduated from the top schools for my undergrad degree. I make up for it taking up short courses at Ivy League schools. Even NUS, which turned out quite disappointing for the lacklustre quality of teaching staff.
And why I teach my son all these, and why I'm practising them. In running a business, we can always hire the Ivy Leagues to execute the business plans. But it takes more than the smart guys to run a business.
We need EQ to connect with people at a deep level, we need empathy to truly understand our customers and partners problems, we need out of the box thinking to come up with a solution as our customers and partners are staffed with the smart brains. We need gumption to ask stupid questions so that we can really dive deep and understand the issues. We need humility to talk to people.
So to everyone, think differently. Grades and pedigree are important, but to be the top 1%, it is way more than that.

60235,106353,"There is a bird called jiji. One day, while jiji was doing its morning hunt, it got shot down and lost its conscience. When jiji woke up, it found itself in a palace, closed in a golden cage with another bird called miamo.
Jiji then asked miamo how it landed there, and miamo said jiji was shot down and thereafter got locked up tgt. Jiji got panicked and asked miamo how to escape. Miamo told jiji 'there's no need to escape. If you stay here with me, I will share all the exquisite worms and offer you my fresh water, and we can be best buds. In fact, I asked the king to keep you in, he actually wanted to slaughter you cause he was craving bird meat, but he granted my request since I am his favorite pet.'
Jiji looked around the cage and the palace, and after putting in some thought, jiji decided to give it a shot. After spending some time with miamo, jiji fell in love.
One day, when miamo left for grooming, jiji overheard two guards' conversation that miamo was the one that requested the king to shoot jiji down because miamo had been lonely for a long time that Miamo had never seen a bird like jiji that is purple. The fur shines like a diamond, so miamo asks the king to bring jiji back. The guard also mentioned that once, miamo told the king, 'Yikes! After getting to know jiji, I found out that jiji has body odour! It reeks! And you know what? Jiji coat is not the glittery purple coat I imagined it to be! There is a black undercoat beneath the purple. I thought it was beautiful, turns out to be a fake! In fact, I saw another beautiful bird that is red, and I could have gotten that instead. What a waste!'
Once jiji heard that, jiji was beyond heartbroken. Jiji could no longer look into miamo eyes or speak to miamo. Jiji felt like its heart was torn into a million pieces.
Jiji knew this was no longer the place for it. One is raised in the palace that is used to the rules and lifestyle, while the other is a wild bird that enjoys freedom and carefreeness. Jiji then carefully curates its exit plan without anyone knowing. After planning and executing the perfect plan, jiji finally got out of the cage. Jiji flew and flew so far that it reached a place it had never found itself before.
Jiji was tired out and took a rest. Then all the emotions hit, and jiji finally let loose and let everything out. Jiji looked back at the time it spent with miamo and missed it a lot. But jiji knew they were different and feelings were not mutual. At one point, jiji thought maybe this was the lifestyle it could settle for, but once jiji knew the truth, it could never be where it was because everything just seemed so shady and shallow. Which of the moment was true? Jiji never knew and could never put in the same level of trust anymore.
A few years have passed since the incident, Miamo and jiji are both leading their separate lives. Miamo is still enjoying its exquisite worm and luxurious palace life, while Jiji goes for the usual morning hunt. They may no longer be together, but life has become quieter, more peaceful, and more secure.

- she can use fb and ig for hours without replying me
- she complains to her friends about me
- never apologetic even when she's in the wrong
I've been contemplating if I should just cut my losses and move on. I love her and it hurts but I feel like a part of her hasn't healed and she's causing damage to me. I've emotionally withdrawn myself from the rs (eg reply late, don't bother when she's angry) and I feel toxic.
What would you do in my position? Everytime I voice out something, she gets annoyed at me and then ghost me cos she's mad. I kind of have my answer but I just wanna see how others who have been through something similar would react.

Is this the new norm, red flag, or just a waste of time
Thanks!

60256,106395,"I was a scholar, did decently well, went on to management associate programme then completed my Masters. Wife is few years younger, attractive and I started dating her when she was an undergraduate. I'm few years older than my wife (hence more mature in life) and somewhat successful until early career. I'm also expected to have a higher earning potential than her.
My role has been nothing but supportive to her, and in her words, she won't be here if not for the guidance, advice and support for her.
I'm struggling now in my personal life and career. When Covid hit, we were badly hit. While she was able to pull through and managed to land a job in something like Big Tech (with awesome benefits package etc). She is also being valued at work, and is poised for promotion soon.
On the other hand, I feel like my life has been in a downward spiral. To name a few, I became obese (BMI 30) and past year attempts to lose weight haven't been successful. My career seemed to have become those do minimal at work and already plateau. How I ended up here is another story. Trying to find job has been unexpectedly bad. I don't know if I can blame the economic condition. I'm struggling to find motivation. Sometimes I just want to stay home and take care of our kid. The more I think about that, the more depressed I feel. I don't think I'm clinically depressed.
I love my wife very much, and I am proud of her success and at the same time jealous that she is going to live the career dream I want and I'm no where near. Jealous to the extent that I'm whining that she is so busy with work, and wants more attention. I am using the term 'jealous' instead of 'envious' because I feel that I may start to sabotage her career by guilting her to spending more time with family etc simply because I am spending more time at home.
At times, her company has functions that I have not participated as her spouse. I feel ashamed of where I am, and not worthy of the rising star in the company. She has many colleagues who are even more successful than her (earning a million every few years). I just don't see how I could fit in with them unless they are a bunch of housewives.
I know gender roles are pretty ingrained in me, and that's also the case for my extended family. I want to be supportive of her but the stark difference in our career is creating a huge imbalance in me. While I have been ""leading"", I have often thought I should just be the ""smaller"" person, and quietly supporting her. But I feel sad, that I am not even 10% of my full potential. We communicate very frankly and openly with each other. I shared these thoughts with her, and she just still believe that I can still ""make it"" and once I do, I would be in much better career than her. To be honest, I feel battered especially after the past few years and all I'm seeing is me being more and more left behind.

60316,106539,"Long story regarding my relationship, please bear with me as I’m looking to help couples that are going through this phase or eventually will go through it.
5 months ago, I decided to end things with my bf of 3 years. During our last quarrel, i felt that we were not compatible and I don’t see a future with him anymore. I’m looking for a guy that will treat me well, and he is not treating me the way I want to be treated. He is putting way too much priorities over his life and his friends over me. We only meet once a week and it probably was just dinner depending on availability and there were no new activities in our life and it felt that our whole relationship has gone into a stagnant phase, and both of us were not growing at all. Sparks started dying off, I felt like I deserved better, and eventually convinced myself to give up the relationship. And also to make things clear, there wasn’t abuse or cheating involved in our relationship.
2-3 weeks after the breakup(he continued trying for another 4-6weeks), he started coming back to beg me to stay, something that he would never have done for me before. He started saying sweet things like how our break up has affected him and how he can’t live without me. How much he wanted me back in his life and how he would change for me.
At that point of time, i still love him and care for him, but I think this relationship is not going to get anywhere, I spent weeks to convince myself that leaving is for the better good. I was overwhelmed with negative emotions and everything he said just turned me off. So of course I started ghosting him, and took weeks to reply him, despite him sending the long messages about how much he missed me and asking me to meet. Eventually he stopped trying.
I’m actually a stubbornly strong lady, the first two months of letting go, I was in pain, I still love him alot and can’t let go of him. But I told myself it’s going to get better without him. I forced myself to believe that it is over, I will have a better future ahead of me, I will find someone that will treat me better. Everyday, I told myself I will never return to my ex, I deserve better than him. The first month of no texting, I just felt neutral, it doesn’t hurt me as much, as I thought I have already moved on.
Fast forward to a month later after he stopped texting me, I broke down. The emptiness inside me start to swallow me up. I realised I can’t let go of him, I can’t give him up, my life is not the same without him. The months I spent to convince myself that he is not the right one, fell right through. I was in so much pain, I can’t sleep properly at night, I can’t even set my mind straight.
So finally last month, I let down my ego and reached out to him(lucky he didn’t blocked me). Turns out he is still waiting for me. He told me how happy he is to receive my text, he waited me for patiently all this while cause he felt like I needed the space. He never gave up on us despite my no replies and my resistance to meet him. And now we are back together. Spending the Christmas and New Year together.
He is totally a changed man now. He held to his promises so far for 2 months, I can see he really changed. He is putting his 101% into our relationship now. I guess this is where they say “only know how to treasure it when you lose it”. And the pain that I felt during the break, it’s something I never want to experience again, and I thank god for him not giving up on me during our break up period. In fact this break up period made us realise how much we love each other and strengthen our relationship even more.
To all the couples out there, if there were not lying, cheating, abusing in your relationship, even though at some point you lose all your spark and want to give up on the relationship, asked for a break up, it’s very normal, it’s part of life, sometimes it takes space to deepen your love for each other. If he seems sincere in coming back to your life, there is no harm trying again, at the very worst, you can breakup again in another 1-2 months if you noticed he didn’t change. Don’t let the ego of yourself of not going back to your Ex stand in the way, if he can drop his ego to beg for you to stay, likewise you can do the same.
At the end of the day, we just want a guy that is willing to love us, fight for us and never give up on us. It’s never easy for a guy to start begging a girl. Likewise, do not give up on your SO. Sometimes we can be really stupid and needs a breakup to realise what we really want. Of course that is if your SO, is still willing to fight for you. Good luck to all the couples out there and wish your relationship all the best!
