61084,108150,"How much do you guys typically spend on a weekend trip to Japan? Total expenses. I see a lot of young couples my age traveling and I can never convince myself to part with spending more than $1000 over a weekend even though I make six-figures in tech. 
Perhaps also an out-of-line question, do you guys not worry about your retirement? Like since I was in my first year of uni I had dreams of retiring at the age of 40-45. I’m saving every cent that I don’t absolutely have to spend and still it seems like I’m not saving enough. But then I see my peers going to Japan one weekend, Korea another, and then Europe. I am 28 and I just hit 6 figures last year. Am I behind in income for my age? How much of your disposable do you typically end up saving per year? I save around 50% of my after tax income last year. My parents saved a much higher percentage when they were still working. Do people just not save? 
Follow up question: I am saving up for my first rental property. Is this a goal of every young person or are there far better stores of wealth that I’m not aware of?

61089,108162,"My appearance is not suitable for dating... I've received a lot of rejections... in my lifetime.
I recently joined a dating app so called kind of high-end dating apps... 
It had member requirements like good career, or NUS graduates, people with high income, or women with good looks, etc. Anyway, I joined with my diploma, but it's kind of frustrating because I see girls contacting me just based on my accomplishment. I'm afraid to meet them for same reason too.
I want to love them regardless of what I've achieved, but where can I find someone like that? I don't have much confidence. It is too late?

61081,108144,"Am I gaslighted or overthinking?
I’m one month postpartum and I believe that I wasn’t the same person I was before. Please help me and give me advice. 
For context, my husband has an ex, which was a dear friend to him prior their relationship. During our dating stage, he was open to tell me that he wanted to reconnect with her cos he still sees her as a friend. But this ex has blocked him from her socials and no communication since their breakup. They have common friends so he was informed that she was getting married (this happened 2021) But he doesn’t have any updates with her since then. We got married recently and also I have given birth also. 
Now, one day, I woke up in the middle of the night, and he was in the toilet. He left his computer on, out of curiosity I checked his recently closed tabs until I saw that he was looking at his ex’s FB profile (using dummy account). I know it’s wrong cos I invaded his privacy but I was just curious what he’s doing on his computer while I sleep. I confronted him about it and he told me that he felt that I violated his privacy. He even said that I had nothing to worry about and he had been open how he wanted to reconnect with her. Moreover, he said that it’s scary that I snooped on his computer like that and he didn’t once do it to me cos he respects my privacy and he trusts me. When I asked him why he was stalking his ex, he said that it wasn’t stalking but more like he wanted to see how she was doing. The argument led me apologizing to him for invading his privacy. He even said that he sees nothing wrong with what he did. 
I wasn’t like this before I give birth but now I’m too sensitive about everything. Are my feelings even valid or was it really my wrong for checking his recently closed tabs out of curiosity?

61090,108165,"I just ended a 2006 days relationship with someone I was planning to propose to. It hurts but I know the correct advice is to move on.
I still remember the day I first saw her, our first date, the first time we held hands. The bits and pieces of us we leave behind in our rooms or belongings. All these memories are now reduced to objects.
How does one move on from this when one gets blindsided by it? When they are told it would be better and healthier for them to move on. When they know their partner is already contemplating on pursuing something with someone else.
Is it my fault that I took too long before proposing? Or that I thought we could go through anything as long as we stand by each other?
My friends tell me to not lose confidence in myself and that she just decided she wanted something else. Sound advice though a tough pill to swallow.
I believe nothing would change her mind anymore but I hope this reaches her since she might come across this.
I would like to wish you the best in life and thank you for all these years. I’ve loved you deeply and might always have a little place in my soul reserved for you. Be happy with whoever you end up with.

61080,108143,"PSA: To the girl who sat beside me on the Downtown line MRT and traveled all the way to Bukit Panjang MRT station today (Monday, 23 Oct 2023), at around 10pm, I felt a strong attraction towards you and really regret not asking for your number.
You were wearing black long-sleeved-top/cardigan, and blue jeans, with black shoes. You were on your phone most of the time throughout the ride. During the ride, I considered back and forth about asking for your number, I wondered what if I get shouted at for approaching a girl in public, especially in Singapore's conservative society. And it's not like I have a lot of experience approaching girls in public too.
When we alighted, I was tired from the workday, but something about you gave me a rejuvenating essence and aura when I saw you walking in front of me. I contemplated stopping you to ask for your number as we went up the escalator, but upon reaching the end of the escalator, you soon went a different direction opposed to where I intended to go, and I chickened out.
I came across you again outside the bus interchange at the escalator minutes later, but I was too much of a pussy and didn't stop you and took a chance to ask. Sigh, should had grown some balls...
If this is you and you came across this post, please comment below the outfit I was wearing (what top, what bottom (what colour was my top and bottom for better accuracy so I know it's you)), and bonus if you can say what I was holding too so I know it's you fo sure. Would be nice to take you out on a date! I'm taking a chance here guys, this could be fate.
Do your fellow Singaporean son here a favour and help share this post guys!
And to the guys out there, learn from my mistakes, next time if you see a girl you like outside, muster up some courage and just try to chat her up a bit and then get her number. I dilly-dallied so much and missed an opportunity.

61087,108159,"Hi, could anyone please confirm if my approach is correct? Additionally, I would appreciate your feedback or advice.
I am a 35-year-old foreigner who had been unemployed for seven months since April, including the period after my last job interview, which eventually led to my current position. I dedicated numerous hours every day to job applications. The time spent editing my resume and writing cover letters was incredibly extensive. I even recorded my applications in an Excel sheet, totalling just over 200. Despite holding a PhD in life sciences from a local university and having 3 years of work experience, I found it deeply disheartening not to receive a single job offer in about six months. Out of these 200+ applications, I only had five job interviews, all of which I believe I performed extremely well in. The challenges arose due to factors such as retrenchment, the closure of biotech start-ups, switch in government's plan for the nation, and funding cuts across research institutes. Moreover, there have been restrictions on hiring foreigners over the past 6-7 months, as observed from my foreign friends who also struggled to find jobs in Singapore. Regardless of my skills, background, knowledge, and experience aligning with job descriptions, I suspect my applications were often disregarded based on nationality.
After three months of job hunting, I broadened my options to include opportunities slightly outside my expertise, including non-research roles. About three months later, I progressed through two rounds of interviews for a position I'm not particularly interested in. I decided to accept it to sustain myself financially, planning to explore better opportunities in research later on. I couldn't afford to stay unemployed any longer, so I opted for this job that could provide income, even if it wasn't my ideal choice.
Here's where the discouragement sets in. Some of my friends, including locals, criticized me for taking a job meant for more qualified candidates. They argued that these candidates might be more passionate and productive, thus it would be better for the company to hire them instead. Others questioned why I would settle for a job unsuited to my interests, implying that it would lead me back to square one if I quit after a few months. They also questioned the value of learning new skills if I wouldn't use them in the long run when I returned to research.
I understand that highly qualified jobs are valuable and might be better suited for candidates with more relevant skills. However, am I wrong for taking a job out of necessity? I underwent tertiary education, spent months applying for jobs, put extensive effort into interview preparations, and went through the formal hiring process like any other candidate. Why am I wrong for securing a job that isn't my primary interest? Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

61091,108166,"Hi Prof Ben, I would like to hear your views on taking a Masters Degree. I recalled that you commented several times here on NUSWhispers that Masters Degrees are not useful. If so isn't it contradicting that NUS is constantly promoting the postgrad programs? Why did you take up a Master then PhD degree yourself too?

61083,108148,"Disclaimer: Just sharing my two cents here, no offense to anyone.
So, let's dive into the wild world of hookup culture, which seems to be all the rage these days. I've been in the education biz for a good five years, and lately, I've been overhearing some young bucks talking about their 'body count.' One time, I strolled past a group, and this gal in her early 20s was proudly declaring that her body count (approx 10?) was higher than the number of people she's actually dated. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to be all judgmental, but it got me thinking - is that something to be proud of? 
Yeah, I'm no spring chicken, but if I ever have a daughter, you better believe I'll be drilling some good ol' values into her. But here's the real question: Why do folks feel the need to flaunt their body counts? Is it a self-esteem thing, like they want to appear 'more wanted? I'm just curious, would love to hear what y'all think about this."" ????????????

61092,108167,"Are there CS grads who never picked up Data science concepts? Shouldn't such important stuff be known by of all people, CS grads themselves? 
I had the opportunity to interview some senior SWEs whom I thought were very experienced. All graduated from NUS SoC 8, 10 or more years ago. Granted they did not have MANGA in their resume but still.... Is NUS CS education actually overrated?
I don't have a CS degree myself but I picked up my programming and DS skills from bootcamps and online courses. These people while faring reasonably ok in basic programming questions knew nuts when I quizzed them on basic DS and ML concepts. It seems to me that they did not bother to keep themselves up-to-date on the latest web frameworks and languages too. 
They claimed they are good in C and Java as they learned that in school. Who uses that nowadays?

61085,108153,"You know what I noticed? I am on the second level of the attractiveness scale. It's like I'm in limbo, not quite hot enough to be the hot girls' first choice, but hot enough to be their rebound when they get dumped by their first choice. Now every time a hot girl is interested in me, I have to figure out what her problem is. 
For instance, there was once a gorgeous girl with long smooth hair, sharp features and a fit and slender body that was shapely in the right areas. We hit it off pretty quick. In fact, she was the one who started talking to me, asked for my number and even paid for our first dinner! Unfortunately, it soon became apparent how such a perfect creature could even be single in the first place. When she got mad about something, oh boy were you in for a ride. Her outbursts were fiery and completely disproportional. It was hard to fathom how one person could be two people so diametrically opposed to each other. And so with a heavy heart, I had to move on. I could not imagine myself being long-term with a girl of such temperament, handsome though she may have been, and I can imagine the guys before me reasoned as much.
And then there was another girl. Beautiful by any conventional standards, cute and fit with glowing hair and zero entitlement. How rare is it to find a drop dead gorgeous cutie who doesn't demand anything? In fact, she was more willing to give me stuff - gifts, food, time etc. - than she was to take from me. We did lots of things together, she was respectful and helpful and we shared our thoughts and desires and everything. Oh, the way people stared at us in the streets. But alas, I discovered that I was the rebound after her breakup of a long-term relationship. She was biding her time and eventually got back with the dude. Oh well.
With other girls though, I've had somewhat of a different experience. But maybe that's a story for another time...
