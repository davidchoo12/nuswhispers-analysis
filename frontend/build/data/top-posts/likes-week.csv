60626,107153,"Dear #107142
I graduated from NUS, have been on Dean's list multiple times. I am in the industry you deemed for less educated people for the past decade. My bosses does not have a degree like me, but they have my utmost respect. They do presentation with extra s or missing s, and cannot differentiate between past tense and present tense. Yes, they are rich, they earn million a year, they sometimes shows their wealth on social media.
I make half a million last year.
I remember my big boss coming to career fair a decade ago. The first thing he said was, don't worry, I am not asking you to be an agent, I am asking you to join my corporate world. He knows, many of the high class university don't want to be associated with agents.
My university classmates, who joined the corporates world, are now directors of MNC. They have no time. They work from Monday to Friday, OT after they come back home, work some more over the weekends. They can hardly breath, they hardly have time for family. Their spouse complain that they marry their work rather than them.
Those agents whom u said are from less educated background, have time to sleep in the morning, can go multiple holidays a year, have time for family and kids.
Every time I meet a client in the CBD area, I got a shock at how long the queue is. Do you know you don't have to join in the queue? I only go out on weekdays, in the morning, where there is no queue. I get to enjoy weekday discount rate. I hardly go out over the weekends, cos that's when all the crowds are out.
I have time to type out this reply during office hours.
My friends who are in the corporate world, often ask me how to join my industry, as they are sick and tired of reporting to work and facing those irritating colleagues or subpar boss. Yes, they already regional directors in their region.
Yes, you said you have no offence against any job, but your posts seems to be looking down on these people. Little did you know that we are the ones enjoying life with time and money.

60621,107144,"My gf's temper is stressing me out.
We have been together for a year. Mostly our relationship's a good one and we are happy. She is in general an independent person but almost paradoxically at the same time is very obsessed over me. She tells me almost everyday how happy I make her.
Roughly once every two months so far she will get unusually angry over something small like maybe a text message from me to her where the tone can be misinterpreted as being not nice. She will get so unbelievably angry that she will write me walls of angry text, then tell me she is breaking up with me, then block me so I cannot reply. Occasionally she will unblock to write angry messages to me again then block me again. About a week later she will call to apologize. I will talk to her about not doing the same again and we get back together. Cycle repeats.
It is particularly stressful for me because when she says she is breaking up with me and block me, each time I have no idea if it is for real. And each time I believe the same will not happen again because we take the time to talk about each incident in detail after it happens. I have no reason to suspect any trigger because besides these occasional events, the relationship is going well.
What can I do?
And the next time she blocks me and I have a panic attack, should I attempt to reach out to her?

60620,107136,"Dear Prof. Ben,
Just out of curiosity. Are your children as academically-inclined as you are? How do you recommend raising a kid who is bored with school because they find it too easy and slow?
I ask this because my son is showing signs of being way too advanced for his age. He is 11 and for two years now, he has ""hidden"" in my husband's study whenever he has time. My husband and I both work and I only got to know this through my helper. My husband has an applied math PhD from Michigan. The shelves in his study are filled with his old textbooks from school. After I found out that my son was spending an awfully long amount of time in his study, I ask my husband to check him out to see if he was actually learning anything. Turns out, according to my husband anyway, he already knows enough to ace college-level linear algebra and differential equations. My husband is now getting him started on number theory.
I should've been more attentive to the signs because his teachers have always told me that he was disruptive in class and never pays attention. He doesn't do homework, he doodles on his notes, he cracks jokes etc. But he has been among top 5-10 in his cohort despite not keeping up with his schoolwork. I'm afraid the lack of challenge will cause behavioral problems if this carries on.
Unfortunately neither my husband nor I make a lot of money. We don't know many options apart from hoping that he'd be streamed into a more competitive school at 13. My husband, who went to Hwa Chong, said that he'd be bored there too. I'm at my wit's end.

60612,107126,"How big of an age gap is acceptable for guys? Especially if the girl is older?
Last December, I went on a group tour with my family and there was a very cute guy but he is around 5 years younger than me. He is a junior in the same course as me. I am much older than him as I took an unconventional track to uni. During the tour, I realized that I can connect quite well with him and he is a decent person. I have been seeing him around the campus this sem and I realize that I may really like him. He is very introverted and I am ok with initiating. He is still single but I am not sure if I am too old for him. In the past, I was quite disgusted by the thought of dating a younger boy. But as he is mature for his age, I do not feel that he is that much younger. However, I do not know if I will freak him out and I am very hesitant to approach him or even to text him. In this modern world, it is ok for girls to be older, but I wonder if 5 years is a bit too much?

60630,107161,"An alumni here. I was a uni student and was approached for a lucrative side ‘job’ that required me to be an insurance agent by a private agency. The job scope was simple - pass insurance exams, join an insurance company and I will be entitled to a few hundred a month for 24 months. Being the naive and desperate student I was, I readily agreed as I really needed money to tide through a tough time. Years later, this is coming to bite me in my ass as I was accused of fraud by the insurance company. The fine is in tens of thousands and I am not even able to fork out this amount. After contacting the boss of the private agency (name abbreviated as EL), he simply refused to pay and cooperate. This did not only occur to me, and I wanted to bring this to light so that many of you young university students will avoid this trap as they intentionally target young and less well to do individuals for this scam. I was young and stupid, and I learnt my lesson hoping to share this with a wider audience.

60625,107152,"It was 12am on a Wednesday night. I was feeling very hungry. Took a break from studying to get Nasi Lemak. I saw so many others dining out with their friends. But I am a man of mission. Plan to takeaway my Nasi Lemak.
While queuing, I was suddenly distracted. I forgot about my Nasi Lemak and was captivated by the slightly tanned girl in front of me. Long hair, bunned up with henna on her hand. I couldn’t figure out if she’s Chinese or Malay or a foreigner. Even if she’s an alien, i don’t care. I was already smitten. She was busy texting on her phone so I thought she was with a group or with her boyfriend.
Until she took her order, 1 Nasi Lemak, takeaway. And a can of Coke! That’s exactly what I would have ordered on a normal day. But because I’m gonna continue studying after supper, I get myself iced coffee instead. I even forgot what I wanted and mix up my Nasi Lemak order.
Before I could catch up with her after I was done with my takeaway, she turned left while I had to turn right. And that’s probably the last time I’m gonna see her. :(
Impressively, I was more productive after that. If I get an A, she’s definitely my muse. Whoever you are, you definitely have a new secret admirer now.

60619,107142,"Alright before I rant it out, I’d like to be clear to everyone that I have no offence against any jobs or occupations or careers here, as I’m just voicing out my personal opinions.
Having graduated from local uni for 3 years since the pandemic, I’ve worked for 2 companies, and I’d say they’re both pretty fulfilling, as I get to learn a lot of new skills, how to deal with clients especially problematic ones, liaise with customers, having courage to argue with my bosses whenever necessary, pretty much equipped myself with a lot of skills to upgrade myself. However, some of my insurance agent acquaintances and friends who became these so called wealth planners or financial agents have been approaching me to persuade me to join them, telling me things like oh with your skills, you can definitely make it, you have the potential to become very successful, you can easily achieve MDRT within 1-2 year’s time based on your strong selling skills, blab la bla, so on and so forth.
Honestly I’ve met quite a number of insurance agents, be it from uni, from gym, from dating apps, from friends/acquaintances, and 90% of them graduated from private uni, are uni dropouts, or didn’t even complete go to poly/JC, and that is the main reason why I stay away from this industry. They can be ah lian, girls who dress up as if they’re on catwalk, guys with tattoos that are easily noticeable. No offence guys, to me, there are plenty of other jobs that make a good living as well, and these jobs do require uni degrees such as lawyer, doctor, pharmacist, scientist, engineer, lecturer, teacher, merger and acquisition, corporate banker, etc. I really don’t wish to waste my degree on a job that doesn’t need a degree AT ALL. Yes, if I do well, if I can sell, if I can maintain good relationship with client, if I can expand my network, I can make a ton of money from selling wealth plans and my degree is no longer important. I get it, I’m totally aware of it. But from my stand point, I just don’t understand why people keep thinking that we must or more like we should join insurance to make money, I seriously don’t get it. It's just like prostitution, yes, it's legal, you can make a living out of it, but I don't enjoy the job so I don't do it. In fact, I got so mad at one of them and told him straight to his face “eh any tom dick and harry can go join your prudential as long as they put on suit and tie, and can sell, stop trying to pull me in”.
Is it wrong for enjoying a career that requires a uni degree that I enjoy every single day? Frankly speaking, my preference to stay away from a career that is pursued by most less-educated people and unwilling to associate myself with similar people especially those who didn’t go to uni is really just a preference. I don’t enforce anyone to follow my actions, I don’t discriminate them when I’m doing my job, and I certainly never think that it is wrong to pursue a career catered mostly to those less-educated. In fact, in my previous job, I had to deal with any type of customers, and I had a great time talking to them for hours and meeting them for contract discussion outside office.
So guys, if any of your friends DO NOT want to join insurance, just stop forcing them to join. Just take it as we don’t fancy flexing our BMW and Rolex on the Gram can bruh???

60624,107149,"Not sure if anyone has been through something similar but we need your generous thoughts and suggestions (please be nice!).
We are a group of close friends since secondary school, whom are all married/engaged/attached except for A. We are finding it difficult to communicate with A as he enjoys talking about his ""relationship"". We don't see this as a problem, considering how people around us are at this ""time to settle down"" stage in life.
A is an evergreen, early thirties, desperately wanting to meet the love of his life naturally and has no intention to meet new people.
Nothing extreme but we have resorted to referring to our own partner as ""friend"" to avoid the topic as much as we can. If somehow he manages to bring us to the topic, he goes on and on about how single af/left out/left behind he is/ how difficult it is to meet someone, unlike us who got it easy.
Like many other relationships, we met people who then became our partners in school or workplace. He has never dated anyone, never had a crush on anyone. Back in uni days, he shared with us about this one experience he had with a course mate who had confessed to him. She was a pleasant and bubbly girl. We had fun teasing him and tried to match them up. As he did not share the same feelings, he simply told the girl he had no time to date.
Months later, he was suddenly mad and shared how the girl is already dating another course mate and he felt betrayed. He then labeled her a two-timer and all sort of names. Thing is they were never together? The girl is definitely the bigger person. Whenever they see each other at school, she would smile no matter how awkward we thought it would be. A would then continue his insults behind her. Years later, he would refer to her as his ex. An ex who two-timed him and hurt him deeply.
We suggested he could try using dating app or even match making companies. He often says they are useless because he prefers to know someone in real life naturally and not through such methods. Note that he is a homebody. We tried match making our single friends to him, he would reject because it is too awkward for him to meet someone with the purpose to date. As far as we know, noone in his family is pressuring him to marry. His parents are cool even if he remains single.
Are you able to imagine the sort of conversations we have with him? Often, a fun get together would end with this awkward and lousy vibe. With him just whining about being alone, dying alone while the world goes on. He is always on social media, being bitter about friends who posted photos of travels with their partner, getting engaged, getting married, some already with kids (we always get a first hand update of a screenshot from FB along with his comment).
My dear friend, we are at wits' end to help if you put in 0% effort to get out of your comfort zone.

I sacrificed hours days months of my life to study and build up a convincing application and people tell me that my place is well deserved. I wanted a scholarship but I guess I only got a small bursary, and I guess that's enough and better than nothing really so I should really be thankful for it.
My batch mate on the other hand took on a easy research engineer job for 2 years, goes out, plays video games every day, and as far as I know has no publications/work/contribution to his name except for some student competition and he's applied to my postgrad course.
