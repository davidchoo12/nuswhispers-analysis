60856,107669,"Can someone explain to me in very simple and pragmatic terms why I should spend a single sec trying to learn my dialect (Teochew) than to learn an actual useful language like French or German in addition to English and Mandarin?
A lot of people get all hostile about “remembering your roots” but I can’t remember a single instance in my life where I was paid for being able to do what my ancestors did. My grandfather used to have oil lamps, do I have to learn that? He drove a manual shift car? Should I learn that? Once he got sick and he picked some random wild plants from the side of the road and made tea out of it instead of eating his antibiotics. He died without having eaten a single pill that was prescribed to him by a Mount Elizabeth doctor. Should I learn that?
There needs to be a system by which people pick and choose which aspects of our ancestors’ lives we ought to learn from. What is that system? Based on usefulness? What is the metric?
It’s funny people advocate for things that isn’t fundamentally helpful to the actual struggles of life, most of which are material. Please let us advocate first making a living and then you can learn whatever obscure language or tradition if you have spare time.

60855,107665,"My girlfriend recently came back from her overseas exchange, and I feel like she is a changed person.
She used to be so helpful and easy-going. Nowadays she only likes to argue and badmouth me, and she keeps talking about BTO.
She used to be very cute and innocent. Nowadays she likes to watch raunchy TV shows like Game of Thrones and she moves her head up and down when drinking BBT.
Sometimes I feel like breaking up with her, but I love her too much...

60848,107652,"Response to #107607
About myself : Public Officer from non-STEM background (managed non-IT projects), pivoted to the IT Department with focus on Data Analytics.
Did General Assembly's part-time bootcamp in Data Science in 2017, then the NUS Grad Cert (GC) in Computing Foundations three years later, joined the IT department in another agency a few months after supporting video analytics projects as a minor portfolio (was in a different department doing my major portfolio.)
1 year and 9 months later, the IT dept became my major portfolio as I now help to manage data analytics projects, organize data analytics capacity-building initiatives (courses for staff!); and even supporting change management for the rollout of a major operations system. I joined the GC programme with the intention of doing the MComp in the near future but still managed to pivot to an IT role without pursuing MComp.
As Profs Ben and Alan already covered the difference between the GC and MComp, I will not repeat these points and I fully agree with their points. I will address the issue of bootcamp vs NUS.
NUS professors like Prof Alan would make these bootcamp instructors look like scammers and fakers when it comes to teaching Python programming (and other stuff). Let me illustrate this with a simple use case of sorting a list of numbers.
In any bootcamp, you just code list.sort() and that's it. However in IT5001, you aren't allowed to use the sort() method, you are forced to think more critically about the different kinds of sorts and how the sort() method may not necessarily be the most efficient algorithm to run. This would be a valuable lesson that bootcamps don't necessarily teach you but can make a difference when managing apps and systems.
Also, in the GC/MComp you have to take multiple modules beyond the traditional ambit of a SWE / Data Scientist / Business Analyst etc. You are exposed to the importance of understanding the larger picture of IT systems and how different IT professionals need to work together to provide the infrastructure and systems support for everyone to do their tasks well (eg. IT5002, IT5003). This is something all bootcamps can't do because they are only limited to the singular focus of the course, at most they can only guide participants to be astute to business needs and that's all. Having some basic knowledge of other IT disciplines beyond one's main specialty would give you a big advantage over those who can't; because business challenges can't be addressed because we have to spend more time trying to address the system / software / security issues before you can even analyze the data and solve the business problem (speaking in my data scientist lens).
Assumming after covering subsidies for SC/PR, Bootcamps cost between on average $3 -6K and you only learn one toolkit; while on the other hand you spend around $4.5K for the GC and you learn more than one toolkit in one go, so go figure out the math. If you compare the full-time bootcamps vs doing the GC full-time, the duration is similar.
P/S - If you are a public officer and if you're interested in data science, please don't throw your money at these bootcamps. These bootcamps (GA, Vertical Institute, JCube Institute, Le Wagon etc etc.) don't deserve your money at all no matter how reputable they are. Go join GovTech Data Champions Bootcamp which is totally free-of-charge and you get to learn Python + Power BI / Qlik Sense / Tableau; and you get to cover at least 70% of the Data Science / Machine Learning toolkits in the bootcamp. Although it's not meant for you to pivot to a data science role but at least you save alot of money. You've a larger community of peers to get help from; and also less pressure to pass (unlike NUS and the bootcamps, for obvious reasons).

60850,107656,"Question for my fellow NUS alumni: is there any point in staying long term at a company?
Worked for three years, annual increments were 7-15% at the same workplace. I started looking elsewhere and there were offers coming in with increases of 20-30% at different companies.
I left my previous workplace and have now worked at a different company for a year - but it seems like the annual raise is once again nothing compared to my 'personal' raise if I just hopped to a different company?
So what is the point of staying long term in any company? Experience? Can be gained regardless of which company it is.
Messy CV? No one really cares as long as you do proper work and have decent references.

60854,107664,"I feel like this is something I can’t really talk to people about, and I really need to let it out in the world. Even my closest friends, although they have some idea, they don’t really know the extent of it. I’ve been in love with a guy for almost 6 years now. I don’t know if it’s love. I wouldn’t even know what to call it. We haven’t even spent that much time together, but it was truly love at first sight (or love at first meeting at least). The little time we’ve spent together in last few years has been eclectic. I’ve never felt the way that I feel with him with anyone else.
Now here’s where the thing gets complicated. I’ve been in a very very serious relationship for 5 years. Don’t get me wrong, I truly do love my boyfriend very very much, and I do see a future with him. We will probably get married one day. He’s perfect for me in all the right ways.
However, I can’t get the thought of the other guy out of my mind. I think of him every day, even when I don’t see him for months at a stretch. My body shakes every time I see him. I know he’s not good for me, and he’s quite manipulative but despite knowing all the bad things about him, I still can’t let him go. It’s been years, and I can’t let him go. I think it’s reciprocated from his side, and he’s expressed it subtly a few times, but he will never own up to it or have a genuine conversation and it because that’s just how he is. I am 100 percent sure he’s not right for me, but I still can’t move on from him. No matter what he does or what I hear about him. I can swear there’s something inexplainable between us. He even makes my body and mind respond in strange ways.
I love my boyfriend and know he’s the correct choice- he’s amazing too and he makes my life better by just being in it. I don’t know how to move on from the other guy- tried hating him, giving it time, tried everything but it’s been years and he still has the same effect on me.
What should I do?

60857,107670,"Dear Prof Ben,
I suffer from really bad depression because of underachievement due to laziness and I have attempted suicide two times.
I was the top student of my primary school and a Raffles Academy student. I never had any tuition, never really did homework, but life has been very accommodating of me. I went into JC with a near perfect grades in sec 4. I then decided to join a sports CCA and because I never did sports, it affected me physically and I put in zero work through J1. I did not promote and my parents decided to take me out of school and they sent me to the US to do community college. My parents are both specialists so my family is well-to-do.
I did two semesters, started working hard for the first time in my life and transferred to MIT course 18. When I was there, old habits returned and I started binging shows on Netflix and didn’t a crap about coursework. I was put on academic warning. My parents made me take an LOA and now I’ve been trapped at home. I did therapy and stuff. They made me do volunteer work, I worked as a Starbucks barista, I started running etc. During all of this I cut myself twice and both times I got saved by my brother.
I hate that when I sit down to study, I would understand quickly, very quickly, drift off during classes and then not practice because I believed that I already understand the material and then I would fail. I hate myself because a part of me keeps letting myself down even though I do want to work. I want to work hard. But I can’t control this voice in my head that keeps sending me wrong signals that “okay you got it.” I don’t want to cut myself again.

60847,107650,"If a boy like the one in #107611 ever approached my daughter in that way, I might actually give him more consideration.
Am a long-term working Mum with a daughter in NUS.
She has faced her fair share of dating and it has been quite a disaster. Either the boy had differences or that she faced bouts of being cheated on.
Most of her boyfriends were found either in school or on a dating app. Just because those boys went via the so-called ""acceptable"" means to find a date, doesn't guarantee my approval nor did they treat my daughter properly.
As much as I don't know enough on this specific boy, I have never seen anyone in ages writing sincere. wholesome notes to others. It is such a nostalgic throwback to my time of dating. Everything being much simpler, face-to-face and genuine.
I may still feel sceptical on behalf of my daughter given he is still a total stranger. However, I would still support my daughter to consider him a try.
At least my daughter would have already seen and vibed the boy in real life. Not like on those silly dating apps where whatever you see on a ""profile"" is not necessarily what you get in real life.
A mother's instinct is unlikely to go wrong. I can at least sit right that he's more likely to treat my daughter better than what she has already faced.
PS: Unless you have a daughter, stop using the ""imagine xxx hit on your daughter"" to put others down. You are not a parent yourself. Don't speak on behalf of actual parents.

60853,107660,"We talk so much about how it’s wrong to expect females to have stereotypically “feminine” behaviours, like being demure or doing housework. Sure, I agree. We shouldn’t be expected to do certain things because of gender attributes.
Why, then, is it completely ok the other way round? My guy friends are routinely dragged out by their partners or female friends for the sole purpose of being shopping bag carriers, drivers, and/or ATMs. We’re the de facto leftover food finishers whether we want to be or not. And no, not all guys are ok with cockroaches, nor do all of us have some innate DIY expertise, or whatever stereotypically “guy” thing we’re expected to do. Furthermore, asking these types of questions elicits banal responses like “who hurt you?” instead of any effort to understand.
Sure, some guys are ok with being “the guy”. But if there can be an expectation one way, then it should go the other way too. If not, then women can pay for and carry their own things, walk on any side of the road, and stomp their own darn pests.
