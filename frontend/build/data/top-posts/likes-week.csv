60827,107628,"In JC, I was caught wanking in the school library. I graduated with straight As for my Alevels but the recommendation letter from my JC was quite bad (for obvious reasons) so I got multiple rejections and ended up in NUS CS.
How long will the library incident affect my my reputation? It is already several years now, but I often overhear unkind comments and it is difficult to find groupmates who are willing to work with me on projects. It really seems quite unfair and I am considering emigrating overseas just to avoid the unfair discrimination.
@ProfBen: Do you have any career advice for someone in my situation? I have no evidence but it feels like I am missing out on career opportunities because of this ""black mark"" on my record.

60831,107633,"I really think that the world will be a better place without my mum and people like her. She is everything that's harmful for the society: racist, homophobic, gosip monger, etc. She treated me like an investment and even unhappy that I only booked a 4-star hotels for her instead of a 5-star ones for our trip to Bali.
I got a scholarship when I was 15, so she actually didn't spent much money on me as she barely gave me allowance but she paid off my brother's tuition loan fee debt and even sponsor him to study in Europe for his master. She always get sensitive when I brought this up and start emotional blackmailing me saying that she is old (she is only 62, not even that old) and doesn't have much time left (lol, how I wish). I suspect that she has a mental illness. She is really toxic and I just hope to cut her off from my life. But I love my dad, so I cannot just cut her off and just keep my dad.

60828,107629,"I can't relate to a lot of people's common childhood experiences. And I feel pretty left out.
Example 1 : People told me that they need to hide under the blanket to feel safe from potential ""ghost"" attacking. Or they won't let their foot hang outside of the bed area or else something will pull them. I couldn't relate cause logically if there's ghost or monsters, why are they so immune to the blanket when they can just take it off and attack you?
Example 2 : People told me they felt panic when their mom asked to wait in line to pay while she go get something, and as the line moves pretty fast, people told me the panic is real cause their mom is not back yet to pay and it's close to their turn at the cashier. I couldn't relate to the panic feeling cause when my mom asked me to wait in line, and when it's my turn, I simply just say I'm sorry and that my mom is not here yet, so I just went back in line. What is there to panic about? Obviously you can't pay, so just go back.
And many other childhood things people typically experiences, I just couldn't relate. Everyone seems to bond really well when they talk about it. I feel really left out.
No one ever experienced the things I do in a different way of thinking too I guess.

60822,107619,"I think about smoking these days. I'm a non-smoker and have a never touched a stick in my life.
I think it's my little fantasy to be able to do what I want in a job that I don't seem to have control of which is causing me a lot of stress.
Or maybe it's my cry to paint a picture of self pity. You know, eyes glazed, with a stick in one hand, with the other hand holding my head.
But I can't. Men aren't supposed to show self pity. I'm 39, I have a newborn son, so stick to this job in these uncertain times and suck it up.
Don't even talk to your partner about it because she's not going to give the pity you yearn for. She wants you to go solve your problems at work. ""Why aren't you making things better for yourself?"" she implies. Well, if only it were that simple.
I need a smoke. And I haven't even done one before.

60824,107624,"TLDR: AITA for feeling this way?
Hi, I'm a 26Y (F) and my Bf 28Y (M). We've been in a stable relationship for the past 4.5 years and recently applied for a BTO as we plan to settle down soon. With work being hectic, we decided to clear our leaves & take a 14-days getaway to Europe. We've already planned the itinerary and made the necessary bookings, but now his mother wants to join us at the final minute. While I don't mind her coming along, she's suggesting additional activities that we're not particularly interested in, and I'm feeling pressured to add in the itinerary. To make matters more complicated, she's also invited her extended family, turning our ""honeymoon"" holiday into a family trip. I've proposed having some days dedicated to spending time with his family and others for just the two of us, in an attempt to find a compromise. Despite my willingness to find a compromise, she insisted that we should stick together due to the unfamiliar environment. Although this trip was intended to be a time of relaxation and rejuvenation, I find myself feeling both confused and stressed. I understand and appreciate his close relationship with his mother but these emotions are beyond my control.

I’m sorry I lied all those years ago when I said my depression was getting better when it truly wasn’t.
You looked so crestfallen when you couldn’t help me. And so happy when I made slight progress.
Maybe the faking to make myself look happy helped.
I’m better now. But I’m sorry I lied then.
I shouldn’t have. then I could have gotten the help I needed earlier.

60829,107630,"sorry for the long post ahead!!!
The company I'm interning at now planned nothing for me during my summer internship.
This internship was different from what I was studying but still somewhat relevant. During the interview, it was discussed with me that i would be involved in an implementation project, but after accepting it and a few weeks before the start of the internship, I was informed of a change in my supervisor due to restructuring which i didnt think much of as i assumed the work would be the same.
But on day one, I found out that my supervisor changed as the department's division that I was supposed to be tagged to was consolidated with a third party company within the same building with all the projects being handed over to them. and my supposed department's job scope had completely changed! My supervisor had nothing planned for me and put me under them where they were nice enough to let me tag along, but this also meant I am always in a different office from my supposed supervisor. I didn't ask my sch's mentor for advice bc i assumed it would be fine, pls dont flame me i just wanted to learn to be independent;-;
So ever since day 1, I have been trying to learn from the third party team I am tagged to, and having to ask for work every day for 2months now. Luckily for me, the third party team was nice enough to give me 2 projects to work on both with very different job scopes.
I know i shouldnt be complaining about this but the projects were mostly put on hold most of the time after I've reached a deliverable, and now one of them has been on hold for a month as they do not have a no way for me to test the prototype due to their restrictions and slow response time from seeking approvals/advice on their side. and my2nd project just came a few weeks ago and is also delayed due to slow response from clients. so ive still been just asking for work daily while waiting, ive been given some adhoc tasks which i completed quickly and properly, other than that theres mostly nothing to do at my desk. i do try to watch/learn new things online during this ""free"" time but i just feel so useless during these 2 months.
To add on, because the 1st projecthad no deadlines, my workplan was not very detailed even after discussing it with the third party team and my supposed supervisor. so it got rejected and now i have to submit a revised one, and i think the sch's mentor seemed unhappy about it in his comments saying im learning lesser. so now im worried about the doing the sch report and end of internship presentation :( i've still been asking for work and projects to be involved in but there's nothing much going on with my projects and in general while I wait...
what should i do for my report and presentation? and for my final month while waiting for said projects?

60820,107617,"I am together with this girl for about 2-years already. She has totally no financial goals and plannings but still expects to have a car, grand wedding and nice renovated house. All these items mentioned above does not come cheap and serious planning would be needed.
Furthermore, when going out, small meals like food would be paid directly by me as she does not bring her wallet along, knowing that I would pay for them. I am alright to pay for small meals which are lesser than $10 per person but I would want to go dutch on shopping mall restaurants as they are generally more expensive. Overall, I am just a student with a part-time job that pays me enough to survive by myself. She would pay me back whenever her parents gives her allowance but would usually end up in debt since the allowance would be spend on other items such as clothing.
Whenever speaking about finances, she would claim that I look at money too seriously.
Should I remain with her till she graduates to see if she has more serious financial planning or should I just break-up?

He is a 31 year old Singaporean who has been working in the US (so he is quite westernized) and now between Korea and Singapore. I continued working part time for the company as his personal assistant because I wanted to keep seeing him and even made the decision to come to Singapore for my final semester so I could spend more time with him. Before I leave home, I want to take the courage to tell him what I feel about him. From his friends, I know he has been through many relationships and used to be quite a casual dater when he was in law school and also when he was in the US. I don't know much about dating culture in Singapore. Is it common for Singaporean guys to date girls from overseas, and are they generally faithful to their partners in a long term partly distance relationship if we only see each other around twice a year for 3 months at a time? What are the struggles for overseas girls dating Singapore guys? Would be grateful to hear other experiences

60825,107626,"Find it really weird that some people are in such disagreement with being frugal and saving for retirement. The most common reason I’ve read is “you’re going to grow old and miss out on all the things you could have done with your youthful energy.”
Let’s run a thought experiment. Assuming you don’t save right. When you’re 60 (and the life expectancy in Singapore is at least 80), and your income goes to zero, what then? Whether you remember your 20s and 30s for all the things you did, you will hit 60. Barring any freak accidents, we will all hit 60. Inflation would have happened at least for 30 years. If you hadn’t built enough wealth or passive income by then, you’re going to have a really difficult time bootstrapping for resources as an older person with obsolete skills.
By my age, my uncle (now 50) already had 2 apartments paying him rent. Because of extremely thoughtful financial planning, he was able to retire at 45. Most of his money came from his real estate investments. He travels monthly, goes to concerts, drives an Audi, eats at atas restaurants, life is great for him. His trick was fairly simple. He spent a minimal amount of money for the first 10 years except on necessities and investments; for the next 10 when his income blew up he made larger investments. By his 40s he was already worth 8 figures. He was an Oxbridge trained lawyer and a retired as a senior partner.
Is 45 really that old? He runs 2.4km faster than I can run at half his age. I’m not saying everyone can make a lot of money just by being frugal and delaying gratification; but whatever the case, it would be more than spending $500 on a Taylor Swift concert when you’re only earning $3000. That’s more than 15% of your income on a useless thing!
The next thing you know all these people are going to start calling for communism because they didn’t work hard on their wealth and are somehow surprised when they don’t have money when they need it.

60826,107627,"Should I go for SEP?
Hi everyone, I recently got offered SEP and I am in a dilemma right now for a few reasons:
1. I applied with my friends but did not get the same uni as them sadly. If we got the same uni I wouldn’t be hesitating right now. What I hope for is to have at least one TRUSTED friend that can stick with me while also traveling together throughout SEP, for safety reasons. Basically someone I can rely on (mutual ofc) when we are overseas by ourselves.
2. Cost. If I go on SEP, I will have to take a loan. Basically enjoy now and suffer later.
3. The reason why I hope to go for SEP is because I would love to experience a different environment, travel and enjoy pass/fail mods.
Hope readers can give me some advice whether or not to go for it. I know SEP will be a life-changing experience, I’m just not sure if it is worth it (especially when it comes to being in debt after I graduate)
Thank you in advance!
