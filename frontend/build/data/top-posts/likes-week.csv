61128,108238,"I just want to keep my post short because there is already too much said about the subject online. 
I am a Year 4 NUS Architecture student, and as I am nearing the end of my studies, I really really cannot fathom, how is it that NUS architecture as an organization has survived for so many decades, without teaching anything and being so useless education wise. Let me say this, you don't learn anything in the 4 years and I am struggling to actually understand what its all worth as I am nearing the end.
It really reminds me of an Emperor with no Clothes. Moreover, I cannot believe its only last year in 2022, that the larger Public, knew about how bad things are in NUS architecture. I just wish I knew better and had some foresight, before enrolling...

61131,108246,"I graduated recently from NUS and had the best memories in halls with a close group of friends. Sharing this because I thought this was one of the most memorable convos. 
My female 'bro' friend once shared with the group that she had s3x with an ang moh after clubbing. Apparently, this had always been one of the things she wanted to on accomplish her 'to do' list. So I asked her how was the experience and she said it was the best, supposedly because he was the biggest she ever had. And then I asked her how big is he, and she said he was really very big. So I asked her exactly how big because we were all curious. She said she was also not sure because she didn't measure. So we took out a ruler and asked her to give an estimate. Then she used her hands to estimate 11-12cm... And she was so serious about 11-12cm being really very big. I was speechless I swear. For info, she is quite open about being sexually active and had about 10+ different sexual partners previously. I found it so confusing yet so funny because I thought 11-12cm was normal? Worst, the girls in the group got so excited and even agreed with her!! One of them even has a bf with only 7cm and she is very satisfied. Ok but to be fair they are all quite petite about 160cm and I am 183cm for reference, so not judging anyone for anything. 
We are all happily attached now and I really cherished all our healthy and honest convos about relationships and s3x during our university days. I appreciated how we approached such taboo topics as mature young adults. It really helped me grow a lot as a person and as a man to have such cool and solid friends. And I just want to say thank you to all of them.

61127,108237,"Don't you love it whenever the topic of NS is brought up, there're many people who'll say, ""yeah it's the duty of a Singaporean son"", ""you gotta give back 2 years for the prosperity of your country"", etc.
Prosperity is not just defined by the GDP or GDP per capita of a country, it's how happy the average citizens are, not just the wealthiest or the most well-connected citizens. When we talk about Singapore getting more prosperous, are we talking about our average salaries going up? Our standards of living improving? Our society getting more harmonious and trusting? Our healthcare services and education quality improving? Or are we talking about how much rich foreigners are willing to bring $$ into Singapore, jacking up housing prices and prices of everyday goods?
When the average Singaporean son sacrifices 2 years of his life for the country, he firstly and foremost protects the interests of people in positions of power and wealthy elites, as a matter of fact. And he gets little in return. Things you learn in NS, you can rarely ever apply it to a corporate job. Not mention how NS destroys the psyche and impairs the long term mental health of NSFs esp if you're not an officer or commander. It brainwashes you into obedience to authority, puts you in the position where you're the bottom barrel of society, and delays 2 years of your career progression while others have already graduated when you begin your university. It destroys the self esteem to a great extent.
To all those pro-conscription folks saying that the willingness of sacrificing one's life for their country is a sign of a ""good citizen"", all I can say is that if a country requires their own citizens to lose their lives, that country is not worth protecting in the first place.

61125,108233,"I just want to comment on how rude, arrogant, selfish and unkind NUS students are nowadays. Today I met two extremely ill-mannered and arrogant students. One of them took up 2 seats in the bus and was unhappy and reluctant to shift when I politely said ""Excuse me"". Later on when he was alighting, he purposely hit me with his huge bag and pretended like nothing happened. I told him off but he was acting so smug and arrogant and was imitating me. Honestly, such quality of students, please don't study in NUS, should go back to primary school to relearn his moral education and manners. Another girl was so rude, she was literally pushing me all the way when we were inside the lift for no reason. I honestly don't understand if stress is getting to all of us or is it because the government is emphasising so much on education that young people just forgot about moral values and mannerism? This would be a laughing stock if the public sees how NUS students behave so immaturely.

61126,108236,"How to help a friend who broke up without losing my shit??
So my friend had a bad breakup early last year. While she has been very proactive in dealing with the aftermath (trying new hobbies, spending more time with her family, even seeing a psychiatrist), I think that she also hampers her own efforts by (1) having a really low bar for online dating in an attempt to find a new bf and (2) still talking about her ex. I mean, for (1) I've lost count of how many times I literally had to point out so many red flags in the text screenshots. I would say some of them are even worse than your ex. (2) WHY THE FLYING HECK ARE YOU TELLING ME ABOUT WHAT YOU HEAR D ABOUT HIM?? He gaslighted you throughout the entire r/s and caused you to faint from stress multiple times but you still interested in his life for what???
Knowing her she is both forward-looking and introspective, but more often than not it gives rise to behaviour I don't understand, such as trying to find new gossip about people she fell out with like years back?? Like what would you gain out of this at all?? Then of course when her ex became one of these people this behaviour just got worse and even affected her health??
I'm damn exhausted. Been trying to advise her so many times but she just continues to ""date"" shitty guys and periodically spiral over her ex. I think her psychiatrist also got problem, almost coming to 2 years and this idiot still keeps taking 1 step forward and 2 steps back.
Any friend expert is welcome to advise, scold me also can. I'm reaching my wits' end. Gamxia hamida

61132,108248,"Hello world. Am a 24yo guy. I need some motivation/advice for dating (the usuals). I am thinking of who I should proceed in knowing more as a romantic interest.
Girl A is someone I met in school. She is introverted and friendly. She vibes p well with me. She is 3 years my junior. 
Girl B is someone I met on a dating app. Before you rule her out, rest assured that she vibes well with me and have p similar interests/hobbies too. She is 4 years older than me. 
Personally, I have interacted more with Girl A. I am also inclined towards Girl A as well, mainly because I shared more time with her. However, I am getting the impression that she may not be as romantically interested in me as Girl B. On the other hand, Girl B and I share more common topics, but her age may be a problem (age is subjective). Girl B also shares a similar level of emotional maturity as me, but Girl A falls close as well.
Not that I will decide on what to do based on the replies, but I am curious to know what this society thinks about the issue. All feedbacks are welcomed!

61124,108231,"Mediocre friend who sucks the living soul out of me. 
I kept the friendship going because of a mutual good friend who begged to keep X around. X is constantly negative and overthinks about every situation all the time. When no one is looking or even thinking about her, she would come up with length speeches of her paranoia about her appearance or body and how people see her. No amount of assurance can make her feel better. I'm very tired of X and had since reduced contact with my good friend whenever X is present. 
The group chat of us 3 is worse. I almost never read it because its constant whining about her insecurities and fishing us to give her more assurance which doesn't work. My good friend finds it hard to reject X so has been a listening ear and supportive pillar of strength to X. But time passes, even my good friend is tired of listening to X. There's no give and take when it comes to X. She's so bloody needy all the time and demanding of our attention over her endless worries. 
Other than leaving her alone, I don't know what to do because X constantly inserts herself in me and my good friend's conversation.  
How to make her stop whining? It's hard to cut her out of our lives now because we still have to see each other everyday.

61130,108240,"Thank you Dr Rajesh for inviting the guest speaker in EE2028. 
I never knew embedded product manufacturing still existed in Singapore. I had the misconception everything has been outsourced to China and there are no more good engineering jobs left. 
To tell the truth, I'm in EE because I failed to enter CS and CEG. From the beginning, I was always aiming for a software career and I always viewed the EE course as the necessary evil. After some Engin mods, I have to admit I did develop some interest but still viewed software as my main goal. Recent negative posts here about the embedded and engineering industry from seniors has made me wary.
Dr Rajesh and the NUSWhispers community, what are your comments? Should I continue with my software goals like looking for SWE internships? Or should I try searching for embedded internships?

61129,108239,"Response to confession #108222
May be you could ask if she is married/attached? If she is single, you can ask her out after all exams papers have been marked? If you still like her after seeing her outside the classroom context, then you can be sure.
To be honest, I dated one of the profs I met when I took elective from another school. Not sex or romance for grade or anything of that sort cuz we started after exam marking was done. Outside the classroom, the person is completely different. I don't know what is it about the classroom that makes profs and teachers become more attractive than they really are. Haha.
