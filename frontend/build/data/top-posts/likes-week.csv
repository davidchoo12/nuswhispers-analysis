I recall in JC. I could only afford the 90cents white rice with a single fried egg and some cabbage for lunch.
So those of you that have to save and scrimp on food , your day of luxury food (fish for mixed rice) will come eventually. With a nus education and hardwork everything is possible.

I used to read NUSWhispers when I was in NUS. I recall during my first year in NUS, the posts were numbered less than 10k and I'm impressed by how much it has grown up to today. It's fascinating that a student project can get so much attention. So as a curious computing kid, I started building this dashboard. The data and code is open source. I worked on it intermittently for 2 years only when I felt like it. Along the way, I got to learn some React and python data tools. Why do I do this? I honestly don't know haha, just felt like completing it as my side project. I did set buying a road bike as a goal to motivate myself to complete this project. Now I can finally buy that bike!
Admins, if you're reading this, I know this is not your usual confessions kinda post, but just felt right sharing it on the very platform this project is made for. I understand if you decide not to post it on facebook. Feel free to also check it out :D

60296,106497,"I was just 17 years old when my life fell apart. It all started with my first boyfriend. He was my age, and we had been dating for a few months. I thought he was the one, but I was wrong. He got me pregnant twice and I had to get abortions both times. It was a difficult and painful experience, but I thought it was all worth it for love.
My second boyfriend was 9 years older than me. I thought he would be more mature and responsible, but he ended up being just as bad as my first boyfriend. He was controlling and manipulative, and I couldn't get away from him fast enough.
My third boyfriend was only 5 years older than me, but he was the worst of them all. He played me like a fool and left me feeling used and worthless.
I was so focused on my relationships that I neglected everything else in my life. I used to vape and smoke a lot, and it affected my studies. I did very badly for my O levels, only getting 39 points. It was a far cry from the 213 points I got for my PSLE. I was in Secondary 5 when I took my O levels, and everything went downhill from there.
I was a Chinese girl and I thought I was fairly good-looking, but it didn't seem to matter. I thought that love would be the answer to everything, but it only brought me pain and misery. I couldn't help but feel like my life was ruined. I felt like I had nothing left to live for.
I used to be such a hopeful and optimistic person, but after all that had happened to me, I couldn't see the point in anything anymore. I felt like I was just a shell of my former self, and I didn't know how to move on.
I couldn't help but blame myself for everything that had happened. I thought maybe if I had made different choices, things would have turned out differently. But it was too late for that now. I was stuck in a cycle of regret and self-loathing, and I didn't know how to break free from it.
I wish I had known then what I know now. I wish I had realized that love isn't always enough, and that you have to take care of yourself first and foremost. But it's too late for me now, and I'm left to pick up the pieces of my shattered life.

60289,106483,"Cny is coming and honestly although it’s supposed to be a festival where families gather together it’s very dreadful for me.
As compared to my older brother who is more cheerful, smart, popular and handsome. I am the exact opposite (quiet and awkward). So I grew up with my aunties comparing both my brother and I , with many criticisms directed at me.. not as handsome, not as smart, why so short. As my patents always told me that it’s important to maintain harmony I always put up with all these criticisms.
Last year before cny bro and I both got attached and his gf is a model so she’s really good looking in society standard. My gf on the other hand is more of the normal looking in society standards (ofc to me in my heart she’s the best and prettiest). As we just started dating last year I did not bring her back for cny.. (she felt that it was too soon), my bro on the other hand brought his gf back and got many praises .. Woww gf pretty, rich etc
This year I plan to bring my gf back but overheard one of my relative telling my mother : “eh this year your small son bringing gf back.. how is she like? Prettier than bigger son gf? I want to compare leh..”
As I grew up being compared to my elder bro, I know the feeling of being compared .. it’s really very hurtful and I do not want my gf to be subjected to that treatment . I know my gf will be very hurt as well .. As such I’m wondering in order to protect her should I just not bring her to cny this year as well?
any advice?
I really hate those relatives during cny.. it’s a festival meant for everyone to gather not gossip.

Always getting drunk with each other, but insist that they have never slept together before. I can't be sure because I find her rather attractive. He was helping her to move out from the school hall to her new place. That took almost a whole day and he slept over at her new place. That happened a year back when we just got together. I trust that it was purely to help out a friend without family here in SG. His bestfriend got attached recently too to a local guy. Four of us would hang out once in a while, most recently to USS. It all seems normal when we are out. Yesterday he asked if he could invite her to his family reunion dinner this year. Because she is not going home for CNY this year and he doesn't want her to be alone. I am thinking why wouldn't she go to her boyfriend's place instead? I am not sure how to react and how to feel.

60301,106518,"My mum is emotionally abusive. When I was younger, she used to make sarcastic remarks whenever I look into the mirror. From then on, I never dared to look into the mirror and felt like I was really ugly. I was fascinated when I started noticing that girls actually used or stared at the mirror in the toilet to doll themselves up. I felt ashamed whenever I look at myself in the mirror. Now I just take a quick glance to ensure there's no food stuck in my teeth.
When I showed her care and concern, such as asking what she wanted to eat, she will scream and shout at me outside. I felt so embarrassed.
I kept wondering what have I done. I started avoiding her and moved out. People around me, such as my previously boss, immediately said I should move back home and that I should be filial when I told him I've moved out.
She intentionally picks up fights at home, knocking on my door while I'm still asleep. She starts vacuum the floor when I am in virtual calls, or watches television really loudly when I'm focused on my work.
Wish there was someone to confide in. Inherently I want to be a filial daughter, help support her, take care of her. But the mental and emotional disturbance is too much, hence I moved out. But in places such as Singapore, moving out seems to be a taboo or a big deal.
Married couples shouldn't have children if they didn't plan for one. I feel unwanted. I wish I wasn't born. Please don't have children if you don't have the capacity to show love.

This guy I knew in sec school was the definition of stupid and lazy, didn't do homework, didn't do any studying, pulled his own weight in projects but that was it. Ended up not doing so well for O levels for my school's standards, and went to some obscure neighborhood JC. He was one of those people you either loved or hated and basically that was the class verdict on him, half of them liked him and half of us didn't at all.
So like obviously I don't think about him the next few years because I'm also in JC and then army and then Uni, so like I heard about him during army from a couple of my friends and it seemed that he didn't do well enough to make it into local uni. And yeah that was it for a long time.
Then today I meet a junior who tells me that his (my junior's) classmate is in the same... idk lab group? (sry marketing major, don't understand science organization) as this friend of mine. And apparently he graduated (somehow) from NUS with a FCH.
Is that even fair? How did he even get in? You all know how hard it is to get As in uni and this guy can get As reliably? If he was in marketing or arts or something that wasn't obviously so science I'd question it less but this is like... engineering and sciences. He wasn't even good at science and didn't even pass math.
He's not even from a branded JC leh, and you see all these branded JC kids finding it hard to get FCH then this guy casually can't even make it in JC and secondary but all of a sudden FCH. I don't get it lol it's not like he worked hard during uni.

For all the young adults who have similar type of parents. Your parents are adults too and have been adults far longer than us, if they don't contribute their fair share in the relationship emotionally, physically then it's time to cut them out. It's not our responsibility to make sure they can retire
It doesn't makes any sense that I work my ass off 9-5 + OT, contribute the fillial money($1.2k out of $4k), just to go home where my only interaction with my parents is being scolded for not doing enough chores when I have always done my fair share. Even worse is scolded by a fulltime housewife... who do a max 3hours of chores a day then slack off for the rest of the day finishing a TV series every two to three days. I even confronted them about their behavior but they wouldn't listen with the entitled snobbish attitudes. It was too ridiculous for me..so I left immediately when I got married and got my HDB and never paid or contacted them ever again.
So much happier now.

60298,106507,"CNY is supposed to be a time for people to enjoy the company of family. That’s how it has always been marketed.
But in reality, CNY is an excuse for older Chinese people to exert their control on younger generations by forcing traditional practices onto them as if it is materially advantageous for anyone to continue them.
I celebrate Christmas in my family with my siblings. It is spontaneous, it is elective, and at the end of the day my siblings are happy, I am happy, because we did it in the spirit of family.
CNY practices take the family spirit completely out of the picture by burying it under an ungodly amount of ceremony that every single CNY that I remember comprised of my parents fighting with their siblings and parents because they can never agree on the right amount of tradition, and cousins from completely different walks of life who meet once a year suddenly being forced to mingle, and everyone making random shouting noises as if what we really need after a year of slogging is more noise and ruckus.

I graduated in 2021 and 5months into my first job, l was informed that i did not pass probation. Lack of initiatives and making repeated mistakes were the main reasons why i was let go. Instead of citing that i failed probation, my manager allowed me to tender resignation so it doesn’t look like i was let go due to incompetency (I am not sure if this helps for future job applications). I was really demoralised and i felt so incompetent as the job itself wasn’t difficult since it was mainly adminstrative duties. I questioned my capabilities and if I’m suitable for any corporate jobs out there. So for the past year, I struggled with getting a permenant role and I don’t feel “ready” to start a full time role so I have been doing short term contract in different industries. What I did was mass apply and accepting any offer that comes first.
As I am reflecting on my job history, I realised that i have learned nothing for the past 2 years. I don’t like my current job and my contract is ending in may, I am thinking of applying back to my first job industry.
Can anyone advise me on my career path and are there any chances of me getting a second chance in the industry that i failed probation in? Does the HR knows that i failed probation or it would be seen as a resignation from their side?
Also, how can i be a more responsible and professional employee?
TIA for all the career advice!

I am not who I used to be.
When I was in JC, I was the only one in class who had a boyfriend. Nobody else in class had boyfriends, everyone else was focused on studying.
From the age of 16-19 (ie before university), I was healthy and happy. I used to be super into romance novels and movies, I think I saw about 20 per year? And I used to (yeah past tense) cry a lot at the sad and touching parts where the rest of my jc mates felt absolutely nothing. I was the only one who shed so much tears at romantic films and even songs.
In that time, I was the only A in class for a lot of subjects. I was the top few in my jc class for A levels.
Then, my life took a sharp turn and I could barely recognise myself. Throughout University and even work, I NEVER had a boyfriend any more. I lost complete interest. My jc mates who never had a crush on anyone found boyfriends in University, while I was left single.
every time friends gathered to discuss their “targets”, I’d be sitting there with a BLANK LOOK. I suddenly realised that I have not had a crush on ANYONE in years and I forgot what the feeling was.
I’d still go for outings and gatherings with everyone but just as friends, I can’t pinpoint a single person to “love”. This lost feeling followed me until graduation and into work.
One by one, my jc friends who previously never had boyfriends all got married. Even the one who never had a crush from jc all the way until University, met her Prince Charming at work and married young. The introverted one who only talked to a few girls found her husband in church. The one who aspired to be a nun since 17, is now married to a long term boyfriend she met at University.
I watched as their tears flowed down at their weddings, while I sat there dry eyed each time, thinking”this used to be me. Why can’t I feel anything now?” After age 20, my tears of being touched suddenly stopped flowing, the feels stopped coming, and I never was interested in a single romance movie.
Without the ability to love, My grades went all the way down, and I barely scraped past the honours. No more A for any module.
Youth is so beautiful. I miss being young. How did these friends suddenly go from asexual and aromantic to happily married? Are they truly in love or did they just pick someone who loves them without them loving the other party back?
What’s going on?
