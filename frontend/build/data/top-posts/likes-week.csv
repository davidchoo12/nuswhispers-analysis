61198,108391,"I have a similar experience to the artist cousin in #108338.
I trained as an electrical engineer. Worked for a few years in the semiconductor industry. I hated every moment of my degree, I hated every moment of my work. I was good at math and physics in JC and EE was just an obvious choice. I also came from a humble background so money was a consideration. I made the transition to software, hated it less but I still loathed the work. 
Few years ago, I decided to quit everything and started my own indoor farm. I am excited to go to work everything and it is a feeling I hope most of you reading will feel at least for a few years in your life. I don’t want to go into specifics but we raised $5M last year. Because of the type of crops we chose, and clever decisions we made by focusing on produce and not so much on automation/tech, we make very good money out of this. We are profitable, which is very rare for high tech farms. 
I wouldn’t go back to EE or SWE even if you doubled my current income. I now generate more than double in profit than my last drawn income working for a FAANG company. The only difference, as far as I can tell, is my passion for watching my plants grow. 
The other reason why following your interests, provided you’re not evidently bad at it, is because you can keep at it for far longer. Time is needed to get good. But if you hate what you do, it’s really hard to convince yourself to want to become good at something. Passion is needed to really dig deep into any subject.
If you are like me, i.e you’re naturally good at something you really hate, then you need to decide whether it is ultimately worth it to keep doing it for the money or whether you need to find a different path. I don’t think it is very common for people to be good at what they hate although I have met a few.

I dont know why my younger colleagues prefer hybrid and WFH. I have friends in the office and i enjoy lunch, chats and coming in. Even before this, i always came in 5days a week. I dont take any MC. My colleagues say i spoil market and dont want to adapt to new way of working. They say i shud at least try once a week at home. I dont get whats so tough in coming to office. Can all this younger ppl enlighten me?

61200,108377,"Is it mandatory to pay for wedding guest accommodation and flight tickets?
I half chinese/filipino PR 24F, and my Indonesian chinese singaporean fiance 27M are deciding whether to get married in SG or Philippines as we have about 200 pax guest to cover.
In SG for that amount of guests, wedding costs would go up to 50k or more.
But in Philippines would be less than 20k.
50-60 out of the 200 guest are from my fiance side + friends and the rest (150+) resides in php. Which means having a wedding in php would be more convenient.
But I’ve heard from some of my friends that if we were to invite them to an overseas wedding, we should be responsible for their flight as well as accommodation costs too.
And a rountrip ticket to php would be about $300 each. So overall $15k+ for 50pax which is almost the wedding cost at php???? Is there an option to buy in bulk and how much cheaper would it be? 
Also is it a must to pay for their tickets as well as accommodations?
Or does anyone know how we can do a 20k wedding in sg for about 100pax at least?

61201,108380,"I'm currently on a 2 yr contract with an MNC that is ending in late Feb, upon which I will get a 1 mth completion bonus. However, as per the T&C of my contract,  I am able to tender my resignation by serving one month notice any time within the contract period.
I recently started job hunting and have received a verbal offer (pending official letter) from another company. It's a full time position. However the company has indicated that due to some upcoming project they would not be able to wait till Mar for me to fulfil my contract at my current company before joining them. They have asked if I am able to do a 1 month notice, as per my contract T&C.
Now, my dilemma is due to the close time frame. Out of obligation I do want to finish the contract but the new company needs me to join in Feb and cannot wait. If I were to resign before my contract is up, I would also lose the completion bonus. I'm concerned I'll be seen as burning bridges or unprofessional, as I would be leaving in the middle of an important project. Plus, it's just the last leg of my contract. In an ideal situation I would prefer to finish the contract then join the new Co but unfortunately they cannot wait.
For context, the new job is offering slightly higher than what I'm drawing now. Leave, bonus and benefits are typical, nothing to rave about. However it is a permanent position and there seems to be room for learning and career growth.
Will you choose to forgo the offer since the time isn't right and just go back to job hunting or break the contract at this awkward juncture and risk burning bridge.

61202,108392,"Hi Prof Ben, i need your advice as to what do you think of open marriages and if this is considered a disgraceful matter? As most people would suggest why not divorce instead? 
My husband and i are married for 9 years without children, and we are having sexual incompatibility in our marriage despite trying to work it out for the past 5 years. We still love each other, but at certain point we realized there are some incompatibility when it comes to physical touch. This may sound like a joke, but it is a real issue in marriages that is often not discussed and made fun of.

61199,108395,"With all due respect to OP of #108332 decades of experience in the engineering industry, I have to respectfully point out multiple flaws in his/her arguments lest undergrads reading that post get misled. As a NUS CS grad myself, I have a duty to rigorously defend my cohort.
While OP may be factually correct to say EE people can apply to CS jobs, this does not paint the full picture in practice. In my admittedly not so many decades of experience as a tech lead, most EE freshers I have interviewed do not code well to the standard required for most SWE roles. I checked out the EE syllabus and observe that the EE degree alone does not adequately prepare one to do an SWE role properly unless the graduate picks up additional skills on his own free time which I seen many do not do.
It's a fact that recent CS grads are top A-level scorers compared to EEs. Couple dumping ground A-levels with a largely irrelevant degree, it is no brainer that most EE graduates are also outclassed by low-tier CS graduates for SWE roles. With slight slowdown and layoffs in the tech industry, average EE freshers can simply forget about decent SWE jobs. With more CS grads in the job market, why should I bother to waste time looking at non-CS freshers?
OP claims that a CS graduate can never venture into EE roles. That is completely bogus and an unfair accusation into the learning capabilities of CS grads. A degree is a starting point of one's learning journey and it's incorrect to say that that all CS grads can do is be an SWE. There are plenty of online courses today where one can pick up skills after graduation. One is no longer limited to a university for learning.
Wasn't there a post not too long ago of a CS graduate who switched to embedded systems? This fact is a counterexample to OP's claim that electronics jobs are only accessible to EE grads. If a CS grad is crazily stupid enough, they can surely go for EE jobs too.
Suppose that a CS grad cannot work in electronics, PCB layout, ASIC, RF, optics, high-power systems, it is irrelevant as the EE industry in SG has all indications of being a sunset industry. This industry has passed its peak period, EE industry has shrunken due to jobs shifted to lower-cost areas, EE starting salaries have remained stagnant for years. How often do you see people taking up courses to career-switch into the electronics industry? More often than not, it is people from engineering that are switching to tech careers like data science and machine learning.
The CS degree is no less versatile than an EE degree and there are many roles in semicon, healthcare, energy, finance, robotics etc that value CS grads and even pay them more than the native engineers in those fields too.
Assuming OP's 33 years of industry experience is true, I am sorely disappointed. I expected him/her to give better advice to undergraduates than peddling outdated information and basking in his/her former glory of EE superiority.

61203,108393,"Tldr: should i be concerned about my liquid diet?
(admins don’t block plsssss)
Ever since enrolling in NUS, i have gradually moved away from regular (solid) meals to a diet of mostly tea, coffee, milk and/or soft drinks.
I did that because whenever I have a heavy lunch/dinner, there will be a blood sugar spike and my brain will “fog” up for 2-3 hours, and I’m unable to concentrate in class and/or for my assignments. And it put my grades at risk.
However I found out that if I skipped those meals and just rely on drinks, I could continue studying for hours without feeling tired (and can absorb easily what I’m learning). 
I suspect this has to do with a more constant blood sugar level, even though I’ve not tested it. 
(Could be related to dopamine levels as well; I’m essentially coupling a more enjoyable/spontaneous activity with one that’s less)
After several semesters I’m used to this routine (especially when there are more assignments or nearing exams).  I can sit in UTown from like morning to evening, with 1-2 bottles of drinks by my side, and actually quite productively finish most of the work before I leave.
However many of my friends often pass by UTown and see me like this. (I’m still somewhat sensitive to their comments, and no I can’t study at home, and I can’t drink in libraries).  Some even made fun of my large appetite for drinks; others patiently counseled me that this can put me at risk of diabetes and other complications, which I might live to regret.
I have indeed become quite dependent on sugar-based drinks, and without them it is very difficult to maintain my focus and productivity. (Though I hope I would no longer be so reliant after graduation). 
However I have mostly maintained a healthy weight, eating 1-2 meals a day (usually only after I’m done with work or if they are less brain-intensive).
How worried should I be/ not be about this situation?
I feel like I finally found a “hack” to maintain good grades for my situation, and I don’t want to let go of it if I suddenly cut away sugar this semester!

61195,108378,"I am an incoming PhD student (Environmental Engineering), starting in Jan 2024. As part of my PhD I want to explore the applications of AI and Machine learning in the field of Environment and sustainability. As such I am interested in taking CEG5301 - Machine Learning with Applications next Sem, to fully understand the types of machine learning algorithms that exist and their various applications, to be able to identify potential applications in my field of study.  
Specifically, I want to know how much coding experience, and in what programming language, is required to take the module. Currently I have about 2 years coding experience using the language R, and I have used Machine Learning Regression in my research in R, previously, including in a peer reviewed paper that was published. I can use R quite comfortably, but it is the only programming language I know. 
What I want to know is, from people who have done this module before, can this module be done using R?

61196,108374,"Underinsured for insurance? Looking for investing options for midterm too.(3-5 years)
I have just started working in my current company since May. It has a group term life, group personal accident, hospitalisation insurance coverage for all full time employees that you can choose how much to cover from 12x to 48x of your monthly salary. With me being cheapskate and wanting to claim more on flexible benefits, I opted to downgrade from the default 24x monthly salary to 12x monthly salary coverage for term life insurance so that I can get an additional $200+ in flexible benefits that I can claim for items such as dental treatment, spectacles, medical checkup etc. I am thinking if I should continue like this for the next year and so on.
Currently I am paying $500++ in total yearly for a Great Eastern term life and hospitalisation insurance covering death, total and permanent disability, hospitalisation and surgical coverage. I am in the lookout for something that is much cheaper that I am currently paying right now as the term insurance has a coverage of $200k but I am thinking to downgrade to something cheaper like FWD insurance which has a term life policy of paying $13.70 for $100k coverage till 70. Funny thing is right I can afford to have a higher coverage with my current pay but I don't want to increase my coverage and want to stick to what I am having now. Probably because my father used to tell me that insurance is a waste of money so that idea stuck with me till now ?
My current take home pay is ~$3700 after CPF deduction, after giving my parents $1000 allowance I would invest $2000 into a ETF that I am investing for long term. In addition I would also park $1000 into various 6 months and 1 year T-bills and fixed deposits so I am looking at something that can cover me for the next 3-5 years.
