61007,108024,"Hi everyone I'm the OP of #108021. 
Thanks for all the comments, what I didn't mention was:
I'm overweight because I build muscles.
I'm not drawing a salary because I have my own company and pay myself dividends.
I don't have a car because Grab is convenient and cars are a depreciating asset. 
I don't have a HDB because I have a condo. 
I'm in debt of over 500k because of my mortgage.
I don't have a wife yet because I'm only getting married next year.
I don't go out much and spend all my time on the computer because I'm working everyday.
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

60999,107996,"All this talk about who pays on first dates... Aiya, here's a summarized guide to end this discourse once and for all.
Regardless of who invites who,
Scenario A: The guy offers to pay for both.
- If the girl doesn't offer and insist to pay for herself, then you know you dodged a bullet.
- If the girl allows you to pay but doesn't treat you on a second date, or worse still, knowing that she doesn't want to see you again, she still allows you to pay, then you know you dodged a huge bullet.
- If the girl allows you to pay, thanks you, and tells you she would treat you on a second date and backs it up with actions, she's a keeper, don't let her go.
Scenario B: Both people pays for their own part.
- If the girl looks and shows signs of displeasure or disinterest right after this happens, you know she's expecting you to pay from the start. Bullet dodged, don't ask her out again.
- If not, and if the girl follows up with an activity to do or a place to check out, then it's alright, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad either.
Scenario C: The girl offers to pay for both.
- If this happens, as a decent human being, offer to pay for yourself, and insist on it. If she insists to pay for you, make sure to pay for the second date. You got a keeper, don't let her go.
- If you let her pay without offering, then bro what you doing, you can do better. Not surprising if she doesn't want to see you again after.
Flip the genders around for all scenarios, it applies regardless. No double standards.
Best way to handle things? Each person pays for themselves on the date, with no expectations to have a free treat whatsoever. If you want to impress the girl/guy by paying for them, then go ahead, but risk potentially getting taken advantaged of for a free meal, and your precious time and energy especially if you ask them out again.
At the end of the day, if the girl/guy likes you for who you are, there wouldn't even be an expectation for you to pay for their meal, regardless of how cheap or expensive the meal is, or whoever invited who.
Would you be happy going on dates with self-entitled girls who expect you to pay for them? There're better girls out there! (or guy if you're a girl and like guys) :p

61002,108000,"Why do children have to suffer when it’s the parent who married the wrong person? Why can’t I have my own life and my own happy family? Why can’t I get married without feeling guilty?
My mom has been dropping the bomb every now and then saying things like she will be alone in future after my siblings and I get married, nobody to care for her etc, while not putting in any effort in her own marriage. I have been her part time husband since young, accompanying her everywhere in the absence of my dad, and I grew up wondering WHY do children have to be the ones who suffer when it’s the parents marriage that failed. And it’s not even like my parents are divorced, they are just not putting in any effort to even communicate properly with each other. It’s frustrating. My siblings and I even have to be the ones passing messages between them at times. Cant they just talk properly???
Why is it that you don’t have a happy marriage and you want to stop us from having ours? Cant you let us get married without feeling guilty for being unable to spend as much time with you? Why???? Why would people be unhappy and choose to pass on that unhappiness to their loved ones?
Am I wrong for feeling this way? I am sure I won’t be a parent who wants my children to be unhappy if I am unhappy so I don’t understand why would my parents be like that?

61008,108019,"A very controversial question but, a genuine one really. This is really sensitive but, it's just my own views and I'd like to see different thoughts. 
Okay, so, you know those cancer patients that need to shave their head? It's unfortunate and I do feel sad for them. But, I saw bunch of videos where the patient's friends or family also shave their own heads in order to support or make them feel like they are not alone. 
I know for most people, it's heartwarming, and I can see it in that angle. But... On my angle, those healthy people who shave their own heads to show support, don't really do it for support of the cancer patient, rather, it's all for clout of the internet. Cause if they're genuine, why record it for the world to see? Just shave your own head in private and surprise them in private, and if people notice in public, great. But why bother posting it on the internet? All for clout in my opinion. 
Another thing, even more controversial claim to support my statement that they do it for clout, I find the whole healthy people shaving their head for cancer patients to be.... Really attention seeking. In the end, their hair will grow back and that's why they do it easily, since they have nothing to worry about. 
I mean, let's replace cancer patients with accident patients that lost one of their arm. I don't see anyone from their friends or family chopping their arm off to show support now do they? Yup, 100% for clout. In my opinion, just be there for the patient is enough. No need to do all these extra things and especially to put it up on the internet for clout. 
This is just my view, I know it's controversial. But, you're welcome to change my mind on how to view things differently.

61004,108003,"38 year old PMET here. Did ok in life. Worked a corporate job but have not much to tie me down here besides family. 
All the euphoria about the rising property prices in Singapore has to be a top signal. Property prices are falling and mortgage rates are rising globally and somehow, we believe that SG is this invincible bubble? 
 
Something I don't have the balls and bandwidth to do (yet):
1. Find citizenship elsewhere.
2. Withdraw my CPF.
3. Short the Singapore stock market with the proceeds.
There is no future for me here. This is a country for those born with a golden (silver aint enough) spoon in their mouths.
Looking at our birth rates and unfavourable costs of raising children, we won't even have the young populace to support the tax burden of maintaining all our healthcare needs in the long run. Our shiny MRTs and other public amenities aren't cheap to maintain either.
There's plenty that needs changing before I can believe this is a country which looks out for the future of its younger adults as opposed to maintaining the net worth of the rent-seeking older ones.
This country behaves like there is a perpetual motion machine to prop all this up. I am not that optimistic.

61003,108001,"Anything ya'll can help me with on this current situation that I'm having? I actually met a guy 2021 November two years ago, and he was really nice, we hit it off pretty quick, and eventually asked for it, but not after I told him we should date first and he should become by boyfriend. He then agreed and we dated and then two months later, did it. But two weeks after he did it with me, he immediately started distancing me and became uncontactable. He finally was contactable one week after that and he said he was getting a gf. I was stunned. Maybe I didn't know him well enough. But he broke up with her one year after that and I continued talking to him to know him better. However, six months ago, he eventually got a new gf again without telling me. I found out from a source. I was still remembering six months ago if he was talking or friendly with any girls and he said no. What may I do in this current situation? He lied to my face. And told someone else a different story. Now this has come to a point that it is affected my functioning because it was actually the first time with a guy, and he took my virginity. Now it's affecting my functioning abilities and I'm having really bad thoughts and Idk why this is happening to me and always am thinking to self-destructing or negative thoughts in general. I can't look past why he did this to me or why this type of people exist in general, though they are all around us and worse of all why did it happen it me? Pls help me on this. Any advice is greatly appreciated.????

61001,107999,"How can an ugly person cope with loneliness? I realised that even if one day I become rich or something there still won’t be anyone that love me for me. And even though I have an extrovert personality, treat everyone nicely and never said no to anyone asking for help, I still have no friends, let alone romantic encounters. I become super depressed and angry every time I see people posting their holidays, they’re couple pictures and friendship gatherings. After inspecting every aspect of my life the only reason I could blame is that I am ugly, even if I try my best to dress properly. What should I do? I really can’t handle this anymore.

61006,108023,"I recently spoke to the shop staff at the chicken rice stall in Pasir Ris Drive 6, and it's disheartening to hear about the challenges they're facing. The cost of living in our area has skyrocketed, forcing the chicken rice stall owner to make the difficult decision to close down the business. It's a testament to the tough times many small businesses are enduring.
The shop was dealing with a rental cost of a staggering 14K, an additional 2K for a dishwasher, and a 20% profit cut for each item sold at the stall. This seemed incredibly unfair and unsustainable, almost like daylight robbery for a small business owner trying to make ends meet.
On top of these challenges, when the coffee shop decided to renovate, the stall owner had to shoulder a certain percentage of the renovation costs, adding further strain.
In the midst of this adversity, Coffee shop has stepped up to continue the business. They've made adjustments by retaining the staff and shortening business hours, displaying resilience and adaptability in a tough market.

60997,107994,"Responding to #107971
I totally agree with your opinions. Seems like the top people like to blow hot air, advocating flexible work arrangements, outcome based jobs and hot desking, only to eat their own words by going backwards on the flexible work arrangements.
Best thing is barely 1 week after the HR announcement was circulated, the bus people also sent email circular telling staff to avoid taking internal shuttle buses during super peak hours. Next thing you know canteen people  may start telling staff to avoid buying or eating food at canteens during super peak hours that coincide with staff lunch hours. And I've also heard there is a clear and distinct lack of office spaces for some Departments.
C'mon la top people. Please rethink your strategies about having more staff coming back on more days and yet resources/facilities are not able to keep up with demands.
