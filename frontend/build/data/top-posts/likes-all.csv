44460,71670,"Today, I felt my heart properly break for the first time. The course I’m studying has quite a heavy workload so I haven’t been going home for the past three weeks. My father came to visit me today. He is rarely ever free and today is one of those days that he could make time.
My father is close to 70 years old and he is still not retired. He works as a cleaner at a country club during the day and holds another cleaning job at the community centre near my house at night. For some reason, he had half a day off today and he said he wanted to tour my hall. He came over and after showing him my room, we decided to get dinner at the Kopitiam at Kent Ridge MRT.
I know my father doesn’t have money so I offered to pay for his dinner. Guess what? The silly man ordered the cheapest thing he could find - fishball noodles. There was a lady (very well dressed, looks to be at least middle-class) infront of us in the queue and she left her chilli on the counter then walked away somewhere. My father didn’t see it and thought that that was an extra sauce so he just took it and put in on our tray. When the lady returned, she said very sarcastically that someone took her chilli while glancing up and down at my father. He immediately apologised and explained to her that we were not aware and that she could have her chilli back but she replied “你动过的我才不要。肮脏死”, which loosely translates into “I don’t want what you’ve touched. You’re dirty to death”.
This was when I realised that my father was still in his uniform. I almost screamed at this lady seeing as she was clearly younger than my father and was being rude. However, my father held me back and simply apologised again. He said that he’s used to it and it suddenly hit me that this is what he does all on a day to day basis. He apologises and lets people walk over him. He is invisible. I always knew my dad worked hard and is always at the mercy of others but seeing it with my own two eyes was an entirely different experience. I couldn’t even hold back my emotions and start tearing uncontrollably while we were eating. I had to lie that I was tearing because I got chilli in my eye but the truth is I was heartbroken by how my dad has to swallow his pride all the time.
I can’t wait for the day when I can tell him to stop working and stop apologising for everything. All my dad ever did was love and dote on me but everyone else has just been so awful to him. Dear rich people, what did we ever do wrong to you?

43425,69443,"Amidst all the troll, relationship and faith-in-human lost confessions here, I'd like to share something positive, and hopefully encouraging. I just graduated from NUS this year, but it's only now that I feel ready to share my story.
I grew up in a single-parent family with my mom and little sister. Throughout primary school, I was doing decently well in school and my CCAs. We weren't rich, but we survived just fine as a family.
Everything changed during secondary school when my mom was first diagnosed with cancer. When I first heard the news, all I could think of was 'why me?'. It felt like god was being unfair towards me. I was not a saint, but I did my best to live my life honestly and did everything as right as I could. Yet, this had to happen to me. From then on, my life started to go downhill. I started skipping school, my grades suffered, mixed around with the wrong company, and committed petty crimes.
My mom had no idea all these were happening because half the time, she was in the hospital and my teachers avoid bothering her with these news because they do not want her to experience additional stress. But finally, I was arrested by the police for shoplifting. I could never forget the look on her face when I saw her while she was bailing me out. Beneath the wrinkles, paleness and tiredness on her face, her disappointment was apparent. She was weak, in a wheelchair and was supposed to go for her usual check up that day. But she missed it because of me.
I realised that I was being selfish the whole time. I realised that I was thinking about myself and my own suffering, without realising that my mom was the one who was suffering the most. Additionally, my sister was starting to be influenced by me because her teacher called me and informed me that she had skipped school without an MC or letter.
I soon picked myself up, took my N levels, and scored well enough to take the O levels. My mom's condition started to get better as well. I stopped hanging out with bad company, and my teachers helped by giving me tuition in their free time.
I took my O levels. I had the goal of going to a good JC. But it was my second last O level paper, when one of my teacher approached me after the end of the paper. She told me the news. That my mom had passed away while I was taking the exam. My whole came crashing down again.
With that news, I could not focus on my last paper the next day. I did not score well enough to go to the JC I wanted, and ended up going to Poly. My life, once again, went downhill. It felt pointless to keep trying. It felt like I tried my best to be good, yet life just was not fair towards me. And with my mom gone, I did not have the motivation to study anymore.
While waiting for the Poly semester to start, I went through one of my darkest period. I was contemplating death every single day. There were some nights when I was very close to going through with my suicide plan.
What got me out of it was during one of those suicidal nights, I entered my sister's bedroom to put a note on her desk. She did not hear not hear me coming in, and I heard what sounded like crying noise. You see, my sister never cried or showed much emotions. During my mom's funeral, there was no expression on her face. But that day, hearing her cry, I realised that she was hurting just as much as I am. And if I were to die, the pain I experienced would not just end with me. It's be transferred to my sister, and that was the most selfish thing I could do.
I started to have a new motivation in live. My sister. I pulled through poly, juggling with a part-time banquet job during the weekends. And just like that, I made it through poly, and into university because of my good grades.
We had some help from our relatives, but it was never enough for us. My sister needed school supplies, and I needed textbooks and to pay off my poly tuition fee. My social life was not the best, because I could not keep up with going out with the clique every week and spending money with them when they choose to eat pricier food. Fortunately, I made a few good friends who understood my situation. They always opt for budget options, or insisted on paying for me. One of them had a sibling who was studying in the same secondary school as my sister and was a year older, and he gave me his sibling's old textbooks, supplies and even school uniform.
There were times when I felt like I was going downhill again, but when I looked back at how far I came, I find the courage to continue on. From someone who was arrested for shoplifting, to someone studying at NUS.
This year, I finally graduated. I was not the best in my cohort, with only a second-lower class, but it meant a lot that I graduated.
On my graduation day, I did not attend the ceremony. Instead, I went to the place where my mom's urn was kept, in my graduation gown (I didn't care that people were staring), and stayed there while the ceremony was going on. That day was the closest I've ever felt to my mom. She always told me her biggest regret in life was not getting an education and did not want her children to meet with the same regret. I hope that wherever she is, she'd be proud.
Someday, I hope to go back to school and get a masters or phd. But for now, the best option is to find work first, because I want my sister to go through life a little more comfortably than I did. But someday, I'll make my mom even prouder.

3808,5308,"I live in a one room flat above a shophouse in the geylang area alone with my mum. (Just imagine a living room sized room with a kitchen attached and a toilet). We don't have beds nor pillows, just two mattresses with clothes stacked up at the foot of the mattress. I've been wearing the same set of formal clothes for presentation throughout my 4 years here.
My mum works tirelessly for more than 12 hours everyday 7 days a week selling fishball noodles in her stall nearby. She has been doing this alone since I was 12 as my dad left around then due to large gambling debts. Both my mother and I just came home one day and never saw him return. She is the sole family member I know (as for the rest of my relatives I am not remotely close to, they look down on my mum for having a gambler husband).
Despite this, she still managed to put me through jc and uni, although we did manage with bursaries and scrimping and saving where ever and whenever we can. I'm 23 and yet to have sat on an airplane or travelled further than Malaysia.
Every holiday period and almost every weekend, I will head down to help her tend her stall, usually helping with the money side or rolling fishballs. 90% of my friends do not know this side of my life and those that do always comment that I have a hard life balancing studies and helping my mum. They don't understand but my mum has it way harder than me.
Recently during graduation, my mum took her first off day in years just to come down to nus to watch me graduate. Even though she didn't understand a word of the speeches or what I have been doing these 4 years, the smile on her face is something I won't forget for many years to come. With first class honours I'm really thankful to say it wasn't difficult to land a job (CAP matters guys) and my mum can finally retire in a few months time. I can't wait for the day where I can drive her around or buy her a proper bed where she can sleep in an airconditioned room.
Ma, this one's for you.

8275,12175,"I was 7. Kneeling in front of the altar. Pa had caned and punished me again for stealing money from his coin wallet. I hated him.
I was 11. Pa had just bought me a new 2-wheel bicycle 3 months earlier as it was my birthday. Being the reckless, fearless kid that I was, I cycled around void decks, venturing out to pedestrian sidewalks, car parks, cycling across roads. Pa was mad when he found out, he removed both wheels as punishment. I hated him.
I was 15. My voice had just started to crack. Pa asked me, ""Why is your voice like that? Can you stop talking like a sissy?"" Pa. My voice had never changed, it's breaking and I can't control it sometimes. I felt so ashamed of myself I always forced my voice into something deep even though it strained me so much. I hated him.
I was 16. I received my O level results and I did well enough to enter most polytechnic courses and most JC's except for the top 4 or 5. Pa insisted that I went to poly, away from my friends who mostly went to JC. He separated us. I hated him.
I was 19. I had done well enough to enter the local Universities. Pa said he never understood what the point of studying so much was, that I should just start working. We were not rich enough to comfortably afford University, but not poor enough to qualify for financial assistance, just like many other families out there. He didn't want to have to take a loan. I didn't want to stop studying just yet. I hated him.
I was 20. I enlisted and worked really hard, eventually getting into OCS. In addition to having weekdays burnt already, sometimes weekends got burnt too. I saw less of Pa, and we never really talked even on Sundays when we met. My aim in entering OCS was clear: To save as much as I could in order to fund my own University education.
I was 22. I hadn't saved enough to fully fund my University fees, but I told myself that I would give tuition to make up the difference. I had applied and got into NUS before I ORD-ed. I felt a small sense of pride in achieving what I had so far. I thought nothing of Pa. I had grown up hating him over issues small and big, and that resentment stayed.
I was 25. I graduated. Pa and Ma attended convocation. They couldn't have been prouder of me. Pa had worn a proper shirt and tie, with pants. It was probably the first time I had seen him in this attire since I was born, from photographs of their wedding.
I am 30. Pa had passed on due to stomach cancer, late detection. In his parting gift to me was a short letter and a sum of money. His English and Chinese wasn't good, growing up with a mixture of dialects and Mandarin, but he wrote it in English anyway.
""_______, all my life I dont know how to be good father. Sometimes I correct, sometimes I wrong. When you younger, I only want you to faster work so I can rest early. When you pass your uni is my best moment of my life. I look at you and I think that
""真的長大了
翅膀硬了會自己飛
也不是壞事"".
This money I work very hard when you in NS. I want give you to go uni but you go work. This money you keep for you. Sorry I never love you when you younger.
Love, 爸""
This was attached with around $18,000 in cash. The envelope was passed to me by Ma shortly after Pa died. As I recollect, I was a real asshole.
He punished me for stealing money. Stealing IS wrong.
Cycling around on the roads is dangerous.
I was selfish for wanting to study in University when my family finances were so. If I hadn't entered command school of any sort, I would be struggling so badly.
Despite his crude preference for me to start working early, he had been working hard during my NS period to raise money for me. $18k isn't enough, but that's besides the main pont....
Damn it. He was a good father. And I was the asshole son.
Pa I love you. And I'm sorry that I only saw all these so late in my life, only after you're gone that I appreciate what you went through. Rest assured that I will take care of Ma.

59741,105341,"I would like to share my eye opening experiences for the last six months working as a casual worker and the state of how said group of labourers are perceived.
Background info: I come from a privileged background and work for my family business for the last ten years or so after graduation. I haven't been exposed to much hardship with the exception of National Service and a bit of racism in my studies abroad. About 9 months ago, I had a major tiff with my family regarding the direction of our business and we decided that it would be better for me to take time off to collect myself and find my way. It was fun at first to bum around but it got boring quickly.
I read quite a bit and was awed by Einstein's experience as a patent clerk giving him new perspectives and decided to do something similar. I decided to take on any form of casual jobs for half a year with little to no commitment (so I can have the largest possible variety) - my shortest stint was one day and my longest was two weeks.
I gave myself a couple of rules to follow - no using of my car, limiting my spending to 20% of my daily wage, and not to quit no matter bad or tough the job was.
I found these jobs on FaceBook - a cornancopia of opportunities in various casual job groups.
I have worked as a food delivery rider, parcel delivery staff, pet transporter, mover, flyer distributor, general cleaner, IT crew, fishmonger, metalwork crew, AV crew, F&B staff, bar hand, food packer, warehouse operator, aeroplane cleaner, valet driver, durian opener, and a few more jobs.
It has been an eye opening experience working. The main things I noticed is that a good percentage of locals adopt an elitist mentality. Unfortunately, my family is guilty of this and to some extent, I too was. Most are very judgemental of blue collared workers and this is very prevalent in the F&B industry.
Toughest job: Metalwork crew. I had to cut metal objects to salvage profitable parts and it was extremely dangerous with sparks flying and a very dirty environment.
Most enjoyable job: Fishmonger. This was by far one of the most fun I had working as I learned to scale and cut different types of fish. It was also very interesting to work at the fisheries to see all sorts of fish(small ones to huge ones almost half a tonne).
Most interesting job: Valet driver, I witnessed plenty of older married men needing to be sent home/hotels with much younger women. Some of the dross these men say/do with their women in the car have definitely left a mark on me.
Most boring job: Warehouse operator, pretty mundane with too much repetition.
My experience as a bar hand watching guys trying to impress their dates is quite hilarious - I notice guys love to flaunt their wealth when it isn't really great in the grand scheme of things. They tend to treat the bar hands and service staff like crap to look more alpha I'm guessing? Terrible viewing.
Other 'interesting' experience include deliverying parcels to women who receive them not wearing underwear and being pretty nonchalant about it.
Distributing flyers/assisting and moving furniture from showflats to showflats for realtors was a jaded affair - I notice they tend to spew a lot of drivel to the prospective clients with little to no real knowledge about investments as a whole and only seem to care about making a quick buck. Males tend to be nicer to us, offering to buy food if we had worked the whole day without breaks. Females tend to be a bit more picky about not wasting flyers on seemingly unqualified prospects - very judgemental.
Working as an IT crew for tuition centres was pretty sad - I realised a lot of tutors are not really proficient and pretty much reading off their notes. I even noticed a few making mistakes in their lessons - quite alarming.
Cleaning flats and offices was.. peculiar. Some flats were really disgusting and I could not believe people are capable of being so gross and not able to pick up after themselves. Especially tenants moving out, woah. Some flat owners were really nice with isotonic drinks and snacks but the office ones were generally curt and snobbish. A typical HR who was in charge of us(usually middle age woman) would treat us as lesser beings and treat us as such.
Generally, people are quite condescending about lower waged workers and I even saw a few former JC mates brushing me off or being unnecessarily difficult in my experience in F&B. Thankfully, with the mandatory mask, I was never once recognised or questioned. I hope we will be a bit more gracious to people of all sorts of life - no one deserves to be belittled.
Transporting pets was truly amazing, I learned so much how the shelters are in need of help and how these animals truly need our help.
Overall, I made about $12000(close to $10/hour) in these six months and after my daily food and transportation expenses I had about $9000. I have donated this amount to the few shelters and will continue to do so.
I have learned so much for these six months that will echo for the rest of my life and have realigned my perspectives of how I should look at people and my family's firm.
A good two weeks break to decompress and time to get back to bringing our business forward and being a positive member of society.
AMA and I will do my best to reply in a follow-up post.
Always choose to be kind and gracious, it costs nothing.

54176,92481,"Today, my colleague confessed to me that she likes me. Together with three other colleagues, we had dinner at one of our colleagues’ house. After dinner, the five of us had some wine and chatted for hours. I then offered to send her home because she was slightly drunk and other colleagues stay too far away from her.
During the taxi ride to her house, she started laughing uncontrollably and then sobbing. She then suddenly confessed her feelings for me. I was taken aback but I tried to remain calm and explain to her that I have a girlfriend. She said she knows I have a girlfriend and she has seen her photo on my social media. She then asked me what I saw in my girlfriend and why I would want to date such a plain-looking girl. I felt really offended but decided to just ignore her. Admittedly, she is considered pretty as she does have a few admirers at our workplace. She’s also quite nice and helpful. But today, I feel disgusted by her for insulting my girlfriend.
Just a few days ago during lunch, I was chatting with another colleague and she was telling me how envious she was of my girlfriend for having such a good boyfriend like me. She was complaining to me about how stingy her boyfriend was because he rarely treats her to a meal. In contrast, I would often take my girlfriend to some nice restaurant. But honestly I never saw myself as a good boyfriend.
Even during gatherings with my girlfriend’s family, her mom and older sister were always saying how my girlfriend is so lucky to have found a great boyfriend. I feel flattered and happy to hear such words but I still think I’m just an ordinary guy.
The people around me always thought that my girlfriend is the lucky one to have found a boyfriend like me but honestly, I think I’m the lucky one. I met my girlfriend when I was in NS. She was a fresh poly grad, working in a big firm. During BMT, she would travel from Jurong West to Pasir Ris with me whenever I have to book in, and then travel back to her house in Choa Chu Kang. She would always offer to treat me to a nice meal at restaurants because I once complained about the food in camp.
When I was in university, she would always accompany me to the library because I wanted to study. No matter how bored and tired she looked, she would just quietly sit there for the whole day while I do my studies. I remember when my second-hand laptop was spoilt, she offered to buy a new one for me.
When I graduated and started going for interviews, she accompanied me to every interview and encouraged me whenever I failed my interview. And when I finally found a job, she bought me all the formal wear and my first ever brief case, which was super expensive. She said this brief case would be more suitable for me than my 4-year-old sling bag that I bought from Giant.
I remember I once walked past a shop selling expensive watches, I stopped and glanced at the watches, saying how cool those watches were. The following month, she surprised me with the watch I liked, which then became the second watch in my life, the first one being my Casio digital Army watch.
Every morning, she would travel to the CBD with me just to spend more time with me and then travel to her workplace in Queenstown. And every evening, she would wait for me at the cafe below my office while I OT until 9pm.
She works in a big firm but she doesn’t earn much. Probably an average poly grad pay. She never ever buy anything for herself. But she bought so many expensive things for me. She sews her clothes and shoes whenever they are torn. But she would buy clothes and shoes for me whenever mine gets old.
I’m not sure why everyone thinks that she’s lucky to have me. I’m damn sure I’m the lucky one and everyday I feel like I’m the luckiest guy in the world. And I don’t care if my colleagues think that she is just a plain-looking girl. In my eyes, she’s the most beautiful girl in the world. People may think that most guys are shallow and only care about looks. Actually, guys just want a girl who would be there for him.

32767,51313,"#51306 When I was an undergrad in NUS a few years ago, I used to spend <$8 a day for all my 3 meals. Most of the time, it was $1 pau for breakfast, $3 cai png for lunch and $3 chicken rice for dinner. To get by, I used my NS savings and did full-time/part-time internships. My course was 4 years but I couldn't afford to waste another year so I did 6-7 modules every semester to graduate 1 year earlier and not pay the extra course fee. Back then, I was one of the few who did not even own a data plan (costs $42 a month), because that was too expensive. I only started using a smartphone when I was in year 2? I think that was the year M1 had some smartphone rental with a $15-20 plan, at the end of 2 years, you had to return the phone.
My course was CS, and to be honest, it wasn't easy. I wasn't the brightest student, my PSLE score was only 133. But I am sure as hell going to work my ass off. While it took others 20 hours to complete Dr. Steven Halim's practical assignments, it took me a week. That plus a few software engineering projects in other modules, plus my internship commitments, I barely had any time left to sleep.
Through it all, one thing remained constant in my life, I, absolutely, completely, love computers. There is something about the way we put 0s and 1s and organize it into beautiful 3D graphics or complex data models, makes me fall in love over and over again. It's like an endless orgasm. Ha ha.
My point is, it kinda sucks sometimes to see others driving their father's car, texting on their pretty iPhones and drinking Starbucks, but let's face it, life is unfair. It will never be fair. Not today, not tomorrow, not a million years from now.
So what if others have a ""better"" life than you? It is all in our minds. We should do what we love to do and be thankful for the little things in our life....
Your mother yelling ""AH BOY!!"", ohh what a beautiful sound. The sweet smell of burning hell notes during 7th month. Church bells ringing early in the morning. Old man at TPY playing the harmonica. All these things are so wonderful it makes my heart throb for joy.
We are in Singapore. We have relatively good infrastructure, no natural disasters, corruption-free (or haven't caught yet) government. Our hawker food is cheap & good. The weather in Singapore is wonderful. There is no snow, so we don't need to pay for heating bills. It is hot, but you can go to the library or shopping mall for free aircon. Alternatively, you can mediate and not sweat in the slightest. Water is clean too. Our kids are in school. The adults have jobs. Everyone can get a house even if it is just for 99 years. Students are not rioting but debating online.
TLDR; Life is unfair. It will never be fair. Live and let live.

40227,63311,"Honestly, what's with the recent truckload of guy having to pay for girl and all that bullshit.
My story - Singaporean girl here, met husband in NUS. After 1 yr of dating, we decided that we were serious abt our r/s and started discussing plans for our future (marriage, kids, pre wedding photoshoots, honeymoon etc). We knew we needed a lot of money to make things work and we weren't rich. So while all our peers were partying away, going on couple holidays/staycay/getaways and grad trips; we were there giving private tuition and working our asses off during summer hols. We set up a joint account where we would contribute our hard earned money in. Of course, we had our own personal accounts but it weren't significant. We would scrimp and save wadever we can to make our dreams work. At e start of our r/s, we went dutch with the occasional presents for each other. After confirming that I'm the one for him, he decided to pick e tab most of e time (I'd insist on paying sometimes if its too expensive). As a result, I understand that he will not have much savings compared to me. Yrs later. He grad a yr earlier than me but didnt managed to get a job immediately. As such, he took up waitering temporarily to earn some money - determined to marry me when I grad.
When I grad, I got a job immediately, earning more than him (even after he changed job from waitering to desk bound). I paid for all our dinner dates. Our wedding - we copaid for our rings, our banquet, our local and overseas pre wedding photoshoots and our honeymoon. Many of our frens were shocked as to how we did it in e year of my graduation; thinking we had financial help from our parents when we did not. Its amazing how 2 of us even saved at least 250k before e age of 30.
Fast forward till today. We own a condo and have children of our own. I paid double e amt my hubby paid for our condo but I don't draw the lines with him and say hey, you're the man, you're supposed to pay for that roof over my head or I don't wanna marry you. Nah. We work tgt as a team. We support each other when we can. And now when I'm no longer working to care for our children, he pay for all the bills to support our family.
Moral of e story is - if you love somebody wholeheartedly and see a future with them, work tgt as a team. Make it work. Don't be so calculative. Dreams take flight when you work tgt, not thrash each other.

We already talked about marriage, applied for BTO, planned for our future wedding dates, etc. Everyone thought that we will definitely get married one day. But others don't see what's really happening between us. He is a smart guy, with high paying job and constantly given praises by people around him. Basically he is like the Mr Perfect in everyone's eye. He was the one who chased me. When we first got together, we felt like we complement each other. Eventually, it started to become me chasing after his perfection. Like because he is this perfect, I need go be as perfect. And no, he didn't tell me it is ok to be who I am cause that's who he really loves, he expects me to be as perfect as him. He finds me watching drama, reading blogs all these as wasting my time away (PS: I only do it once I'm done with my work). He always talk on the phone about work and when I commented that I didnt get enough attention from him, he said at least he is doing something that earns money and not laze around. But I was in love. Afterall, he is the Mr Perfect and everyone tells me how I should not lose him. Then it started to take a toll on my mental health, crying to sleep everynight cause I felt like I was never good enough. I communicated the issues with him and he didn't feel like he has any wrong. Eventually, we decided to go on our separate ways, and gave up on our BTO.
The rs was so painful that it took me 2 years to decide that I need to start opening my heart again. Went on some dates (dating app) and went on a few dates with those I thought we have chemistry when talking via app but ZERO chemistry when we met irl.
At 33 years old, I met a guy via mutual friend. We hit off instantly. I really enjoyed talking to him. He is not perfect.. not well educated, earn less than me, slightly shorter than me, few years younger than me. To put it bluntly, people would say he ""pick until gold"" if I ever agree to be his gf. I shared with my friends that I was interested in him and none of my friends felt that we can work out cause he is too different from my previous Mr Perfect style. But I went ahead to agree to be his gf within one month after knowing him.
And fast forward, I am 37 year old now. He proposed to me after we were together for only 3 months cause he felt like I am the one for him, just as how I also told him I felt like he is the one for me. We got married 10 months after getting together. We are going to celebrate our 3 years wedding anniversary soon and our first son came out just last year.
Couples can be together for 10 years and still breakup while couples who are tgt for 10 days could meant for ever. Length of rs does not determine how successful the rs will be. It could be 10 years old quarrel or 10 months of working towards being one. So it is never too late to break up with the wrong one. I thought I was gonna be single for life but my soul mate appeared when I was no longer looking. It may be late but it's better than suffering all my life being with the wrong one.
Don't ever decide your life based on society norms. Do what you think is best for you and your mental health. Ask yourself what makes you happy and do all the happy things when you are single. Share those happy moments when you meet your future soul mate down the road and eventually share more happy moments when you find the one.
Jiayou!

56278,97257,"I am a 35/M and I went to a top secondary school and JC in Bishan.
I grew up around teenagers who prided themselves on their academic performance, on their CCA performance, and believed strongly that they will become highly successful people in the future. I had 2 classmates in JC, now best friends, who told me that they will hit a million dollars in annual salary by the time they reach 35, both of whom went to Oxbridge. Every single straight-A type that I knew had this air of arrogance around them, because I truly believe that they believed that they were better than the rest of us, that they will unerringly turn out to be more successful than any of us.
There was this girl I met in J1. She was a quiet girl who was from a neighborhood secondary school who happened to be in the same OG and class as I was. She was really timorous, really shy. She didn't have the best grades, and was notorious for skipping CCA. I was always confused by how nonchalant she was about schoolwork, how she always copies my homework, and how I have never once seen her studying. She eventually retained, and I lost contact with her.
I was recently having coffee alone at a cafe. She was fiddling around with the POS system. I recognized her immediately because she looked exactly the same as she did in JC. She did her hair up the same way. I approached her to say hello, and she told a younger girl to make her a flat white, and she came to sit with me at my table.
We started chatting about the old days, and I found out she got BCCC/B at A-levels, and did business at SMU. It also turns out that she owns the cafe, along with 13 other F&B establishments in Singapore and JB. Her share of the profits in 2018? 2.7 million. I was speechless for a while. Meanwhile my friends who went to Oxbridge, one of whom on a PSC scholarship, are now civil servants, both earning just a little between 10-15K a month. That's a good salary, but I was mediocre in JC (ABBC/A) and even I am earning more than 15K as a management consultant.
We have created a system of flawed meritocracy where children are brought up believing that just because you are the best in school, you're always going to be best in life. The logic is flawed because being the best in school just means you're going to be ""good"" in life. In most cases, you're just as likely as anyone to become ""great.""
If we think about it, kids become great in school because they understand the system well, and because there is generally a very clear methodology to become great. As long as you don't challenge the system, as long as you work within the ""rules,"" you'll come out on top. In the real world, there are several lines of work in which it is valuable to be able to work well within a system. The SAF for example. Probably explains why the word ""scholar"" always gets paired up with ""general"" in Singapore.
I think we, as a nation, need more humility when we think that the best people in school deserve more praise than any other student. People are good at different things, and school, being able to follow instructions to the hilt, is just one thing.

19855,30152,"If you see an uncle studying in NUS, it could be me. I might be the oldest student in NUS, why is this so? I had a problematic past that is not known by many. The media had approached me on countless occasions to invite me to share my story. However I do not want to attract too much attention because uncle already has a family now. Luckily, social media is wonderful because I can share my story anonymously.
This is my story of how two women changed my life.
I grew up in a family with 3 other siblings and I’m the youngest of them all. Although my siblings are good role models who excel in studies, I didn’t follow their examples. In fact I was the most rebellious one who never failed to make my mother’s anger hit the boiling point. During my teenage years, I joined the secret society and done many notorious stuffs. Whenever I got detained by the police, my mother would never fail to bail me out. But she would nag at me for the entire journey back home. “你为什么学人家打架？你再这样每三天就进警擦局，老板要炒我鱿鱼 了。”. Later on, we had a big quarrel and I left home when my mother threaten to disown me. I remembered before I walked out of the door, I told her that “I don’t need a mother like you, no big deal”. Looking back now, I realized how unfilial I was. That’s the worst thing I can say to my mother.
My old secondary school was considered to be a rubbish dump, where all delinquents gathered. Fighting is like drinking water to us, only the one with the hardest fist command all respect. Growing up in this environment made me think that fighting solves all problems.
I was never early for school. Every morning, I just simply stared at the prefect on duty, he/she would definitely be intimidated and let me in without fail. One fine day, I was late as usual. The new prefect on duty was a cute petite girl. I smiled at her and asked her to let me in but she refused to do so, hence I resorted to my usual intimidation method but she stared back right into my eyes instead. In the end, I my discipline master slapped me with 1 week worth of detention. I kept swearing and cursing because this little chilli padi wounded my ego. Therefore I decided that I had to teach her a lesson. After school, I gathered my underlings and went into to her classroom to mess up her table and poured out all her belongings from her bag. Initially she tried to fight back by scratching me insanely hence I had to push her back into her chair. Tears started flowing out of her eyes while she stared at me with a face full of hatred as if I had killed her parents. I’m a person who has a soft spot for girls who are crying. Being totally clueless on how to pacify a crying girl, I left in a hurry after telling her, “You win”.
That night I just couldn’t forget the way she stared at me. I touched the scratch marks on my hand and smile. The very next morning, I brought a really big lollipop and waited for her to appear at the school gate so that I could apologize to her. She refused to accept my apology despite how relentlessly I tried. Finally she broke her silence and told me to take a step back. I followed her order without thinking and she slammed the school gate right in my face. “You are late for school again. Please wait for teacher to open the door for you bah.” I got outplayed out by her yet I’m not angry at all. Strangely I was feeling happy instead as I had developed interest in this sadistic little chilli padi.
The probability of me getting to know her is close to zero because I’m the kind of guy she detests the most. Luckily fate played a part in matching us up. When I heard that another ah beng was finding trouble with her, I raced to her classroom immediately. I dragged him out of the classroom and gave him a beating. I nearly got expelled due to this incident and I was shocked when I learnt that she actually begged the principal to pardon me. This incident brought us closer, then nature took its course and soon we became an item. I brought a super big Doraemon plushie to school on the day I confessed to her. The size of the plushie attracted a lot of unwanted attentions. I literally sacrificed my reputation in order to woo her. Looking back now, it felt silly but chasing a girl requires you to do 100 or even 1000 silliest stuffs.
I should have cut my connection with the secret society and be a good son/boyfriend. At that point of time, brotherhood meant everything to me, fighting for my brothers is like a natural law. On the night of our 3rd anniversary, I received a call from my gang leader informing me that another gang had slashed one of our own. Before I could leave, she grabbed my arm and told me:
“Can you promise me that you will never get into a fight again? I’m very tired of it already. I will really walk away if you ever fight again.”
I brushed her hands off and lied to her that I need to go home to settle some family issues, before rushing off to meet my brothers. It was a path of no return. I collected my weapon from my leader’s van and proceeded to the clashing point. In the midst of all the hectic fighting, the image of my girlfriend kept flashing in my mind. This isn’t my first experience in this kind of fight but I was overcome by fear on that night. I started sweating profusely and voices of my girlfriend kept ringing in my ears repeating what she had said earlier. For the first time in my life, I was really scared therefore I ran away from the fight. A sharp object slashed through my arm when I was finding my way out of the mess. I knew that it was a deep cut however I gripped my wounded spot tightly and continue to run. I don’t know what I was thinking on that night, all I want is to see my girlfriend’s face immediately. When I she saw me at the door step, she burst into tears and started hitting me. I felt a deep remorse for breaking my promise to her. Not long afterwards, the police tracked me down and arrested me. Apparently someone had died in that earlier gang fight and I was placed under suspicion of murder. Till today, I can still remember the sight of her crying when the officers escort me into their vehicle. I kept yelling at her, asking her to just go home! But she simply refused to do so.
Murder is a very serious offense in Singapore therefore no amount of money can bail me out. It was at this point of time, everything turn for the worst under Murphy’s Law. My mother’s cancer condition worsens and her life hanged on a tiny thread. No matter how hard I yelled and knocked on the prison door, the officers refused to let me visit my mother in the hospital. The day came when my officer told me that my mother had pass away, I began to weep bitterly. I felt things shouldn’t end this way because I haven’t apologized for all the nasty stuffs I had said. I began to recall the times I spent with my mother. When I was young, I’m afraid of thunder storm in the night. Whenever there was one, I would run into my mother’s room and cuddle under her warmth embrace. During chinese new year, she wouldn’t allow my sibling to touch the chicken drumstick because it belongs to me. On the day of her funeral, I was allowed to make a short visit under police escort. When I met my sister, she got emotional and started shouting at me.
“You still got the face to appear here! Do you know how ma died? Even on her death bed she never stops calling your name with her final breath.”
I was utterly devastated by her words. Till today they haven’t forgive me yet.
Later on, the judge cleared me from all murder charges and gave me a prison sentence. While I was serving my sentence, my girlfriend would visit me every single week. Sometimes she would spot bruises on my body and asked me if I had gotten into fight again? Once in a while some troublemakers would find problem with me so that they can beat me up. The old me would have definitely retaliated however the new me simply shrink up while they rained blows onto me. I can’t continue living my life by relying on my fist. Therefore I started picking up my textbook again. I retook my O levels in the prison school. I worked really hard because I want to become someone my girlfriend can be proud of.
As my release date got nearer, the frequency of her visits decreased. Obviously I was disappointed but I told myself that she might be busy with life. The day of my release finally came and the thought of holding her hands again created butterflies in my stomach. When I walked out of changi prison, she immediately hugged me and greeted me with a bright smile. Soon I realized that there was another guy standing right beside her. My worst fear materialized when I found out that they were dating. All these years in jail, she was the one and only reason that I’m able to keep my sanity under those harsh circumstances. But everything fell apart when she told me to move on with life. Honestly, I was really angry with her for a period of time as I felt betrayed. However, I took a step back and see stuffs in a rational way then things started to make sense. After all, I’m the one who let her down in the first place. I didn’t cherish her and squandered my chance of being together with her. In fact, I should be thankful to her because I might have continued my thug life and maybe end up dying on the streets if she didn’t appeared in my life.
Both my mother and my ex-girlfriend made me who I am today. Realistically, I’m one of the few success cases. I hope that our society will remove our prejudice against ex-convicts. Everyone deserves a second chance. I hope my little story inspires you in one way or another.

44264,71269,"I hope the school can provide proper resting facilities (or even better, rooms) for our cleaners. I always see them sitting at some corners, often without proper chairs or ventilation.
At the very least, make it explicit that they are welcome to share the tables/seats with students. And I hope we students will embrace the idea should it happen.
I asked some of them why they don't just use the tables along the corridors. Some told me they don't dare to do so because they are afraid of receiving complaints from students. Others told me it is more important to save the tables for us because we are studying hard.
If we can build such a new huge-ass Central Library, I'm sure we can carve out a space for our cleaners.

43053,68723,"Hi,
Long post ahead.
I just want to encourage all those who are struggling with your studies/work/finances/relationships/life in general to keep pushing on.
I am in my final year and my NUS journey is nothing but 7 consecutive semesters of struggle, occasionally interspersed with bouts of joy and relief. People around me are somehow always so intelligent and quick to grasp concepts - the same ideas I can take hours and days or even weeks to finally understand.
When people spend 3 hours to churn out an essay and get an A, I spend 3 days planning its outline and researching, and get only a B+. People tell me to study smart and not hard and I already know that (I have read many articles and books and watched videos on it) but I just don't know why. Over time, when people tell me to study smart and not hard, it sounds more sarcastic and hypocritical than constructive lol.
It doesn't help that I have to work part time and I don't have a domestic helper or automated cleaning machine to clean up the house. Some toxic friends/people I have met mocked me for ""having no life"" outside of family and school. Some commented that I am a ""country bumpkin"" because I don't travel or go for exchange. Some say I'm unfriendly because I don't hang out with them often at overpriced hipster cafes. They don't know that my parents are ageing and getting weaker. I don't want them to do too much housework or demand for them to pay for my school fees, overseas holiday, give me pocket money so I can go eat some avocado egg toast that looks better than it tastes.
But I'm not here to complain because I have learnt that complaining is extremely addictive, playing victim to uncontrollable circumstances feels particularly good, but it is also very unhelpful. Nothing is going to change for the better if I sit here and cry about how bad my life is.
Look, I know its hard and I know everyday feels like giving up when there's no visible end in sight. You don't know if things will eventually turn out well and you don't know whether your hard work will pay off.
But you have to remember that in this moment, despite all the uncertainty, your best option is to keep trying even if you fail repeatedly. There is no shame in trying your best. Of course it sucks not to see rewards when you keep trying so hard but at least you can be accountable to your conscience and be absolutely free of guilt when things really do not turn out your way.
Others who make you feel bad about your life problems should be ignored. I have cut off toxic people in my life and while I am left with only a few friends, they are more than enough. Sometimes it's lonelier to be with the wrong people.
You are not a let down when the outcomes don't reflect your hard work. It's just that things can and will never be the way we want to, no matter how many excel spreadsheets you create to plan some ideal vision of a future you strive for. It is this that is what makes life interesting.
Hang on and stay strong.

The black sheep of seniors conducted outrageous sexualised activities. We have failed you.
The public, some of whom cannot discern fact from exaggeration. We have failed you.
The OSA, caught between hell and high waters, decided to sacrifice the Oweek of your batch to straighten things out.
Out of this Pandora's box of mishap, however, there is still one glimmer of Hope left:
Beyond any orientation activity, beyond any camp, certainly beyond any games that you play at the beach, you, your batch, have this saga as a common bond amongst all of you. From Business to Science, from Arts to Engin, your shared experience of having the Oweek cancelled will be your unifying factor. You will be the first batch to have a common (and ironically, uncommon) event to define your batch spirit, and ultimately this is the NUS spirit. Out of the mistakes we the seniors have made, your batch will rise up to take the challenge that every freshie henceforth will have a safe and fun orientation. Your batch shall be the pioneers of a new era, hopefully a better one, where the balance between common sense and the energy of youth can be found. You will prove to the Singaporean public that the youth are not afraid, we will admit what needs to be changed and will change it to be even better.
To the seniors who have poured their heart and souls dedicating yourselves to a fulfilling orientation for the freshies: here is my salute.
To members of the public who has tried to reason and weighed the situation in spite of all the sensationalising by the news outlets: here is my salute
To OSA who are trying to salvage the university's dignity: here is my salute.
And to Cohort AY2016/17, here is my salute for being the sacrificial lamb cleansing almost a decade of wrong. I give my challenge to you: break traditions. Forge friendships that even we the seniors would have never dream of even with orientation camps. Give the best orientation the next cohort of freshies can ever have. We will stand by you. Because we are NUS.

During a break, I checked home and my mum told me the person who answered my phone will make arrangements through my friend's number to return me by end of the school day. I was skeptical if the person would actually show up but I kept my hopes up.
I still have lessons so my friend waited at the agreed time and place to collect my phone on my behalf. My friend did managed to meet the guy who picked up my phone and got it back for me. What a relief!
Come evening the revelations of not recovering my phone became real and I felt compelled to reward him so I texted the guy that I really wish to reward him or at least a lunch treat as thanks as I didn't even get to meet him. He declined twice even after my mum insisted and he told me...
""I have a young son. One day if my son loses his phone, I wish someone would return his phone too. There's no need to reward me or anything. Pay it forward.""

50506,84771,"I came from a rather poor family. I used to live in a 3-room flat with my parents and older brother. My dad used to earn around $1000 a month but he was a very hardworking person. My mom was a housewife. She was very strict with us. She would always make sure I finish my homework and revision.
Everyday my mom would cook very simple dishes but she would let me eat ice-cream once or twice a month. Sometimes we would eat at kopitiam where I would share cai png with my brother. Every year, my parents would bring me to Swensen's on my birthday. I always looked forward to my birthday as it was the only day where I get to eat at a restaurant.
During weekends, we would visit the library to read storybooks. Sometimes I would play football with my brother. We would crush paper into a ball and pretend it's a football as we couldn't afford toys.
Growing up, I often felt inferior to my peers. I had always envied my classmates for being able to buy food from the canteen. Everyday I had to use food coupons to buy food from the canteen and sometimes I would rather starve because I felt too embarrassed to use these coupons.
During Army, my dad fell very sick. I was overseas for an exercise when his condition deteriorated. I had never felt so helpless in my life. When I came back, he had to undergo a few surgeries which costed a bomb. We often had to scrimp and save to pay for his medical bills. Fortunately we were offered some help and subsidies.
Looking back, I feel that actually I was a very lucky child. My parents didn't have much money but they worked very hard to give me a carefree childhood. They made sure I never have to worry about money. They even discouraged me from doing part-time jobs so I can focus on my studies.
Last year, I graduated and managed to find a job which pays well. I wouldn't have been able to achieve this without my parents' support. Honestly I don't really care about buying branded watches or cars. All I want to do is to give my parents a better life. I'm really thankful to my parents for working so hard to provide for me and my brother. And I'm thankful for all the challenges I faced in my life. I wouldn't have become the man I am today if it wasn't for all the hardships I have been through. With that, I end my story with one of my favourite quotes from Bruce Lee: ""Do not pray for an easy life, pray for the strength to endure a difficult one.""

27183,42874,"Hello everyone, today I’m here to share a story about my ex-girlfriend.
My whole family was from NUS – from my parents, to my cousins, and to my elder brother. My results weren’t as good, so I went to poly. The company that I interned with gave me a contract, wanting to hire me as a full-timer as soon as I finished with army. My family was not happy – they had hoped that I too would go to NUS after army, and get a higher pay when I start work. Although I was close to my family, there were some inevitable comparison between my brother and I when I ultimately chose to sign the contract with my company.
Fast forward to a couple of years later to that fateful summer when I first met her – it was during the holidays when she just finished her A levels, and she came into my company as a part-timer earning some cash before uni started. She was smart; graduated from Hwachong and you guessed it, going to study at NUS once term starts. She was shy, but extremely witty and has an infectious smile. My other colleagues tease her about never having a boyfriend before, blaming it on her looks and physique, rating her a mere 6/10 with makeup and the right clothes. She never showed any anger, instead choosing to laugh it off and take it in stride. It all made her very likeable.
Before long, I knew that I was catching feelings for her, but I tried to rationalise with myself. She was smart, and going to graduate with honours, whereas I only have a diploma to my name. She was younger and going back to school, I was a few years older and staying to work. Despite all that, we had similar interests and grew close.
On her very last day of work, she pulled me aside, confessing her feelings for me. I was pleasantly surprised, but made the choice to turn her down, citing that between her schoolwork and my workload, we will never work out. I had expected to her to silently vanish from my life as she became more involved with school; after all, she was likeable, and I was certain she had lots of suitors.
As fate would have it, she did not vanish – we kept in touch (up to this day, I still have no idea how), and the company continued hiring her as a part-timer during her winter and summer breaks. She even had a semester where she did her internship in the company! As time passed and as I spent more time with her, I realised that she integrated herself as part of my life, and I couldn’t stand the thought of her with some NUS guy. When she was in Year 2, I started dating her, seeing if we could make things work out despite being at different places and despite our different schedules. By some miracle, it did work out – with her putting up with dates nearer to the company, with me finding her at NUS on my freer days.
It was when she was a Year 3 did I finally ask her to officially become my girlfriend. Making time for each other became easier, our age became less of an issue as time passed. Even my main concern, our differing education background, was nothing to worry about – my parents were won over by her charm, and likewise for her parents. Eventually, she graduated, and coincidentally was hired by a company located near to mine, and our frequency of dates increased.
It seems all smooth-sailing, so you must be wondering, why did I say that I was sharing a story about my ex-girlfriend? Because just recently, she is no longer my girlfriend – she is now my fiancé. If you’re reading this, happy anniversary dear, and thank you for sticking with me! May we have a very happy life ahead of us.

48781,80916,"**warning long post ahead**
I’m a pharmacist in a public hospital heavily affected by COVID-19. Today I would like to share with you some of the efforts of my pharmacy colleagues during this trying time. For those of you who have no idea what a pharmacist does, or those of you who think you do, please, read on.
First let’s begin with Community Pharmacies such as Guardian, Watsons and Unity. These are our front liners first hit by the Covid effect. They fended off hundreds who came on a daily basis to demand masks, sanitizers and soap that simply wasn’t available. They provided these products, without even sparing any for themselves. They had to deal with enquiries and panic from the public on a virus that wasn’t well researched at the time. They dealt with anger, and frustration, all the while still having to keep calm about their own fears. While the fight for masks seems to have settled, these pharmacists are now also affected by closures of some stores, dwindling product sales, and perhaps manpower cuts as well. To my friends in the community, thank you for being the first defenders, hang in there.
From the start of the new year, pharmacists were in meetings planning and predicting the onslaught of this virus and what we can do to effectively tide through. When NCID started opening its doors to screen, an urgent call for volunteer pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians was made, to open a new pharmacy to serve potential COVID patients at the screening centre over the Chinese New Year period. Many colleagues willingly volunteered their services, even though they were only given a day’s notice because of the urgency of the developing situation. These pharmacists continue to serve, and are usually the last step before patients are inadvertently are either sent home, or sent up to the wards. They don PPE for hours, work overnight, and eat luke warm meals, for your sake. (STAY HOME!!)
The situation is constantly evolving, and so are the languages. In the COVID wards, pharmacists had to quickly become familiar with all kinds of terms in all sorts of languages. In the beginning, with many chinese patients being admitted, they became adept in the Chinese language - if differentiating Ceftazidime and Cefuroxime is a struggle for you, imagine doing that in chinese!! FYI we need to talk to patients and find out things like their past medications or allergies, cos if you’re allergic to a medication and if our medical teams give it to you without knowing, you could possibly die from that sooner than COVID-19 could ever kill you. Also, if you’ve ever spoken to your parents or grandparents about their medications, you’d know they probably describe them as like the small white round pill, the yellow long capsule without knowing what it’s for. Now try doing that with a foreigner, who has no idea what his meds are for. In a language you don’t understand LOL (most!! intense!! guessing!! game!! ever!!) Guess wrong, and your patient could have a seizure, start having palpitations, break out into rashes, or... die. Kudos to our pharmacists who do this on a daily basis in their wards with 40+ patients, not just during covid, but EVERY DAY. Thank you!!
Just today, Singapore has had our highest spike in Covid-19 cases, and that means emergency measures to MAKE SPACE in the wards. The concept of decantment started early on from weeks ago, where patients who were relatively more stable would be “decanted” to off site facilities such as community hospitals. This protects the patients as well so that we can reduce their potential risk of exposure to the virus. By closing off some wards, this means patients are admitted, and often “discharged” from their original wards much faster than before. Pharmacists battle with the rapid transfers as each patient’s medications needs to be reviewed for accuracy, safety and efficacy prior to transfer, and of course provided with a new bag of medications to bring with them to the new hospital. To put this in perspective, it’s like trying your best to get to know a person you just met RAPIDLY, so that you can give them a great gift basket of all the things they need, accurately, a few days or hours later. To those fighting to decant our patients safely, thank you!!
As more and more data about covid-19 comes up, im sure you’ve heard about people dying from Chloroquine etc. Pharmacists are the drug experts, and we are proud of that. Expert pharmacists are scouring medical journals for evidence on new treatment options, possible vaccinations being developed. They summarise the information for our medical teams in the hospitals to be able to make appropriate decisions at the point of patient care. Pharmacists in the wards are involved in the monitoring of these patients put on experimental drugs. We review the safety and efficacy of such medications, as well as deciding doses based on important monitoring parameters such as patient renal function, liver function, past medical history and current condition. You may have seen news on medications you may need to avoid e.g. Ibuprofen from unverified sources, well pharmacists have had a role in helping debunk that too! We study the mechanisms behind interactions, we rationalise if such things are possible, we justify them if they are, and we do this every day!! Yay Pharmacists!
Behind the scenes, as more countries close their borders, our store and procurement pharmacists fight battles on a daily basis to ensure we have enough medications to tide through however long this crisis may last. While you are worried about whether you can bake your cake tonight with all the flour gone from the shelves, our pharmacists worry that in time, a patient in a pain crisis will not get their opioids because we don’t have any to spare. We are worried patients will have a heart attack or stroke because our hospitals have run out of blood thinners. Pharmacists are looking at data on how we can prolong the use of each vial of medication so that we can conserve for the future, but all these have their limits. And this is why, we need help from you at home to be understanding that we cannot give you 6 months of medications now. We can only give you what you need, because we NEED TO ENSURE THERE IS ENOUGH for other patients (seems like a recurrent theme from our supermarkets and government etcetc. Please lah, tolong don’t hoard... ). Also, FYI we don’t offer exchange or refund. Please: the argument is always the same, that you kept it well in a pristine condition. Well... what if you were the one who recieved the refunded meds, are you ok knowing that it sat for 2 months in someone else’s home??? If you’re not ok, then are pharmacists or the healthcare sector supposed to absorb the cost of the returned meds when you were the one who insisted you wanted a year’s supply? To all of you pharmacists, technicians and friends who have had a patient scream at you because they cannot get what they want, when they want it, stay strong, thank you.
Your grandparents, or parents may have had their appointments rescheduled, so what about their medications? Home delivery services have been extended to all patients, you don’t even have to contact us first, we trace the patients that need a top up, and call YOU instead. This has increased the workload significantly!! With healthcare, it’s not like your Taobao delivery. They deliver wrong, at some inconvenience, you can usually get a return, refund. If pharmacies deliver the wrong meds to the wrong patient, that’s a nightmare. What if the other patient missed their meds because of that? Or what if our elderly frail giddy patient who is illiterate takes the medication meant for a 25 year old with terrible hypertension, causing his blood pressure to drop? So much could go wrong. In some hospitals, even patients discharged will have their medications delivered to them to reduce unnecessary contact. Let me just tell you - explaining medications to a patient in person can be very difficult. Explaining medications to a patient who is xxx km away from you who does not know what you are talking about is nearly impossible. This has increased the time we take to do things significantly!!! But pharmacists remain patient, remain calm, and keep going. Because that is the professionalism we continue to show as a healthcare professional. Thank you!
I know many of us in the pharmacy profession often feel forgotten, but seeing how dynamic our profession is during times of crisis, I hope this is a good reminder of why we serve. There are so many roles of the pharmacist which I have not been able to share, because I am not the best person to, but to our researchers, regulatory pharmacists, IT pharmacists, and so many more, thank you. For all of us (even other healthcare professionals too!) who feel you are not directly at Screening Centre, NCID, TTSH, etc - no matter what, be proud to call yourself a COVID-19 Frontliner, because you are. Each and every one of us is necessary to keep this healthcare system going. Stay positive, Stay motivated, we are in this for the long run.

Our dates were mostly hunting for cheap and good hawker food, cooking at home, going shopping in neighbourhood markets, streaming movies online and cuddling. We didn't celebrate anniversaries, partly because he couldn't afford and always refused to have me pay for everything, but mostly as we didn't bother to remember the dates. For everyday we were together in the past years was special and I would not trade my days with him for any gold or diamonds. I love my poor boyfriend, except now that he has becomed my debt-free/start-up owner/decent income earner/still extremely hot fiancée. We still don't celebrate anniversaries, and we still go hunting for cheap deals. He still opens the door for me, pulls out chairs and tells me he loves me everyday. We just bought our first home together in a pretty condo (missed the HDB income ceiling by a few thousands) and are expecting our first baby in a few months time. Girls, believe in your men.

50575,84887,"Dear Admin, please post this even though i am not a NUS student. I would like to use this platform to express my gratitude.
My elderly father was recently discharged from the hospital after undergoing a surgery to remove a tumor. On our way home, he is perfectly fine and was even telling me about how he was looking forward to eat his favourite chicken rice after all the bland food in the hospital.
Soon, we reached home and I proceeded to help my dad off the vehicle before parking the car. As i was walking my dad towards the lift lobby, he suddenly told me that he was in pain. Confused, i asked him where was the pain. Before he could answer, he collapsed to the floor. My first instinct was to call the ambulance but I had left my phone in the car, and i did not want to leave my father alone to retrieve it. His whole body was cold and he wasn't responding even though his eyes was open. I panicked and started shouting for help. I was just crying hysterically and was basically pleading for someone to help my dad.
I understand that it is the COVID season but literally no one rendered any help to my dad. They were just looking at us like we are zoo animals and stood quite far away. As i was screaming for someone to call the ambulance, someone came towards me and offered to help check on my dad. He told me that he is only a second year medical student but he can try to help. He quickly took control of the situation by telling someone to get him an AED and also got someone to call the ambulance. The sequence which followed was a blur as i was in a state of shock. All i remembered was that the student did some checks on my dad and told me that my dad was likely having a stroke. At some point, my dad lost consciousness and he started performing CPR all the way until the ambulance arrived.
My dad is currently warded in the hospital. After checks by the doctor, It was indeed due to a stroke in his left brain. He is currently recovering and is back to his old jovial self , even joking that maybe he got a stroke from missing his favourite chicken rice too much.
I would like to thank the medical student for stepping forward when everyone else did not. He managed to save my dad's life and i can't even thank him properly. I did not manage to get his name at that time as i was panicking. Also, I want to thank NUS medical school for training your medical students so well. His actions was selfless and he came forth to help even though that might put him at a risk of getting COVID. Thank you for saving my dad.

Hence, I duplicated a set of key and gave it my girlfriend, so she can at least study in my room while I am out. My friends told me that she have been letting some dude into my room occasionally, and I questioned her but she denies it every time. I trusted her. One day, I hid in my wardrobe and told my girlfriend I left for the gym. An hour passed and she brought a dude (her faulty mate) into the room. I was disgusted, but I told myself maybe it was just a project meeting. They became intimate and started kissing. I could not bear to see this any longer and came out of the wardrobe. I took my macbook which was on the table and smashed it on the dude's face and shouted at them to leave. Now I am a loss on what to do with my macbook. Can someone please advice where I can repair my macbook cheaply and if the warranty covers this damage? Thanks.

59355,104605,"There I was having dinner with my son when I notice them. A couple sitting near us. Both of them glued to their phones minding their own business while munching their food. Zero interaction.
My first impression with them was harsh. ""Going out on a date and still on their phones? What's the point?"" Then suddenly the boy show the girl something on the phone and the girl responded with a smile.
I notice the guy's dressing. Tee shirt with some anime characters, jeans. He is a typical geeky looking guy. No toned muscles or good physic, thick glasses, abit messy hair. He definately didn't work out or groom himself much. A typical guy that look like he spend alot of time indoors.
The girl? Typical nerdy girl. Golden specs, ponytail. Wearing light color sleeved tee shirt and mid length shorts. Neat socks and shoes. She is not gorgeous and make-up looks minimal. No guys will give her a 2nd look.
I can see both of them with their shopping bags, from a nearby shop selling Japanese anime novelties and toys. I concluded they like watching anime and reading mangas.
The guy is explaining or discussing something to the girl. I hear it's something about some anime series. The boy got very technical, sharing the plot, the character and whatnot. He basically geeked out in his conversation. If he is talking to normal folks, everyone would be bored to death.
But the girl, she is listening intentively. I can see she is engaging and her eyes glittering. She is enjoying the conversation.
There they are, enjoying each other's company yet take breaks in between while checking out their phones. I realised this is how introverts communicate. They need their own space but also enjoy other's company, as long as their space is maintained.
They were very cute in my eyes. This also prove that anyone deserves love regardless if your looks or your hobbies. I hope their relationship continue to flourish and go further. To prove that even nerds or plain looking people can find love.

50639,85057,"My boyfriend and I have been together since I was 24. He is 6 years younger than me so he was a student when we first met.
When I first started dating him, my parents and relatives often persuaded me to dump him as soon as I can. They told me that he's too young for me and that I deserve someone better.
Back then, I had a few suitors who were much older than my bf. My bf was from a low income family while I was from a middle income family. My parents often encouraged me to dump my bf and get to know more about my suitors, who were graduates with high paying jobs. I understand my parents' good intentions but I didn't want to break up with my bf. So I lied to my parents that I had already broken up with him but I continued to meet him in secret.
It was really tough being with my bf. During his NS, I could only meet him once a week. I also had to find all sorts of excuses and lie to my parents just to meet my bf. Whenever my parents and relatives ask me about my dating life, I had to lie to them that I have no bf. Only my sister and friends knew that I have a bf.
Fortunately, I had a stable job which pays well. Hence I could afford to pay for our dates. Although he would always offer to pay for our meals, I would still insist on paying him back the full amount. My sister often told me that men should pay for everything but I thought it would make more sense for me to pay since I have an income.
Although my bf did many internships and part-time jobs during uni, he was very frugal and always offered to contribute to his household expenses. My sister often frowned upon my relationship with my bf because I would always offer to help my bf with his expenses.
Now, my bf has graduated and has been working for close to a year. He's still a frugal person but he's willing to spend money on me. He even offered to give me a significant sum of money every month. I told him I don't need his money but he insists on giving me money. There was once I asked him why he always insists on giving me money, he said, ""For the past 7 years, you have been taking care of me. Now it's my turn to take care of you."" Although I have never expected that he would find a good job and give me money, I still feel very very touched when he said that to me. I'm really glad I have not given up on him when everyone told me to do so. And the best thing is now my parents have finally accepted him. I guess love really does conquer all obstacles!

41748,65932,"Hi everyone, I’m currently serving NS but I’ve been accepted to NUS so i hope it’s okay if i post my experience on toxic masculinity here. (Don’t worry it’s not an army-bashing post)
My parents, like most love me very much. They would always check up on my studies, ask if i need money when going out and gave their 110% to support me when enlisting (i.e calling me at night, picking me up from Pasir Ris, buying me snacks for the week). However, they had a shortcoming which only manifested itself after i POP-ed - Elitism.
I didn’t perform very well for my BMT which meant that i got a posting in a non-combat vocation, specifically a logistics quartermaster. So incase you weren’t aware, there are the 4 perceived “Hero” vocations that are seen as the most elite in the eyes of my parents - Guards, CDO, OCS(Not rly a vocation but status symbol nonetheless , NDU). When my parents were always going on about how I have to go to a “Hero” vocation and were absolutely crestfallen when they had heard about my posting. Connections were called and requests were written to various places (All behind my back).
And when those efforts proved fruitless, it was when i realised how toxic they could be when it came to my masculinity. I was berated for being in a 姑娘 vocation which was meant for “useless” people. They encouraged me to lie during family gatherings to avoid embarrassment. I had stopped receiving emotional support from them (Calls, rides, a simple “how was your day”). On days were i had offs or half days, i would be greeted with a “why are you home so early” rather than a welcome home. They would compare me with my cousins and ask why I was not able to live up to the standards of the family.
One time they said that i would not get any inheritance from them because a “姑娘” does not need money as she is not the breadwinner of the family. That last one really hit close to home as i have never, nor will i ever ask and pry about money let alone family inheritance so for them to think that I was eyeing their money was really heartbreaking to me.
They recently informed me that they won’t be attending my specialist graduation parade which was really what drove me to craft this post. Mum, Dad I love you both and should the time come, I would die for you. Is that not enough to constitute what a “man” should be.
Anyway I’m not here to ask for advice, I’m dealing with it on my own. I just wanted to let future parents know what I’m going through and should you have a son in the near future, I hope you guys won’t adopt the same mindset as my parents. It really hurts.

48291,79820,"Just want to put my feelings out there. I'm a Primary School teacher. With the current Covid situation, there are many feelings that I'm going through. I can't say this is the same for other teachers out there, but I just want to shed some light into what we do on a daily basis.
Without Covid, our job required us to wake up early in the morning. I'm thankful that I can wake up at 630 because my school is relatively near my house. We start work at 730 and our day doesn't end even when we leave school. We do not have regular meal hours, on some days, we've to gobble our meals in 10 minutes. Once we leave school, we continue our marking and lesson planning at home. This continued every single day. I even felt guilty for taking breaks on weekends.
With Covid, our jobs became a more complex. My teaching subject requires students to be banded, meaning they come from different classes. With the current measures, all students have to revert back to form class with exam-seating style. Meaning, I've new students. And, meaning, we've to somehow go and figure out on our own where did each teacher stopped based on the scheme of work. On top of that, we need to keep track of which student is on LOA/ SHN, when are they coming back and what worksheets to be given to which Form Teacher.
Not withstanding, parents who aren't cooperative and not declaring true information to ICA and MOE. This is making our jobs extra difficult in times like this. I've to admit, I get very frustrated at the measures implemented and the selfishness of people. I've definitely brought these feelings to my classroom. The fact that we've to do wipe-down, remind them to take temperature, remind them to wash their hands and maintain social distancing, it wasn't the easiest.
Yet, I've never heard a complaint from my students. I teach P4 and P5s, yet, none of them, said anything that was of inconvenience to them. Just this Friday, one of my ""new"" student, who wasn't formally from my class, said, I've learned so many new words today. It wasn't a fanciful lesson, it was a simple lesson I planned because I simply had no extra energy to make a more engaging lesson. But, amidst the uncertainties, my children were eager to learn. They're the ones who would wait for their teachers to come in the class. They were like me, who knew they had a new teacher on Monday. I was like them too, but why did I complained when my students, weren't. They looked forward to learning from me.
His words reminded me of a student who asked me this, why did you join teaching? My replied was, I love interacting with children like you. Her reply was, that's what my Mummy says so too! Imagine this, this is what the children and parents expected of us, as educators. We somehow or rather, became their safe place. A place where students and parents feel safe.
I can't say for all teachers out there, but I do feel unappreciated at times like this. But I just want to let all teachers know that, our students appreciate the calmness we bring to our class. They appreciate that they have a familiar face to see every day. So, let's do this for our children, what we believe strongly in and win the fight again Covid. As long as our hearts are for the children, that's all it matters.

Rape allegations and cases of outrage of modesty should never be taken lightly. However, this whole saga has been a joke. An anonymous confession as the origin of this whole shitstorm, then the newspaper version of goodyfeed hinged onto this confession and proceeded to publish a scandalous article with questionable journalism ethics making blind sweeping statements. Then Singaporeans as usual, gobbled this garbage down like drugs and started to form their own Internet lynch mobs making statements like ""how all future leaders are rapists"" and ""universities are so useless, thank God I didn't go to university"". Lastly, NUS did not disappoint me with its typical Singapore organisation style of knee jerk reaction by blanket cancelling all Orientation Week.
What a joke Singapore. No objective and level-headed discussions and actions, everybody just want a shitshow and comment about ""how morally or intellectually superior they are compared to the rapists in nus"".

40527,63802,"Dear all local university graduates, when you are searching for a job, please ask for a realistic pay.
Over the past week, I have interviewed some students who have ZERO working experience asking for pay of 7k and onwards. When asked for their reason for wanting that pay, their reason? ""I graduated from a local university with first class honor""
Word of advice to all
1. Please study the company properly before asking for sky high pay. Not all companies are Google, JP Morgan, Facebook that can give you sky high pay.
2. Continuing from point 1. find out who are you interviewing with and read up on his/her profile on LinkedIn etc. I have a handful of candidates whom are already informed that they are meeting the ""Regional Managing Director - APAC"" still tries to correct me on my company.
3. Don't get all defensive and offended when the interviewer ask you ""Why do you think you deserve this pay"" etc.
4. Grades is nothing to the eyes of more and more companies, we are looking for the right person with the right attitude. Few years back, I hired a student from NUS who was nearly expelled twice and took 6 years to complete his degree. Today he is one of my managers with a team of 20 under him.

I can't believe I've been on this side of the line. I hope Guy B reads this. Please, leave her. I've already stopped replying, and I've felt sick to my gut for atleast 12 hours now. If a friend hadn't shown me this as a funny story, I probably would have never found out that the girl who told me to wait for her response had a boyfriend.
I'm broken, and I feel guilty, and logically I know it isn't my fault, but I still can't help it

50402,84501,"My older brother is my greatest inspiration. Despite all the failures in life, he remains positive.
Since young, he struggled in his studies. He wasn't academically inclined.
His form teacher often criticised him for his poor grades. He did poorly for every subject except Art. So he went to the normal academic stream in secondary school.
He did badly for his 'O' levels and couldn't qualify for Polytechnic. However, his Art subject was good.
He applied for an Animation course at a Polytechnic through Direct Poly Admission.
He went for an interview at the poly. He spent a long time preparing his portfolio and passed the interview.
He worked very hard but his poly grades were average. He failed all his interviews for every university's art school he applied for.
During his NS, he took up many art related courses. After finishing NS, his friend recommended him to work as temp admin in a MNC.
Because of his good performance at work, he was converted to a perm staff. Out of an interest in business studies, he later took up a part-time business degree course at a private uni.
He would often sacrifice his sleep for his school projects and exams. Fortunately, he managed to pass every module and earn his degree.
His uni grades were also average. But his good work ethics and passion for work earned him recognition. He slowly worked his way up the corporate ladder through sheer hardwork.
Despite his long working hours, he provided art related services to friends and relatives for free.
Over the years, he has built a comprehensive portfolio. He was finally recognised for his efforts and managed to secure a place in an Art school.
He quit his corporate job and focused on Art school. He did a lot of art-related freelance work and internships. He also worked part-time at restaurants and relied on savings from his corporate job.
Upon graduation, he did an internship at an animation studio. He finally got converted to full-time at the end of the internship.
He's now an animator at the studio. He doesn't earn a lot but he's happy with his life. He's so passionate about his work he often forgets to eat lunch.
I once asked him if he has ever regretted giving up his highly paid corporate job.
He replied, ""Regret? Sometimes, yes. When I see my friends going overseas, enjoying life. But most of the time, I'm content.""
To him, happiness is not getting straight As or making a lot of money. Happiness is being content with what you have.

Anyway we were walking up a flight of stairs and a lady and her 4/5 year old child walking down. My first instinct was 'should I let go of his hand' because some parents think their child can catch the gay by seeing two guys hold hands or whatever. But to our surprised she actually smiled and gave us a thumbs up. My boyfriend was so touched afterwards and it really brightened our day.

39641,62143,"I'm a woman and I feel sorry for the Nicholas guy in the Monica Baey saga. Don't get me wrong - I'm not affiliated with Nicholas in anyway, nor do I think what Monica did was wrong or attention seeking or all those things the (horrible) (male) commenters are saying (everytime I read these kind of comments I feel sick). I just think that the perpetrator's current fate - having his face plastered all over the Internet with his army details and IC details and job details, even his (innocent?) girlfriend's face open for everyone to see - is a fate much much worse than if he had suspended longer, expelled, or even sentenced to jail for the what the 1 week that offenders usually seem to get. The system might be too lax for offenders, and that is something that the new Penal Code is already changing and NUS should also work towards, but his current situation is more akin to a public stoning. What more of his girlfriend, his family and his friends' who didn't do anything and now can no longer show their faces in public. The purpose of a jail term, or other sanctions, is to appropriately punish the offender, but then also to rehabilitate him and for him to change and move on with his life. If he doesn't change, then the system (is supposed to) punish him again.
I blame NUS and the police force for this. If they had just handled the situation properly in the first place, it would not be such a fiasco as it stands now. If a 1 term suspension and a warning is the standard precedent for such first time offenders, they should have at least communicated this to Monica and the school, or have the guidelines and disciplinary committee procedure online for everyone to read. Taking Monica's word for it, they did not bother to involve the victim in the process at all or care about her welfare. And they should have provided avenues for Monica and other members of the community to feedback if anyone felt measures were not sufficiently taken, instead of forcing her to engage in this witch hunt just to get any answers at all. Nicholas committed an offence, a crime even - but ultimately his lame apology letter and one semester suspension was just what the school asked him to do, and the lack of police prosecution. He is being crucified not just for his crime, but for the problems of the entire system.
The heart of the problem is NUS's - and perhaps Singapore's - culture of paternalism and arrogance. The authority always knows best, there is no transparency or opportunity for feedback or change, so much so that they don't bother about keeping the victim informed of what is happening - one email only?? How is that right - - or give the victim and the school community options to feedback for change. Its about keeping everything under wraps, saving face, and not telling anyone anything because students are stupid and don't know any better than school admin. And this is evidenced by their first statement about this matter ""we will convene a committee and get back to you next academic year""? There's not even an attempt to bother to address the public's concern. I'm willing to give NUS the benefit of the doubt that some investigation and disciplinary procedures are in place and were carried out, even if they may not be ideal. If they had just come out to share this, then the next issue is moving to improve these systems, rather than the state and flak they're receiving now.
Serves NUS right that it all is blowing up in their face. Pity for Nicholas that he is nothing more than a scapegoat for the system's incompetence.

40109,63117,"Hi #63097, my bf is also a poly dropout. I met him during poly orientation and we started dating awhile after. He dropped out after a year and got enlisted while I went to uni after poly.
He decided to drop out because no matter how hard he studied, he was still failing most of his modules. Apparently, he just wasn't academically inclined.
He then enlisted in army and his army friend recommended him to work as a waiter at his friend's father's restaurant during the weekend.
After finishing army, out of an interest in cooking, he did a part-time course at a culinary school while continuing his part-time waiter job. Upon finishing the course, he worked as an apprentice at a restaurant.
He worked very hard and took many part-time courses and participated in competitions along the way. He slowly worked his way up from apprentice to head chef.
He then went on to work at a five star hotel as a junior chef and recently got promoted to sous chef, which pays him more than what I earn as an accountant.
It took him many years of hardwork to get to where he is now. It's definitely way harder for someone without paper qualifications to find a job that pays well. But as long as you're willing to constantly improve yourself and prove yourself to be worthy, there would always be a place for you to shine.
Success is not determined by how much paper qualifications or how many A's you've got. It's your attitude that determines your success.

Yes it is difficult, having to take on part-time jobs (currently taking on 2 part-time jobs) all my life but I do not complain for my parents are my motivation to continue to push through the demands of both school and work.

When did we plan the financial savings? Since 2016 when we got together, met her in uni. We were dead serious about settling down together so yeah we decided we need to work out the savings we would need. I knew in order to earn quite a big as a starting pay, then i’d gotta work hard to atleast secure a 2nd uppers. So yeah we both motivated one another, and we both graduated 2nd uppers. Yeah not a first class but oh well, i was busy giving like tuitions, had 4-5 students and i really saved whatever amount i could. And i also played represented school for sport and I actually did alot of odd jobs during uni and did internship and yeah i think those stuff i did actually helped me become a better person at work now. “A jack of all trades, is a master of none but oftentimes better than a master of one”
She’s pretty matured too...so she doesn’t really take it to heart about petty things like valentine’s day, not even her birthday. She’s like nahhh it’s cool, just have dinner with me after work anywhere, would be fine. We’re married now, and we just find things to make it work. I’d wake up earlier to iron her work clothes and she would like fold the clothes after she comes back from work. That kind of thing. Basically there’s a synergy.

55250,94795,"5 months ago, as I was leaving my house for work and walking to the bus stop, I noticed a few strangers staring at me and avoiding me. As I was waiting for my bus, a woman who’s wearing a beige cardigan suddenly approached me and told me, “You forgot to wear mask.” I instinctively checked my pockets and backpack to see if I have a mask but realised I don’t have any. Seeing how anxious I was, she then asked me if I need a mask and proceeded to pass me an extra mask from her bag. As soon as she passed me the mask, her bus came and she quickly left. Since then, I started carrying extra masks in my bag.
A few weeks later, I saw a woman wearing a beige cardigan and I thought to myself that it could be the one who gave me a mask. Indeed it was her and so I decided to give her a new mask placed in a ziplock. I quickly wrote a Thank You note and put it inside the ziplock before giving her the ziplock. On the Thank You note, I wrote ""You gave me your mask a few weeks ago. Thank you so much. By the way, you're really cute! (:” and sneakily wrote down my number on the back of the note.
A few days later, I received a text saying, “Thank you for the mask! :)” To my surprise, it was her. I honestly did not expect that she would text me and I was so happy that she did. We then started texting and I realised she’s not just a pretty girl but also a very kind person. She’s also a preschool teacher and an active volunteer at animal shelters.
Eventually we started going out and I asked her to be my gf. But my mom doesn’t really like my gf as she thinks my gf is not pretty and quite fat and also 5 years older than me. It really saddens me that some of my friends and relatives have also commented the same thing. My sister even jokingly said that I have been blinded by love.
To me, kindness is the most important quality in a person and it is what makes you beautiful. Every act of kindness counts, no matter how small. On the day I first met my gf, everyone avoided me like the plague because I wasn’t wearing a mask, everyone except my girlfriend. Not only did she not avoid me, she even gave me her mask.
To everyone else, my gf may be just an average-looking chubby girl but in my eyes, she’s the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. If being blinded by love feels like happiness then I would gladly choose to be blind.

38438,59956,"To #59879 - regarding amount to pay for marriage.
I'm a female and currently in marriage discussion with my partner as well. Allow me to share some background - i earn 2 times more than him. Unfortunately, it is due to our difference in educational background but he is not lacking in any way in terms of work ethics, characteristics and all compared to another male uni grad. He was a drop out and im a uni grad.
When we started our relationship, he already told me he had plans to marry me in the future. I saw how ""chose"" when to propose and when to have wedding banquet - its all about money. We basically started a jointed account togerher with a small sum every month, he calculated to be about 3 years. Because I earned a lot more, my personal savings and CPF is also a lot more than him as well.
Initially i agreed to ""hey, lets go with your plan, i wont interfere"" and i eventually realise that marriage and buying houses is not just what he wants, but is what i wanted too. So why should I put most of the burden (espcially financially) on him?
We had a long long talk once about it and came to a conclusion that we should get married when we both feel it's right, not when the money is right. It works in multiple ways - it could be less than 3 years, it could be more than 3 years. We also concluded that it's okay to use my savings for OUR things first (ie. Exclude engagement ring and proposal) if we want to get married. At the end of the day, we are going to be together forever, and those money can be earned back. Time cant wait. I also led a simple life where i dont need proposal to be as insane as those ""ideals"" shown in drama and social media. Im also happy with engagement ring that dont cost 4 digits. A proposal tells me he wants me to be his wife, doesnt matter how much is it. An engagement ring reminds me im his fiance, doesnt matter how much it cost. Because those are just 身外物 to our love.
After that night, when we feel so much more comfortable planning for our future financially, we realised a lot more - some things can be done first and some can be done later (ie. Pre wedding and actual wedding expenses).
The amazing thing is, even though he dont earn as much, he would still want to pay for our dates from time to time not because he thinks he has extra money, but he felt those are the little gestures of love and appreciation (we do on dutch other times or just take turns paying).
Yes, money is important, but marriage is about love and commitment and so money should never be the priority.
So yes, we are happily married, done banquet dinner and did almost everything a typical couple would go through when getting married but money has never been a topic for us to quarrel about. He is also not ashamed to tell his friends and family that I paid more even though i never once try to mention it.
So now, my personal savings? Is still growing despite me spending money for marriage and wedding banquet and now we are both saving up for our new house (fortunately so far mostly paid by CPF).
Really, girls, dont ever think that because your partner is a guy, thats why he must pay half or more as a social norm. A relationship is between two person to create a nurture and not defined by the ""definition"" from friends and social media.
PS: i use a lot a lot of social media and definitely envy other couple at times, but i get even happier knowing i have a life partner like my husband.

59324,104568,"Dear OP of #104526 Does Karma Exist? If I'm not mistaken, I think I know who you are. Let me use this platform to say some stuff to you. If you aren't who I think you are, then please be comforted knowing there's another lady who went through a very similar incident as you.
I'm a friend of your ex, while I am in no position to judge, I definitely didn't agree with what he did to you. I apologize, as a man, and also on his behalf that you'd to go through so much pain. I know you, and I remember you well. The clique from 10 years ago all know you, coz of how big a deal he made it when he wooed you. Heck, your name was plastered all over our bunks coz everyone was teasing him on how smitten he was with you. Unsure if he'd ever told you, but he certainly wasn't the only one who wanted to woo you then, so please don't ever think that you are a plain jane, you are honestly far from it lah.
Readers don't flame me, I'm happily attached. Just want to remind OP of her virtues.
Anyway, I digressed.
I know of your bro's sudden death and he ditched you just shortly after the funeral. I also know you were severely traumatized because we all saw your messages to your dead bro, even years and years later on social media. I'm so sorry you all couldn't even see his body... My sincere condolences k? I hope your bro is resting in peace, and you've found some comfort within as well.
Truth is, he isn't deserving of you right from the start lah. Like some of the comments said, he wouldn't have been such a cheater if he truly loved you. While we'll never know what happened between both of you then, I repeat, what he did was truly not what a real man will do. Yes he's my friend but he's also a real jerk lah. For the level of 'love' he constantly portrayed after he got together with you showing you off, knowing that he refused your apology to the breakup during your breakdown after the funeral is really damn wtf lah. Cannot be real and grieve in front of the one you love meh? Then what does he want? For you to act all sane in front of him in such painful vulnerable moments? His reason of you being too emotional is just a bullsh*t excuse to go to that xiao3, or that he's simply too weak lah. Seriously I look down on him for this, no man should make their partner feel like they can't be themselves in front of him.
Anyway it doesn't matter how successful he and his xiao3 are, both of them are aging terribly. Got money so what? Also cannot escape aging. Please take delight in knowing their betrayal towards you are definitely creeping onto their appearances. Heck, most of us always think you look waaay prettier than her lah! Yes, even now, I just kaypoh your pics with my gf lol!
Anyway yeah I'm shallow af, but I hope this counts as some sort of karma for what they did to you k?
Heads up and focus on your future, don't waste any more of your precious youth pinning anything related to them. I assure you, a man who can text his ex years later saying he missed her *after* choosing the xiao3 will never truly love anyone except himself. That's his wife's karma, coz I bet she doesn't even know he missed you, and she bore him a child leh. Let this sink in... damn suay to be her right? Oh, I suddenly remembered, you gifted him the hella expensive boots right? I vaguely remembered you asking us his shoe size then to surprise him. Be comforted knowing he's still wearing those boots till today, we saw his photos. Seriously you wouldn't want to be his wife. You want your husband to wear the shoes his ex got him for the whole time you're with him meh? Sidenote, walao eh the boots are damn lasting sia!
You're an amazing lady for refusing to engage with his texts. I truly respect you for that, and also for all that you did for him, especially the quit smoking. Kudos to you ???????? sometimes I wish my gf care for me to this level sia lol.
Don't feel so sad anymore over him and her or their baby, really not worth it. You mentioned you have no career no money, I don't know about money lah, but aren't you in a job that many envy? My gf and I actually saw you at your work place a few times, gf even said you were radiating and she kpkb to me nonstop about how she wished to do a job that she loves too lol. I digressed again.
Don't measure your own success with their standards. With approval from my gf to say this again, you honestly are way above average of our definition of an average plain jane. There really are other men who would kill to have a gf like you, so please stop selling yourself short.
Ultimately, I just want to tell you to stop letting the poison that he fed you from 10 years ago continue to poison you further. Those who have met you and know you, know how great a girl you are. It's my friend's loss that he chose his wife, not your loss for losing someone who simply doesn't deserve you.
Shine brighter so you can watch karma do it's work. I won't be surprised if he still misses you once in a while, but too bad he's stuck with a mediocre xiao3 for the rest of his life.
Heck, my own karma is here. Gf saying I'm aging coz I'm getting so long winded.
Take care, stay pure in your heart and we hope you'll end up with a real man who sees you as his princess, someone who's a million times better than my friend.

Anyway, I'd like to think of myself as your typical nice guy and being the nice guy that I am, I always find myself bailing them out of sticky situations and digging them out of holes they really shouldn't have gotten into to begin with. The list of shit I've done for them is extensive, trust me, but the last straw came last week.
One of them called me to ask if I could fetch them back to hall after they got too drunk on their girls night out. My policy has always been to never allow drunk people into my family car but my nice-guy persona got the better of me.
Long story short, there I was driving my 4 drunk friends to hall when lo and behold, almost as if on que as part of some sick joke; THEY ALL VOMIT.

He came from a wealthy family and drove a luxury car. In contrast, I came from a low-income family that lived in a 3-room flat.
About a year later, she started texting me and even told me she broke up with her boyfriend because she misses me and wants me back. I was tempted to patch things up with her but in the end, I decided to ignore her. I later heard from her sister that she was dumped by her rich boyfriend after 9 months of dating. I also heard that her rich boyfriend cheated on her and left her for a younger and prettier girl. I thought I would feel happy that she got dumped but I actually felt sorry for her.
Today, I bumped into her when I was having a meal with my wife at a cafe. She was working at that cafe as a service crew. I wanted to say hi to her but she seemed quite unfriendly and purposely avoided me. For a moment, I looked at my wife and felt so lucky that I have found a girl who is beautiful inside and out. And I felt so relieved that I did not give my ex-girlfriend a chance when she asked me to take her back.
When I met my wife, I was still in my third year of uni. She would always offer to pay for meals despite being an average salaried worker who had to financially support her sickly father and two younger siblings. She had a few admirers who were eligible and well off but she still chose to be with me.
Knowing that I bumped into my ex-girlfriend, my wife jokingly asked me if I would ever consider going back to my ex-girlfriend. I reassured my wife and told her, ""there are plenty of pretty girls but you are the most beautiful girl because you are the only girl who has stuck with me through thick and thin. I would never ever give up such a wonderful girl like you.""
To those who have been cheated on by your partner, be thankful that you have dodged a bullet. Have faith that you will meet someone better. Most importantly, respect yourself enough to walk away from people who do not deserve you. Love yourself first and the right person will eventually come along.

53324,90790,"I would like to share my story. Back in JC a group of boys in my class would make fun of my grades. They even bet if I would retain in JC 1 (I didn’t). Only my close girl friends know but I was so depressed I tried committing suicide once because my self esteem was so poor. No matter how hard I studied I did very very badly for my A levels and went to a private Uni.
In uni I was plagued by the memory of the boys looking at me, in jest, when I collected my A level results. One of them, let’s call him Douche, said to me “judging from your expression im guessing even SIM won’t want you”. I walked to the bus stop while tears and snot dripped down my face while clenching my results.
It was these exact parting words that throughout Uni, I worked my ass of and graduated as one of the top in my cohort. After 200 or so applications I got an internship with a local bank, made some connections and secured a full time position before graduating in 2017. I admit coming into the working world, I didn’t know much. But I just knew that I never wanted to be looked down upon again.
As a girl, I had 3 years to head start my career compared to the boys. Working life wasn’t easy but I was enormously blessed to have capable and patient bosses to guide me and rose up the ranks quickly.
I’m now an assistant manager to a team of 12 working in corporate treasury, happily engaged to the love of my life I met in what many may consider “some lousy private Uni”. Today before lunch HR showed us the candidates for our SGUnited traineeship and I saw Douche’s resume. I grinned like an idiot throughout the day. Am really looking forward to our interview. 2nd upper Hons from NUS, decent testimonials and relevant internship experience, imo he stands a good chance of getting hired. And I need someone to make me coffee in the morning :))
To my JC2 self, today is the day we will end this painful yet bittersweet chapter of our lives.

48956,81283,"Male and NUS FCH graduated in 2018. Came from a crazy broken family, dad was unemployed because he just didn’t wanna be like other dads? Single working mom, $1.8k shared between me and my 2 siblings. Now i have a well paying job and have managed to have a six figure savings after long period of slowly saving up from my part time jobs since JC, NS salary and my current job! I would like to share a thing or two cause i really feel some people need to know these.
Did you know that stress is what prompts an oyster to secrete nacre (just like stress creates human ulcers) and eventually the forms a pearl? Did you know that metals go through extreme stress from heat, quenching and tempering to be made flexible, not brittle and to ensure they don’t crack under pressure and to perform tasks like being a turbine engine? Diamonds are carbon made under pressure and heat.
I took a materials engineering module once as an elective and I pondered to realise life’s challenges really are made to make you stronger and that now at work or in life, when i face difficulties, i start by saying, okay what are you preparing me for?
Because of my family background, i did alot of odd jobs. I went to Supermarkets to count stocks at 11pm and end at 6am. Yes they’re people like us. I gave tuitions during University. I worked at hotels during summer breaks, set up the buffet area at 5am and finishing work at 1pm and what really strikes me is that, there are people that are stuck doing this as a means to survive while i knew at that time i had the means to escape which was my degree. And it then taught me that at my current workplace, my technicians from India and Malaysia etc are who they are and I am who I am, an engineer only because i had the means to pursue education, and had they had the same opportunity, they would have taken my place. Those jobs, i did, taught me humility and it made me able to connect to the people on the ground. And yeah people love that and now i really have good relationships with my colleagues too.
And this is really an unpopular opinion but really you need to stop being entitled. Really the world doesn’t revolve around you. You need to suck it up. You’re not from a wealthy family, so be it. Work with what you have. In fact if you are experiencing tough times currently, keep your heads up. I am not trying to create any division but from what i can tell, tough times really build tough people. I know some friends, came from well to do family, hall paid for, no student loans, exchange paid with euro trip like nothing, but hey not all can speak in an interview with confidence... not all can connect with the ground people and not all can take scoldings from superiors without eventually giving up and changing jobs.
So if you’re having a tough time, you need to know that you’re en-route to something big... that all these hardships you’re facing, is making you flexible, less brittle, strengthening you on the inside so that cracks on the surfaces can’t propagate to break you up so easily...
And stop complaining, and be positive? Straight away find something positive when something that annoys you hit you. Example, your boss is so meticulous and so detailed that it annoys you? It’s okay!!! maybe in the future you’ll be the Head of Audit and you need that skill too.. just be crazy positive! You’re poor now? You’re juggling 2 jobs now? It’s okayyy, you will value money more and you’ll be good at savings in the future! Your house is cramped during this stay home period?? It’s okayyy, maybe in the future you’ll be parents of 5? Or because it’s cramped, you start being a minimalist and you end up saving much money in the future when you have your own house oneday! Just be positive(:
And most importantly. You need to take criticism. You need to always find what is wrong with you. And change yourself! Always change yourself. Improve, make better(: you gave it your best, and someone comments on it.. don’t be emotional.. just suck it up, take it with a pinch of salt and improve! Improve improve improve!
Alright now go my Padawans. Live long and prosper. See what i just did there? Lol

58998,103920,"A father said to his daughter, ""You just graduated, this is a car I bought a while ago... It is a few years old. But before I give it, take it to a car dealer in the city and sell it , see how much they offer.”
The girl came back to her father and said: ""They offered 1000 euros because it looks very old""
The father said: Hold it and take it to the 2nd hand car dealer.
The girl returns to her father and says: ""The pawn shop offered 100 euros because it is a very old car and lots of investments are needed to drive it again""
The father asked his daughter to join a passionate car club with experts and show them the car.
The girl drove the car to the passionate car club, turned and said to her father: “Some people in the club offered me 100,000 euros because it is a rare car that is in good condition, with great capabilities and super difficult to find.”
Then the father said, ""I wanted to let you know that you are not worth anything if you are not in the right place.""
If you are not appreciated, do not be angry, that means you are in the wrong place. ""Don't stay in a place where no one sees your value.

3730,5186,"I come from a broken family. I live in a small rental flat with my mum. My dad died five years ago but I don’t miss him or grieve for him. He was an abusive father and husband, and to this day, I still hate him.
I remembered the times when I was a young boy. My mother would hide me in her room as I listened, from the other side of the door, her screams. The abuse became less common in my teenage years when he realised that I wasn’t going to take his shit and that I wouldn’t hesitant to beat him if he landed a finger on either one of us.
When he died, I’ve never felt more happy. I owe him my thanks for putting me in this world but that is about it. My mum, on the other hand, is everything to me. Despite the struggles, she gave me two of the greatest gifts in the world: a mother’s love, and hope in the form of the written word. My childhood was filled with secondhand books. Novels gave me sanity and an imaginary world where I could escape into.
I’ve been out of NUS for two years now. I did brilliantly in school, graduating with a good honours degree and was even offered an opportunity to do my PhD but didn’t due to other pressing priorities in my life. I landed a job I truly love upon graduation. It's long hours but that, on the grander scheme of things, doesn’t matter much. I’ve benefited from the education system having had access to good teachers, resources and financial assistance.
Now I give back my time freely as a private tutor for some of the kids in my neighbourhood. Kids who come from broken families like mine. I teach four teenagers every Sunday morning in my flat. Sometimes, they turn up; other times, they don’t. This morning, one of my kids - a young, smart and talented Chinese boy - turned up after having been missing from class for the last six weekends.
He passed me a note at the end of the lesson, telling me the reason why he hasn’t been to class. His mum was recently sent for drug rehab. At the end of the short note, he wrote, “You give me hope that my life will sum to something greater than it is now. Thank you for teaching me.” That was the most defining moment for me as a tutor to know that I’ve impacted their lives in small ways. That was the best birthday present for me and it gave me affirmation that I should seriously consider becoming a full-time teacher eventually in my career.
