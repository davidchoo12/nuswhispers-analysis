59741,105341,"I would like to share my eye opening experiences for the last six months working as a casual worker and the state of how said group of labourers are perceived.
Background info: I come from a privileged background and work for my family business for the last ten years or so after graduation. I haven't been exposed to much hardship with the exception of National Service and a bit of racism in my studies abroad. About 9 months ago, I had a major tiff with my family regarding the direction of our business and we decided that it would be better for me to take time off to collect myself and find my way. It was fun at first to bum around but it got boring quickly.
I read quite a bit and was awed by Einstein's experience as a patent clerk giving him new perspectives and decided to do something similar. I decided to take on any form of casual jobs for half a year with little to no commitment (so I can have the largest possible variety) - my shortest stint was one day and my longest was two weeks.
I gave myself a couple of rules to follow - no using of my car, limiting my spending to 20% of my daily wage, and not to quit no matter bad or tough the job was.
I found these jobs on FaceBook - a cornancopia of opportunities in various casual job groups.
I have worked as a food delivery rider, parcel delivery staff, pet transporter, mover, flyer distributor, general cleaner, IT crew, fishmonger, metalwork crew, AV crew, F&B staff, bar hand, food packer, warehouse operator, aeroplane cleaner, valet driver, durian opener, and a few more jobs.
It has been an eye opening experience working. The main things I noticed is that a good percentage of locals adopt an elitist mentality. Unfortunately, my family is guilty of this and to some extent, I too was. Most are very judgemental of blue collared workers and this is very prevalent in the F&B industry.
Toughest job: Metalwork crew. I had to cut metal objects to salvage profitable parts and it was extremely dangerous with sparks flying and a very dirty environment.
Most enjoyable job: Fishmonger. This was by far one of the most fun I had working as I learned to scale and cut different types of fish. It was also very interesting to work at the fisheries to see all sorts of fish(small ones to huge ones almost half a tonne).
Most interesting job: Valet driver, I witnessed plenty of older married men needing to be sent home/hotels with much younger women. Some of the dross these men say/do with their women in the car have definitely left a mark on me.
Most boring job: Warehouse operator, pretty mundane with too much repetition.
My experience as a bar hand watching guys trying to impress their dates is quite hilarious - I notice guys love to flaunt their wealth when it isn't really great in the grand scheme of things. They tend to treat the bar hands and service staff like crap to look more alpha I'm guessing? Terrible viewing.
Other 'interesting' experience include deliverying parcels to women who receive them not wearing underwear and being pretty nonchalant about it.
Distributing flyers/assisting and moving furniture from showflats to showflats for realtors was a jaded affair - I notice they tend to spew a lot of drivel to the prospective clients with little to no real knowledge about investments as a whole and only seem to care about making a quick buck. Males tend to be nicer to us, offering to buy food if we had worked the whole day without breaks. Females tend to be a bit more picky about not wasting flyers on seemingly unqualified prospects - very judgemental.
Working as an IT crew for tuition centres was pretty sad - I realised a lot of tutors are not really proficient and pretty much reading off their notes. I even noticed a few making mistakes in their lessons - quite alarming.
Cleaning flats and offices was.. peculiar. Some flats were really disgusting and I could not believe people are capable of being so gross and not able to pick up after themselves. Especially tenants moving out, woah. Some flat owners were really nice with isotonic drinks and snacks but the office ones were generally curt and snobbish. A typical HR who was in charge of us(usually middle age woman) would treat us as lesser beings and treat us as such.
Generally, people are quite condescending about lower waged workers and I even saw a few former JC mates brushing me off or being unnecessarily difficult in my experience in F&B. Thankfully, with the mandatory mask, I was never once recognised or questioned. I hope we will be a bit more gracious to people of all sorts of life - no one deserves to be belittled.
Transporting pets was truly amazing, I learned so much how the shelters are in need of help and how these animals truly need our help.
Overall, I made about $12000(close to $10/hour) in these six months and after my daily food and transportation expenses I had about $9000. I have donated this amount to the few shelters and will continue to do so.
I have learned so much for these six months that will echo for the rest of my life and have realigned my perspectives of how I should look at people and my family's firm.
A good two weeks break to decompress and time to get back to bringing our business forward and being a positive member of society.
AMA and I will do my best to reply in a follow-up post.
Always choose to be kind and gracious, it costs nothing.

59762,105386,"I accidentally left my iphone on a bus on the way to school. By the time I realized, I borrowed a phone from one of my friends to call home for help as my lesson was starting. As I waited in panic, I couldn't concentrate as the lecture began. There goes my phone. Parents are going to be mad at me etc.
During a break, I checked home and my mum told me the person who answered my phone will make arrangements through my friend's number to return me by end of the school day. I was skeptical if the person would actually show up but I kept my hopes up.
I still have lessons so my friend waited at the agreed time and place to collect my phone on my behalf. My friend did managed to meet the guy who picked up my phone and got it back for me. What a relief!
Come evening the revelations of not recovering my phone became real and I felt compelled to reward him so I texted the guy that I really wish to reward him or at least a lunch treat as thanks as I didn't even get to meet him. He declined twice even after my mum insisted and he told me...
""I have a young son. One day if my son loses his phone, I wish someone would return his phone too. There's no need to reward me or anything. Pay it forward.""
Now whenever I see someone do good without wanting anything in return, I will be reminded of this man. His son is lucky to have him as a father. Thank you sir!

58626,103214,"I dated a poor guy. We were both from NUS, graduated so in love and very much I n debt. Blame that on the student loans we had to take. Our dates were mostly hunting for cheap and good hawker food, cooking at home, going shopping in neighbourhood markets, streaming movies online and cuddling. We didn't celebrate anniversaries, partly because he couldn't afford and always refused to have me pay for everything, but mostly as we didn't bother to remember the dates. For everyday we were together in the past years was special and I would not trade my days with him for any gold or diamonds. I love my poor boyfriend, except now that he has becomed my debt-free/start-up owner/decent income earner/still extremely hot fianc√©e. We still don't celebrate anniversaries, and we still go hunting for cheap deals. He still opens the door for me, pulls out chairs and tells me he loves me everyday. We just bought our first home together in a pretty condo (missed the HDB income ceiling by a few thousands) and are expecting our first baby in a few months time. Girls, believe in your men.

59355,104605,"There I was having dinner with my son when I notice them. A couple sitting near us. Both of them glued to their phones minding their own business while munching their food. Zero interaction.
My first impression with them was harsh. ""Going out on a date and still on their phones? What's the point?"" Then suddenly the boy show the girl something on the phone and the girl responded with a smile.
I notice the guy's dressing. Tee shirt with some anime characters, jeans. He is a typical geeky looking guy. No toned muscles or good physic, thick glasses, abit messy hair. He definately didn't work out or groom himself much. A typical guy that look like he spend alot of time indoors.
The girl? Typical nerdy girl. Golden specs, ponytail. Wearing light color sleeved tee shirt and mid length shorts. Neat socks and shoes. She is not gorgeous and make-up looks minimal. No guys will give her a 2nd look.
I can see both of them with their shopping bags, from a nearby shop selling Japanese anime novelties and toys. I concluded they like watching anime and reading mangas.
The guy is explaining or discussing something to the girl. I hear it's something about some anime series. The boy got very technical, sharing the plot, the character and whatnot. He basically geeked out in his conversation. If he is talking to normal folks, everyone would be bored to death.
But the girl, she is listening intentively. I can see she is engaging and her eyes glittering. She is enjoying the conversation.
There they are, enjoying each other's company yet take breaks in between while checking out their phones. I realised this is how introverts communicate. They need their own space but also enjoy other's company, as long as their space is maintained.
They were very cute in my eyes. This also prove that anyone deserves love regardless if your looks or your hobbies. I hope their relationship continue to flourish and go further. To prove that even nerds or plain looking people can find love.

Anyway we were walking up a flight of stairs and a lady and her 4/5 year old child walking down. My first instinct was 'should I let go of his hand' because some parents think their child can catch the gay by seeing two guys hold hands or whatever. But to our surprised she actually smiled and gave us a thumbs up. My boyfriend was so touched afterwards and it really brightened our day.

59324,104568,"Dear OP of #104526 Does Karma Exist? If I'm not mistaken, I think I know who you are. Let me use this platform to say some stuff to you. If you aren't who I think you are, then please be comforted knowing there's another lady who went through a very similar incident as you.
I'm a friend of your ex, while I am in no position to judge, I definitely didn't agree with what he did to you. I apologize, as a man, and also on his behalf that you'd to go through so much pain. I know you, and I remember you well. The clique from 10 years ago all know you, coz of how big a deal he made it when he wooed you. Heck, your name was plastered all over our bunks coz everyone was teasing him on how smitten he was with you. Unsure if he'd ever told you, but he certainly wasn't the only one who wanted to woo you then, so please don't ever think that you are a plain jane, you are honestly far from it lah.
Readers don't flame me, I'm happily attached. Just want to remind OP of her virtues.
Anyway, I digressed.
I know of your bro's sudden death and he ditched you just shortly after the funeral. I also know you were severely traumatized because we all saw your messages to your dead bro, even years and years later on social media. I'm so sorry you all couldn't even see his body... My sincere condolences k? I hope your bro is resting in peace, and you've found some comfort within as well.
Truth is, he isn't deserving of you right from the start lah. Like some of the comments said, he wouldn't have been such a cheater if he truly loved you. While we'll never know what happened between both of you then, I repeat, what he did was truly not what a real man will do. Yes he's my friend but he's also a real jerk lah. For the level of 'love' he constantly portrayed after he got together with you showing you off, knowing that he refused your apology to the breakup during your breakdown after the funeral is really damn wtf lah. Cannot be real and grieve in front of the one you love meh? Then what does he want? For you to act all sane in front of him in such painful vulnerable moments? His reason of you being too emotional is just a bullsh*t excuse to go to that xiao3, or that he's simply too weak lah. Seriously I look down on him for this, no man should make their partner feel like they can't be themselves in front of him.
Anyway it doesn't matter how successful he and his xiao3 are, both of them are aging terribly. Got money so what? Also cannot escape aging. Please take delight in knowing their betrayal towards you are definitely creeping onto their appearances. Heck, most of us always think you look waaay prettier than her lah! Yes, even now, I just kaypoh your pics with my gf lol!
Anyway yeah I'm shallow af, but I hope this counts as some sort of karma for what they did to you k?
Heads up and focus on your future, don't waste any more of your precious youth pinning anything related to them. I assure you, a man who can text his ex years later saying he missed her *after* choosing the xiao3 will never truly love anyone except himself. That's his wife's karma, coz I bet she doesn't even know he missed you, and she bore him a child leh. Let this sink in... damn suay to be her right? Oh, I suddenly remembered, you gifted him the hella expensive boots right? I vaguely remembered you asking us his shoe size then to surprise him. Be comforted knowing he's still wearing those boots till today, we saw his photos. Seriously you wouldn't want to be his wife. You want your husband to wear the shoes his ex got him for the whole time you're with him meh? Sidenote, walao eh the boots are damn lasting sia!
You're an amazing lady for refusing to engage with his texts. I truly respect you for that, and also for all that you did for him, especially the quit smoking. Kudos to you ???????? sometimes I wish my gf care for me to this level sia lol.
Don't feel so sad anymore over him and her or their baby, really not worth it. You mentioned you have no career no money, I don't know about money lah, but aren't you in a job that many envy? My gf and I actually saw you at your work place a few times, gf even said you were radiating and she kpkb to me nonstop about how she wished to do a job that she loves too lol. I digressed again.
Don't measure your own success with their standards. With approval from my gf to say this again, you honestly are way above average of our definition of an average plain jane. There really are other men who would kill to have a gf like you, so please stop selling yourself short.
Ultimately, I just want to tell you to stop letting the poison that he fed you from 10 years ago continue to poison you further. Those who have met you and know you, know how great a girl you are. It's my friend's loss that he chose his wife, not your loss for losing someone who simply doesn't deserve you.
Shine brighter so you can watch karma do it's work. I won't be surprised if he still misses you once in a while, but too bad he's stuck with a mediocre xiao3 for the rest of his life.
Heck, my own karma is here. Gf saying I'm aging coz I'm getting so long winded.
Take care, stay pure in your heart and we hope you'll end up with a real man who sees you as his princess, someone who's a million times better than my friend.

58965,103843,"To OP #103823 I was like you 25 years ago and truly understand what is like living paycheck to paycheck.
I gave up my poly study at year 2 and work as a teller cos I couldn‚Äôt bear my younger brothers being affected my my family situation and they couldn‚Äôt concentrate on their studies. So I chose to work to support my parents and siblings.
No one will understand how it is like when your friends need not bat an eyelid on Starbucks but you have to refund EZ-Link card to use the money to buy dinner for the family cos your payday is on the next day and will credit in midnight.
My husband (back then still boyfriend) never once say anything or complain. But he was equally poor???? staying in an one-room rented flat. We saved every single cent, dates were usually at hawkers or foodcourt. We held our wedding dinner at a Chinese restaurant and even ‚Äòearn‚Äô back our dinner cost with money for overseas honeymoon.
Now with 2 kids and staying comfortably in a 4-room HDB flat, combined income still below $10k, we never once feel ‚Äòinferior‚Äô as compared to our peers. We are ‚Äòdebt free‚Äô as our cpf have surplus to cover the housing loan monthly. We have no car, no condo, restaurant meals seldom exceeded $80 for fam of 4 but we are contented.
Our nights are spent chasing dramas on the bed, no drinking at pubs, no cafe hopping as all these are $$$$ and $$$. Kids during their free time, play bubble guns at the corridor, Nintendo switch and mobile games. All these activities really no need much money but still keep us occupied.
Guess god ‚Äòcompensate‚Äô my hard life by giving me a good husband albeit we are defined as ‚Äòpoor‚Äô in today‚Äôs context. So the question you really have to ask yourself is whether u love your boyfriend and if he is the right person who you can depend on for the next 30 years. Some may have the rich boyfriend/hubby but still unhappiness over 3rd party or debt issues.

59036,104015,"This is my mid-career switch experience from teaching to software engineering. If you are thinking of doing the same, I hope my post would help you in some ways. Long story ahead.
I graduated from NIE with a bachelor in arts degree and was bonded to MOE for four years. During my four years of teaching, I gave my all and was performing above average. However, I always knew I wanted to try something else besides teaching. At that time, I didn't know what the alternative was but I just couldn't see myself in teaching for the rest of my life. Towards the end of my four years bond, I wrote my resume and applied to various job adverts on LinkedIn. I was lucky as one of the companies replied me. While I didn't have the necessary skills they needed, I promoted myself as someone willing to learn and keened to work for the company. I was prepared to take a pay cut as I knew I was starting from scratch again. I settled for a 40% pay cut for this new job.
Unfortunately, things didn't work out well for me as I found the job to be rather mundane. I knew I wouldn't get anywhere with the skills from this job and decided to cut loss by ending my employment with the company at the end of my probation period.
The good thing that came out of this was I realized I wanted to work in an environment where there would be minimal face-to-face interaction and it should be stimulating enough for me. During that period, SkillsFuture was encouraging people to join the IT industry and they were promoting this professional conversion programme for mid-career switchers to train them in IT programming. I decided to go for it. At the same time, I made use of my $500 skillsfuture credit to purchase programming courses on Udemy and continued with my learning at home.
To be honest, the courses provided by the training institute were insufficient. I was expected to learn OOP, MVC programming in 5 days, which was just impossible for someone like me without any programming background. But I was determined to figure it out. So when I was not in class, I would be following my Udemy instructor and learning on my own. The entire conversion programme took around 6 months. I updated my resume with a few mini projects I did and began my job search process. In total, I applied to close to 100 job applications and only heard back from 4 of them. I still remember the agony I went through to this day. You must understand teachers have it easy when it comes to getting a job. Our jobs were handed to us even before we graduated. We didn't have to go through this excruciating job searching process and I was jobless for more than half a year. All the self-doubt, anxiousness and negative thoughts were just eating me up every night. While waiting to hear back from the companies, I practised my interviewing skills, did leetcode, continued with my Udemy courses and prayed. I also gave part-time tuition during this period to help with my daily expenses.
After being unemployed for more than 7 months, my breakthrough came. My friend referred me to their company's HR internally. I was given an opportunity to do an online technical test which I passed and was subsequently interviewed by the project manager and MD. What helped was the mini projects I did and knowing the basics of OOP. They extended an offer to me and this ended my 8 months drought. I was drawing a fresh grad pay. It was 20% higher than my last drawn pay. While it was still lower than what I was last drawing in teaching, the opportunity to work and learn in this industry was more important than the salary. I knew I had to be humble and learn from my colleagues who were all younger than me.
The learning curve was steep but I enjoyed every part of it. I'm coming to 3 years in this industry and in these 3 years, I attained two cloud solutions architect associate certifications and was promoted to a senior position. I burnt many nights and weekends away studying and upskilling myself in new technologies.
Looking back, leaving teaching was a leap of faith. With a degree in arts and four years of work experience only in teaching, it was really difficult to find something comparable in the commercial sector. To those who are thinking of leaving teaching or even joining the IT industry, I would advise that you try out those programming courses on Udemy first during after office hours and weekends. It'll minimally take you 3 months to figure out what you are doing. But you must persevere. Rewatch the videos until you get it. Figure out if this is for you. Most of the udemy courses will teach you by building projects. Make changes to those projects and customize them so that you can show them in your resume. If you plan to go for the diplomas or certifications provided by higher-level institutes, make sure you have enough savings to do so. Even if you don't plan to, you should also make sure you have enough savings for your expenses in case you need to settle for a pay cut. Those in teaching, at least leave after you've collected your 4 years connect plan.
I got headhunted by another company during this recent tech hiring spree with a happy increment. I'm now drawing a salary higher than what I would be getting if I were to stay in teaching. Most importantly, I'm doing something I can see myself doing till my retirement. Was it scary? You bet. But I grew so much in these three years when I chose to leave my comfort zone and I'm glad I made that decision 4 years ago. Oh, and not to forget the benefits of working from home.
To those who choose to stay in teaching, I have nothing but admiration for all of you. The working hours are tough and there is no such thing as work-life balance. You are a teacher to your students 24/7. Thank you! To those who need a way out, maybe this could be an option for you to consider. All the best!

58807,103530,"tl;dr: I cheated with my female colleague and I feel very bad about it. What made it worse was that my wife witnessed the cheating‚Ä¶
I'm happily married with a wonderful wife with two kids. I work in marketing in an FMCG company and I'm constantly surrounded by younger female colleagues. Ngl, many of them are very attractive but I'm a faithful man who thinks with his bigger head.
However my life recently turned upside down. There's this female colleague who recently joined, let's call her G. G is in her late twenties and has a face and figure many women would die for and many men would go for. I was so surprised to find out that she was single (she gave me that information without me asking). G would constantly ask me for advice dealing with work matters and invite me to go lunch together with her batch. Sometimes we go for lunches and it's just the two of us. G would constantly ask me what I was doing over the weekend and tell me what her plans were. She was actively using dating apps but none of the guys were up to her standards. She would often flirt with me (I think?) Like when we are alone she would playfully brush my arms and sometimes bump into me (too often for it to be by accident). She‚Äôd also tell me about her experiences with her dates and how they're not good, and I'm so much better. I always felt a weird sensation whenever I hear that from her. It‚Äôs a nice feeling to be validated, but I‚Äôm married and it feels wrong.
One fateful day, as my wife had to use the car that day, she came to my office to pick me up. As I was walking away from the office with my wife, G somehow appeared out of nowhere and said hi to us and was extremely friendly towards my wife. G and my wife started chatting as if they were besties and they somehow ended up organizing a games night at my place that weekend. G said she‚Äôd bring her date over.
Fast forward to that day, G came with her date. Not sure why but I felt a tinge of jealousy seeing him. We decided to play some card games and I ended up partnering with G. This is when things went down. G was secretly texting me the cards she had in her hand and signaled me to read my phone. I got the hint and was trying to discreetly look at my phone. However, my wife caught me doing that and snatched my phone away and she saw the message from G. She acted like it was ok but after G and date left, she was so furious that I cheated with G during the games and my wife refuses to talk to me now.
How can I appease my wife?

59072,104063,"Tl;Dr - most people who have children, don't seem to fully understand what they are getting into.
As I am at the age where most of my friends are married and having children/had children, many around me have started to ask why is my wife and I not having any yet.
The answer is simple. Unless you truly want to have children, and you want to devote your time towards nurturing a child, you should not have children. This answer often makes people around me uncomfortable as it seems like it is a direct jab at their life choices.
Many around us tend to have children simply because it seems to be the ""next step in life"". Or perhaps as some form of insurance against old age as they may have a child or two to care for them as they age. Sure, these are valid reasons as long as you nurture and love your children.
But this is where it all goes downhill. Where parents only want to enjoy the fun parts of parenting, and dump the rest to everyone and everything else around them.
Instead of spending quality time educating and nurturing the child, many young parents like to whip out the iPad so the child can go on ""autopilot"" mode and they can use their mobile phones or computers in peace. The amount of actual human interaction that the child receives is what helps to nurture and allow the child to grow as an intellectual.
Children are brought to the world by their parents and if their own parents don't even want to spend time with them, then what kind of a childhood are these children going to go through? It takes a lot of real love and patience to really nurture a human being, and it simply cannot be reduced to 30 minutes of interaction spread across a day. Let alone treating your ""insurance"" as a side piece.
After years and years of watching how people can say things like ""Parenthood is the best thing that can happen to you"" or ""the sacrifice is all worth it"" while whipping out the iPad at the dinner table for their child and blasting Baby Shark while the domestic helper attempts to feed the child, I've come to the conclusion that it is no easy feat being a parent. A true parent, not a sperm donor or egg incubator.
I know that this post will likely not make any difference, but I would like to suggest to couples that are considering to have children, to really understand what you are getting yourselves into. Should you choose to embark on the journey of Parenthood, I applaud you and sincerely hope you nurture a good and responsible human being to be part of our society.

58625,103217,"I am a freshmen in NUS. My father works as a roadside cleaner while my mother cleans houses. I have never been ashamed to tell my friends what my parents do for a living for it is after all an honest living regardless of the job scope. In fact, I am grateful for my parents for despite their low incomes they have never failed to provide for both my sisters and I. At first glance, you would never assume that I came from a low-income family because I carry an iPhone and dress decently from labels like H&M and Zara. Yes it is difficult, having to take on part-time jobs (currently taking on 2 part-time jobs) all my life but I do not complain for my parents are my motivation to continue to push through the demands of both school and work. Being in NUS means the world for me as it brings me one step closer to earning a stable income and ridding my family from poverty. I guess through this post, I hope to inspire others out there who are having a hard time now. Find your motivation. Find that light at the end of the tunnel, the rainbow after a storm and before you know it, giving up would never be an option. Nobody said that this was easy but it definitely helps to have a support system so strong you never feel alone.

We managed to finish the durians, (the durians were so good)

59373,104628,"I am a saver and I use delayed gratification method. I hope to inspire others to save.
I came from a humble background. My father distributes newspaper, holds a F&B job and another F&B job at night. He also picks up items like a garang uni and I enjoyed second hand clothes, furnitures etc since young.
As a result, I become a saver.
I made most of my decision base on dollar and cents. Most of my clothes are recycled items. I choose food from the menu base on price.
Before I entered NUS, I worked part time and even on public holidays to get double pay.
I managed to go on exchange programme with grants and didnt pay anything as I receieved grant.
I also borrowed books from library and photocopied them with my company's photocopying machine when I was on night shift.
I also sold my books and projects after every semster.
I managed to save and pay off my study loan before I graduated.
When I started the work force, my starting pay was $2700. Then, financial crisis hit and it dropped to $2500. I worked for under 3k pay for the next 3 years before I became self employed.
As a self employed, I earned about $10k to $15k a month. I saved and managed to get my BTO fully paid before I reach my MOP. I also paid for my car with cash. We chose the cheapest but new car.
When my wallet got fatter, I walked into branded shops and tried to buy one of the branded items. I looked at the price and felt disgusted, and I walked off. Paying such a high price for these items doesnt make sense for me.
I continued to stay with my in laws.
When I become a parent, I got recycled items for my children. I almost didnt buy any clothes, same for myself.
Then in my mid 30s, I realised I have saved almost $1m, mostly in cash. With that, I purchased a freehold landed property.
I continued to stay with my in laws.
I leased out the property, finding tenant to finance my mortgage. I am now saving up for a second property.
Once I get my second property, I will move to my landed and find more assets to buy.
This is my story. From garang guni to landed. I hope everyone can start saving.

59017,103962,"To #103947
I'm a stay home mum in my mid 30s, my husband's income is about $12k, which I consider substantial. Being pragmatic and frugal by nature allows us to sustain this single income lifestyle where I can stay home w the kid. We don't need alot of things to be happy and so don't see a need to chase material things that add to stress.
We currently stay in a 3rm HDB and are moving to 5rm since baby #2 is coming in Oct, so we need more bedrooms.
At the start of our house hunting journey, I honestly felt like you too! Because our income was not low, we didn't qualify for subsidy.
We're also not well off enough to afford private housing comfortably without stressing about monthly instalments. Private housing is out of the qn for us in the foreseeable years because I don't want to put extra stress on my husband and we also see no need to stay private. I think it's the inside of the house that matters, not the outside, since we spend most of the time at home, not in the function room or swimming pool.
When choosing our new 5rm resale flat, our key considerations were location, to be close to extended family. But that meant we had to continue to stay in mature estate where HDB prices are crazy. 5rm or EA flats around the area is at least $700-$800k onwards..
Both of us didn't want to pay this much for a 99yr lease. As we are also skeptical how much we'll be able to sell it for in future.
So to combat this, we looked at older units and low floor. It helped that my husband prefers low floor, and I liked that older units are bigger.
After more than 15 viewings, and months scrolling on propertyguru, we finally found a flat from 1970s, 5rm, mature estate, low floor, at less than $600k, with a greenery view at the balcony.
I think it's entirely possible to find something comfortable within your budget so that u don't have to postpone plans just to save up for that ideal property at sky high prices.. You just have to go for many many viewings, so that u can find something that's acceptable to both of u.
If you would like advice, don't let housing or lack of push back your marriage plans. My big regret is not having kids earlier. I had my first baby at 33. Second one is coming in a few months at 35. I feel tired and old already.. But we still want to try for baby #3, as my husband and I are both only children so we know it gets lonely.
My husband and I got married in our late 20s. At that time he was still studying, but we didn't want to wait for BTO and too broke to buy resale. So we rented a 1 bedroom condo at $1.5k per month, which was very affordable. But that was the rental market years ago, i don't know what it is like now. Maybe u can consider renting a cheap / affordable place in the meantime to start settling down.. After 1yr rental, my husband graduated and we bought our first 3rm resale flat and have stayed here till now.
We also didn't have a lavish wedding/ proposal / diamond ring. We don't see the need for all these. So it also helped to save money and put it into longer term things..
However, I do have to agree with u about renovation costs! Now that I'm embarking on the reno journey myself, prices are crazy.
Because our new flat is so old, we really can't keep anything. It needs a complete redo of floor tiles, electrical, lighting, toilets, kitchen.. Really everything. We're not even looking at elaborate carpentry or anything very fancy, our 3 quotes have come back ranging from $75k- $120k. And this is just renovation cost, not including appliances, aircon and furniture!
I find this really unbelievable. I'm still persevering to find more reasonable quotes. I will not spend $100k on reno, it's crazy. I think $60k is probably our max, but we haven't found that yet, still working on it...
Good luck to you on your house hunting. Don't give up on HDB, not everything is $1mil.. $1mil is usually for penthouse unit but do you really need that to be happy? Take time to find, you'll surely find something you both like.
Also, your first house likely won't be your last. So don't need to go all the way to $1mil immediately. Because it's the first time you will be staying on your own, there's alot of things you will need to experience to know if you will actually like it.. So no need to max out on your first home yet.
Like for us, we were so noob choosing our first hdb, we only went to view in the night after work. So we didn't know it was so dark. It doesn't have natural light coming in as it is blocked by opposite block and is a corridor unit so I even have to turn on lights in the day!
But we'll chalk it down to first timer mistake. So for all our subsequent houses, we know clearly what we want / can live with and what we absolutely cannot and we're able to make better decisions..
One last thought, maybe don't go private la, i imagine it must be very stressful to carry such a big loan on your shoulders at this early stage, esp if u say both of you have not much savings yet . But that's just me.

58900,103714,"I fell for a Siam bu.
Before u guys judge me, please hear me out. I often frequent Thai disco / Siam Diu as a means to de-stress. I find that the loud music and spinning lights help take the stress away from my work.
Like any other visit, I sat at my usual spot when a petite silhouette from afar caught my attention. Her round eyes, sharp nose, and elongated legs is what many would consider ""attractive"". Not to mention that her long and silky hair that is constantly brushing against her shoulder line; any man would subconsciously gravitate toward her and I was no exception.
I could not help but to glance in her direction without making it too obvious. I got caught eventually and we exchanged eye contact for a good 10 seconds. She understood the assignment and came over for a chat. As we began sharing more about each other, I realized that we have many things in common. We immediately clicked as though we had known each other right from the beginning. She introduced herself as ""Moon.""
At that moment, I felt as though I had found my soulmate. Talking to Moon made me forget about my fatigue from work. It was as though time had stopped. Deep down, I was sincerely hoping that the conversation could last forever. Time flew quickly, and before I knew it, the place was closing for the night. We exchanged contact and parted ways.
The next day, my phone rang. On answering, I was greeted by a familiar voice. It was Moon. My face lit up knowing that I could connect with her again. We agreed to meet up at a Thai restaurant called NaNa at Golden mille.
NaNa restaurant is a famous Thai restaurant in SG. Moon claimed to be a frequent patron of the place as their food tasted close to home. She even use the opportunity to teach me the name of the dishes in Thai. Halfway through our meal, she was rudely interrupted by a phone call which led her to leaving the restaurant. She claimed that she had something urgent to attend to, and needed to excuse herself. She sounded anxious.
Feeling concerned, I quickly paid the tab and followed her. I was soon led to one of the floor exits where I found her seated on the stairs and sobbing uncontrollably. I approached her to check on her. My presence caught her off guard and, almost immediately, she apologized for leaving me alone in the restaurant. She then went on to explain what happened. Turns out, her mom was terminally ill, and needed money for her operation. Sympathizing with her plight, I agreed to help her out without much hesitation.
As I was about to get up and make the withdrawal. She grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her. She gave me a peck on my cheek to express her gratitude. Things got heated up and we made love in a public space. Despite the shabby location, the sex was good and memorable. The day ended on a good note with her settling her family matters with my financial support.
That incident pulled us closer as we started hanging out more. Despite numerous warnings from my friends and family about her intention, I chose to believe her as I felt that the society perception towards hostress is based on stereotypes. Things, however, did get dubious when she started asking for more money...
P.S I realized the story is getting too lengthy and I apologized. I'll split the story and post the part two if the post hits 200 likes

57879,101745,"I am married twice and I have learnt so much about maintaining a marriage from a woman's POV.
1st marriage, I was young and over zealous about being a good wife and living a good marriage. We were a horrible match, but I believed I could make it work. There was always a need to prove to everyone that I made the right choice.
I did everything that social media would deem as the perfect woman - including cook, clean, work, bring home money, plan, love his family, do home improvement projects, romance the husband, keep up with the s** and whatever you can think of. Eventually I got burnt out and he took me for granted. Can I blame him? Yes but I am also to blame because I made him into who he is.
He hated my guts because I was so good. He criticised me because he hated the compliments I got. He hated it when I see his friends because I stole his limelight. He didn't need to do anything because his wife could do everything. In my POV, I was just trying to be the best for him but in his POV, I was putting him down in every way. So like most marriage tragedies, he cheated on me with a woman who was so ordinary, so ordinary that it opened my eyes completely. I had been working blindly to become what I thought is a good woman - but was it for him? Or was it just for my own ego? I went through a phase of blaming and hating on him because I was self righteous about being the best - and yet I was hurt so badly. But now I am thankful because that failed marriage has taught me so much.
My current marriage made me realise that if you meet the right person, you don't even need to try so hard or work so hard. We know each other's strengths and we give each other space. Of course we have days when we are just pissed at each other but we choose our battles. I have the brains and he has the muscles so I do most of family and kids planning while he does the physical labor like cleaning and fixing. He will play his games and watch his sports but still be responsible for the chores at home. I go out partying with my girlfriends but still return home to be a good partner the next day. We respect each other's activities and hobbies. We are always verbal about our appreciation for one another. It is harmonious and great for the kids because I see them growing up being good people.
The biggest lesson I learnt is that - if you have issues with a man before marriage, don't marry him, wait for the one who makes you feel good about yourself and brings out the best of you. The right man will not hurt you and will appreciate you for what you have. It will hurt him to hurt you. You don't have to try to make things work, it will just work. When you realise you are trying too hard, something is very wrong!

59377,104647,"Since the academic year is starting and it has been 10 years since I left college, I wanted to share some advice from a spur of nostalgia. My advice is targeted at those who're interested in startups - I've built two companies in the mid-9 figures, exited one of them.
(A) Startups and your major
1. You've heard that execution is more important than the idea. This is untrue. To be more correct, I'd say: conditioned on having an idea, the execution is more important than the idea. It's easy to learn execution, but it's hard to learn how to come up with ideas.
2. There're two classic ways to come up with an idea. One is to throw many lean ideas on the ceiling and see what sticks. The other is to have experienced a problem and know the pain point yourself. The second is much better. But it requires you to have domain expertise in some niche.
3. It's hard to optimize for expertise, but it's easy to set constraints on the niche. A corollary is that it's harder to be successful in a field that's popular (CS, law, medicine) because the competition widens the niche. Another result is that rather than focusing on being the best in your major, it's easier to focus on being the best at some niche smaller than your major.
For me, that was math. Math's a niche by virtue of its unpopularity. But I was only top 250-500 at math (Putnam score). Where I had my real niche was that I was probably fastest 3-5 in the world at transcribing a math lecture live in LaTeX. LaTeX and math gave me my first investor check, because I knew how to typeset legal agreements and syntax in a way that got every most top 50 law firms interested. And though I later pivoted (and that's where execution came into play), that first check gave me the first break in life.
(B) Life hacks
4. Four of the strongest predictors of success are (i) the social circle that you spend 80% of your time with, (ii) how fast you can compound the benefits of learning, (iii) how many decisions you can make in a typical week, (iv) skepticism. There's a selection bias for these, so take these with a grain of salt.
For (i), you'll have already spent most of your time with your best friends by the middle of university, and the frequency that you'll meet them will decrease thereafter. Don't be too attached to them at the expense of your career, and be quick to cut out bad influences. Success will cause you to outgrow some friends.
As for (ii), the more successful you become, the more likely you are to be promoted away from what you were good at or put yourself out of your original job, so you need to be able to learn quickly to overcome this gradient, or your career will plateau.
The early phases of a startup will require you to orchestrate hundreds of decisions per day. The late stages will require you make a handful of good decisions per day. I aggressively cut down my decision fatigue by outsourcing or delegating as much work as possible. This was expensive and not for everyone; I had less than $5k cash in the bank for years while I was a paper millionaire. Also, there's a relation between (ii) and (iii). The less decision fatigue you have, the more time you have to spend on learning.
As for (iv), the world's replete with ways to drain your money (bad) and time (worse). Discipline will help you avoid the obvious 80% of these, but skepticism will save you from the remaining 20% which are much more expensive. This includes wealth advisors at large bank PWMs, people trying to sell you a $M+ investment, a bad hire etc.
5. Set quantifiable personal goals with time targets, and measure how fast you're reaching those goals (i.e. velocity). I do this on a spreadsheet. Velocity tracking is more important than the goals themselves, because feedback is a more powerful force than motivation. One of the arbitrary goals I had was to attain a $10M credit limit by age 27. The goal didn't matter; it ended up taking me a couple more years. But the velocity tracking compelled me to take the actions that led up to it (founder secondary, finding a good PWM, getting a liquidity access line with low SOFR spread).
(C) Finding your significant other
Since you'll likely spend most of your time with your significant other, advice 4 isn't complete without a few pointers.
5. Unfortunately, you'll find that the most eligible pool of people will also tend to be attached and rarely available. This worsens with your target age, so unless you plan on dating someone much younger as you get older, you have a short window of time.
6. The best dating tip I can give is that people like to be a part of your life, and not for you to be a part of their life. So it's important to enrich yourself with experiences and conversational skills. An average-looking person with a healthy physique and a life that others are interested in has better odds of finding a better partner than someone blessed with good looks but a boring life.
7. A discouraging fact is that the person with good looks will still likely land a higher frequency of dates. But the great thing is that finding the best partner is a different optimization from getting the maximum number of dates - would you rather have 50 low quality dates or go on 1 date with and marry the one that makes everyone envious?
8. Find someone who will introduce the most variance to your life, with any positive expectancy.
There's two parts to this. ""Positive expectancy"" - material wealth, quality of intimacy, status, attention, contribution of labor etc. - is the trivial piece, but surprisingly where most life advice is sought. Only you can really tell if someone will have a positive expectancy on your life. I can think of one analogy: My wife went to a college where you must pass a swim test before you can graduate. The test requires that you be able to swim half the distance of the river in front of the campus. Why half? Because if you fall off the bridge and don't know which direction to swim, then no one's going to be able to save you.
""Variance"" is the more important part that people unfortunately tend to overlook. People worry too much if they're with someone who brings them large positive expectancy. It's OK to be with someone who has a small positive expectancy on your life, if that person brings huge variance to your life's outcomes and choices. This might mean someone with whom you'll be able to make tough choices, like sticking through grad school, a work relocation, a big career change, investment risks etc. This might also mean someone who is spontaneous and will encourage you to try new things you otherwise wouldn't. Past a small expectancy threshold, variance has a stronger correlation with happiness.
There's a scene from Interstellar, where the lead actress opined that the planet they were about to explore was too far from the black hole, and consequently wouldn't have the randomness to create the conditions for life. It's easier to find someone who will bring high variance to your life if you make high variance explorations. This means trying things outside your comfort zone, learning a new skill, say a language, or dating someone outside your school or culture. For me, I met my wife online before college, and that brought me to the other end of the world, which set me on this course.
(D) Well-being
9. The pursuit of wealth is a good cause if you make it one. Society will sell you that wealth is ugly. Or that happiness doesn't scale with wealth. I wanted to get a physics PhD and change the world. But I don't regret becoming wealthy. I can say that I'm an order of magnitude happier than when I was only making $200k per year. And it has given me the chance to help many more people.
10. Be happy for others. Several of my classmates got the Rhodes Scholarship. One of them coauthored one of the landmark CRISPR papers with Charpentier and Doudna. Someone applied to my company, got rejected, and later became a paper billionaire. Softbank was one of my investors, and many of my friends through them had 9+ figure exits. One of them was double timing his wife with models and employees, and eventually became mired in scandals that cost his job. Another friend - smarter and more competitive than me - made his first million before me, but took his own life last year.
People around you will become wildly successful, and being able to be happy for them will help you cope with your weaknesses, and make the right moral choices.

57717,101452,"I am a 19F local dating a China guy with a really curious trait. Whenever he has trouble remembering how to pronounce cheem-sounding English words, he will transliterate it into Chinese and memorize that instead. For instance, ""s**ual intercourse"" becomes ""Ë∞ÅËæìÂÑø Èò¥ÁâπÊâ£Ê≠ª‚Äú (shei-shu-er yin-te-kou-si), which I find so funny I make him say it every time he wants to do it.
But yesterday when I was helping him to spring-clean his room for CNY, I stumbled upon this army notebook of his. I recall that he told me as a second-gen PRC he had to serve, and he was a Platoon Sergeant, so I was curious and had a look at what he wrote. Lo and behold, it was full of Chinese transliterations of army commands and on one page, there was a full-blown Tang dynasty-esque poem:

58541,103048,"I have been an independent girl, I solve my own problems on my own.
Upon graduation, you won't believe how many people get into companies based on who they know, not what they know. Their relatives are connections which they depend on to secure employment. I am different. I did two internships, and every time holidays rolled around, I'd get myself a part time job. so through interviews and a few professional exams. I got my job offers. With absolutely no help from my family at all.
Then came convocation. I walked around empty handed when my friends carried teddy bears, balloons and flowers till their arms couldn't hold any more. Their parents, aunts and uncles each contributed to a convocation gift. Me? Nobody bought me anything. Unfazed, I decided not to whine or even hint to my family they ought to get me something. I marched up to the gift counter and bought my own convocation gifts with my own hard-earned money. I felt extremely proud of myself for being so self reliant. I don't rely upon my family like a crutch. I stand on my own two feet and get what I want with no assistance.
On my birthday, my clique didn't know. Cuz I sort of didn't publicise my birthday when I was in ntu. My parents knew and got me only a simple blouse. I don't think anyone else knew, or cared enough to throw me a surprise party or bombard me with gifts. Other people had Facebook walls flooded with birthday wishes, tables flooded with gifts, and phones flooded with birthday messages. I didn't feel upset. I can't be unloved unless I don't love myself, I can't receive no presents unless I don't give one to myself. I don't buy the idea that I need to extort gifts from my family. I don't burden them.
So I bought birthday presents for myself. I got myself an ice cream cake, earrings and heels. No one is here to stop me from getting things with my own hands.
It's not just in NTU that I learnt to be independent. it started in my earlier days, where everybody else got rewards for doing well in their a level exams except for me.
I hope everyone who reads this learn to find their own happiness by working on their own. The choice is yours.

59530,104917,"I'm currently dating a teacher for about 2 years, who is 3 years into the job (after PGDE). While we really love each other and are serious about one another, I'm a bit uncertain about our future together due to her workload and commitment to work.
Here is a sample of her average day:
Wake up at 540am
Leave house at 630am
Reach school by 710am
Teach classes till 130-2pm
CCA/ remedials/ meetings/ misc things till 530pm, leave school
Dabao, Reach home at 630pm
Eat dinner and chill to 8pm
Marking from 8 to 1130pm
Shower, etc, till 1230pm
Catch up on emails till 1am then sleep
So based on that, she works maybe 14-15 hours every weekday with just 4.5hrs of sleep and a good day every weekend just to catch up on work that couldn't be completed and lesson plans. Based on her salary, it's just ridiculous how much she has to work for that - Retail and F&B workers are better paid hourly than her.
I've been getting into fights with her and telling her that her lifestyle and is unsustainable as it'll lead to big burnouts and her health will suffer. On the flip end, she says that I'm not a teacher and I'd never understand her line of work.
Also, I realised that a lot of her teacher friends (female), are single well into late 30s and 40s - which I guess its due to their teaching lifestyle. On the flip end, most women I know from my line of work (private) are married by their late 30s.
I sincerely hope MOE can do something to lighten teacher's workloads. While that is wishful thinking, I'm wondering if I could get any advice on how to move forward...or move on.
Frankly I although I love her a lot, she had made it clear that her priority is to be a good teacher. So at the back of my mind, there is always this feeling that she loves teaching more than me.
Also, although we both agreed on having children, based on her workload, I don't see how we would be able to manage as I'm afraid she'll leave majority of the child rearing to me while she continues her passion. My job is way less tiring than hers and honestly I'm earning more than double of her - and in order for me to climb more, I need her to do her fair share of child rearing. I've mentioned to her that if we got married, I'd like for her to take a step back from her overloaded schedule and this was utterly shot down and more quarrels ensured.
So now I'm at a crossroads - should I push on and try to make things work, or try to move on to find someone who able to be more family oriented?

57856,101703,"I read here about marriage proposals that went wrong - guys not putting in enough effort etc. But marriage is so much more than just a proposal... there are so many other factors to consider.
I will tell you after 21 years of marriage... don't marry unless you are very sure.
We went to pre-marital workshops talk about anything under the sun. Talking is easy.
Doing chores, having kids, and even having s** is difficult.
Firstly, we had never even gone travelling alone before marriage, never stayed together at all before marriage.
It's ok if both parties are serious about making it work..however sadly people change. I feel like I ended up getting a shock. My hubby has never cooked nor has ever done a day of chores in his life.
We didn't even know how to have s**. We needed to read books about it.
We didn't even know that we both have fertility issues. We took three years to have our first child with clomid and 6 years to have our kids via ivf.
And when it came to kids - the person who usually ends up giving up their job to take care of them is the women. So the hubby who had promised to have a joint account at the start of the marriage suddenly decided to have an individual account.
Suddenly you realise all the promises of your money is my money and my money is your money is all nonsense... he changed. Knowing he is the sole breadwinner, he decides how much to give you and he keeps his own account from you.
He bought his ""own car"", changed his job to do anything he wants as he has his own money.
Suddenly, after 21 years of marriage, you realised you had sacrificed so much for the family (inhections, iui, ivf) but your husband acts like a single man.
He enjoys playing with the kids, but disciplining them and managing their studies, their handphone usage, their meals... all lies on your shoulders.
He continues to game and does not help with chores. He even continues watching p*rn as if he was single.
Then you realised - why did you even marry in the first place?
The diamond, the promises that he will continue to love and protect you and do all the chores are just nothing but lies.
He just enjoys the fact that he has a family so he won't be lonely. But other than that, he continues his single lifestyle.
So ladies, please open your eyes big big... don't look at the proposal, don't look at the diamond, the bank account, the house, the car, the degree.
Know if he is the guy you can spend the rest of your life with. As he is now, not what you hope he will be.
We are usually maternal and might give up everything for our family.
If given another chance... I would rather wait till I find a more suitable guy who truly loves me and keeps the marriage vows, than someone who will only keep the vows if you don't disturb his gaming or interfere with his money.

57685,101379,"I am an insurance agent. So many negative and hilarious posts about my job. Thought I'll offer another perspective to some people who are considering joining.
My credentials: I am under 30, in this line for years, quarter-million annual taxable income, MDRT and all the other awards, blah blah blah....
1. Do not underestimate the privilege of having no liabilities & responsibilities.
I joined this line at 21, and only needed to take care of myself financially. This means I could afford to earn only $12k a year back then while building my career slowly and organically. Treating every day working as a learning opportunity rather than being super despo to close the sale. Those desperate to close the sale usually fail because consumers are not idiots. Then it becomes a vicious cycle, no sale = no money = more despo. Trust me, you will earn like shit the first few years. That's normal. Those ""successful"", ""young"" agents that earn money ""fast"" are liars. There are so many dirty tricks in this industry to con the consumers. If you know you know.
2. Literally get good at money.
So many agents only call themselves ""investment specialists"" but can only sell their companies' ILP. That's bullshit. I know so many junior agents that do not even have a brokerage account and whatever issues the client has, ILP will always be the answer. While you are earning like shit, you should invest your own money and be legit good. Attend courses like CFA, CFP, ChFC, Certified Private Banking etc and APPLY the knowledge learnt. Do your own investments, talk to doctors to be aware of medical trends, be extremely familiar with all the different hospitals processes. Personally, I have certain qualifications and run my own investment holdings company, hence clients trust my advice more than some XMM in a LV bag talking about why her ILP is the best.
3. Network like f***.
Consumers can buy insurance online and this trend will increase in the future. So what is the agent's value proposition? I am the problem solver. Need some free legal advice? I can set up an informal dinner with my lawyer clients. Need a medical appt soon, I can bypass the long waiting time and set one for you within 3 days. Need to divorce your spouse? I know many private investigators and dirty tricks to increase your chances of winning. Need car mechanics and workshops? I get kickbacks from the shops and pass it to you as a form of savings. Need renovators and interior designers? I know people. Wanna get a job in IB (JP, UBS, Morgan Stanley etc), I know people, lemme set up a lunch. This network is exclusive to paying customers only, not even my extended family or friends have access to it, unless they are paying customers. The more the customers pay, the more priority you get in my network. So, it becomes a bidding war among customers and it makes good business sense.
That's all. You can earn a lot in this career, but it is all blood sweat and tears. Young naive people also quite dumb ah, you think can just suka suka earn $100K fresh out of school, with no qualifications meh? There is always a price to pay, hope this enlightens people out there.
Maybe I shall do a confession exposing how agents appear successful? and churning practices? hahahahaha

59108,104157,"When I took on my first job, I met a difficult colleague. She talks over me, never acknowledge my name, was mean to me when she gets a chance. I was new to the job so when I had questions she would call me stupid and be mean and not tell me the answer. I stayed for another 2 years before leaving because as much as I try to ignore her attitude towards me and try to improve, I find as long as she's around she will not stop treating me like a stupid newbie. She was seniority conscious and I was the last staff the company hired even after 2 years so she kept treating me like a noob. As more staff left, she was throwing more work at me even though we hold the same position. I couldn't take it and left too.
Fast forward 8 years later. I went to a new company and did fairly well. We survived covid and I also survived retrenchment and got promoted after (even though the pay increase wasn't much, I am happy where I am)
We had a recruitment exercise recently with me being part of the team in charge and guess who came to interview? She looked shocked the moment she entered the interview room and saw me sitting in the center out of 3 interviewers. She greeted me by my name and called me Miss. Wow. To think last time she called me 'oei' for 2 years even though I had been wearing a name tag.
I didn't show any sign of recognizing her and started the interview. She did her best to try to impress us. When it was over I guess she knew she's not going to get the job. She messaged me after and tried to be friends and talked as though we have catching up to do. I just said it was nice to see her and left the rest unanswered.
She wasn't a good fit for the job and we didn't call her back for another round of interview. I wonder if she had any regret of being mean to me in the past.
Karma vibes is strong here. One thing I learnt from her: Don't be mean to anyone. You never know if you need this person's kindness and grace in the future. I don't care if she changed or not and I'm not interested to find out.

58125,102269,"Subject: 50-50 Split in Relationship
I have been hearing about the so called general norms of setting up a joint acc and contribute to the said account for the expenses etc based on your income. Each couple has different arrangements. Let me share mine..
My husband has been working in financial industry with senior positions, hence he brings more income for our household. Since our dating time,I have asked him what his preference is. Setting up a joint account and contributing x percentage according to our income? He proceeded to tell me that he will take care of all the bills and expenses. Let me keep my portion of salary (at this point of time, we never went for BTO as he already purchased his own property).
And yeah we proceeded to do that. He paid all the household bills,groceries,car n house installments, even my online shopping bills, meal with my friends, all those big expenses like hospital bills and insurance plans. He said that since he earns way more,let him take care of me as it is his duty as a guy and as a head of family. He said he is looking for a wife and future mother of his kids, not a business partner, so why need to calculate so much? He asked me to keep my salary and encouraged me to keep working in order to have a sense of financial freedom, building my self confidence and to enhance my personal growth as well as networking. As a husband, he's going to be my pillar of support and I can always rely on him emotionally and financially. He is also giving me a small amount of monthly allowance as a token of appreciation.
Now that we have a baby, I have quit my job since I cannot bear to be away from my baby, but I feel guilty for not working. Nevertheless, he told me that it does not matter, he will support my family's monthly allowance (I'm still giving monthly allowance to my fam btw) on top of providing me with extra allowance. Of course our savings will shrink, but he said why so calculative?His money is my money too. I have contributed a lot by being a mother to our baby, and he feels sorry for not being able to spend more time to take care of our baby due to his busy work schedule. He said I have worked hard and contribute so much in giving birth and sacrificing my careet in order to raise our baby, so he is doing the minimum he can do as a husband.
I know every couple has their own arrangement..nothing is wrong or right, it really depends on their own circumstances and level of comfort. I really appreciate my husband as I know he is rare in the market (even all my friends told me so). What works for me may not work for others and vice versa. In return, what I provided to my husband is respect and prudence. I let him have his financial freedom and discourage him from making big purchases like buying branded goods for me or fancy car or posh private property. I'd rather he channel his cash for investment and saving plans. I'd rather not burden our finance by insisting to purchase fancy house or car for ""face"", but to do it when we can very comfortably afford the loan installments.
That being said, every couple has different definition of being ""calculative"". I'm sharing mine as I would like to say that, husband will not lose anything by contributing more if they can afford to. Afterall,a wife will turn your house to home, carry your baby for 9 months, breastfeed and nurture your family, all while working as well. Can these being split 50-50 also? Down the road, there are roles which will continue to grow between husband and wife. I want my daughter to have a financial independence to build a family, but I also wish for her husband to treat her like what her daddy treats me. As such, I would also like my son to treat his future wife like how his father is treating his mother.
Selflessness will trigger sincerity and gratitude. A little goes a long way :)
P.s. for singles, do not give up on looking for a partner that wholeheartedly loves and respects you. I found mine on dating apps :) hehe, thank you for reading. Have a good day!

59805,105494,"I just wanna remind everyone that while you chase greater and greater things in your life, don't forget to ask yourself all the time ""am I happy?""
A lot of times we chase things without really trying to understand whether it is what we truly want to do. We may end up very successful but empty inside. Or we may not end up successful at all, and feel depressed that we didn't become the person we think we deserve to be. I write this more to remind the highest achievers, that just because you do very well in school doesn't mean that you should feel the need to make as much money as possible. It also doesn't necessarily mean you have what it takes to make a lot of money. A lot of very highly qualified people in Singapore are working middle-class jobs because of absolutely idiosyncratic reasons. It could also be because they suck in the real world. I have met very educated people who were perfectly happy pursuing a simple job with less pay than they could have gotten, because either the job is something they love doing and therefore better at, or their job allowed them to do other things that may not pay at all but are nevertheless valuable.
Two months ago, my friend's friend's son ended his life. He was a remarkable student. He went to Hwa Chong, Imperial, and then MIT. Brilliant brilliant kid. Absolutely brilliant in math. After he graduated he started working at a very very famous investment bank. He ended his life on the 5th year. I then found out from his parents that he always talked about becoming a teacher/lecturer growing up, but chose to go into banking for the money.
Not everyone who did very well in school find joy pursuing careers that pay a lot of money. Not everyone who did very well in school have the competence and characteristics to do equally well at any job. Even if the stars align, doing well in school doesn't even remotely measure your management skills. Which means even if you have the most prestigious degrees, you may find yourself stuck in middle-management because you just do very low-value stuff very well, or you do high-level technical stuff very well but nobody is paying you for that talent. Also, not everyone who did very poorly in school wouldn't one day find something to do that would pay them a lot more than a Harvard student. As an exercise, I'm sure you know of Singaporeans who are immensely wealthy who didn't have much schooling. Sheng Siong, BreadTalk, Hotel 81, HaiDiLao etc. These are all very idiosyncratic as I said.
So by all means do well in school, but also know that to make a lot of money requires a special sauce that your professors wouldn't know of. Very few people would know what it takes. And also, quit obsessing over making tons and tons of money and obsess over doing something you absolutely love. You will never do very well in the things you don't enjoy doing anyway. So pursuing a career because it pays more, not because you are interested and passionate about it, may not even be the most optimal decision. i.e You may actually end up making a lot less.

I'm fat ok. I have a pot belly and I'm not even 30. I try to exercise but I work really long hours, sometimes I just want to go straight to sleep when I get home. I eat whatever is served to me at work so I cannot afford to be choosy as I don't want to pack cold lunch boxes. I eat whatever my mother cooks because I am not a picky eater. I wear glasses and didn't get contact lenses or want to do lasik. I hang out with a lot of older people due to my job. So I really have not much chance to meet girls. Sometimes they joke about helping to matchmake me with their daughter or niece. I never took their offer seriously.
I know this girl from another friend. I find her very pretty. She works in the beauty industry so she is always well groomed. We spent a lot of time messaging before meeting in person. I grew to like her but I was worried because I can tell she is barely half my size. I didn't want her to meet me out of pity so I didn't ask her out a second time. We continued to message each other often. I really enjoyed talking to her. The next time we met with another friend in tow. She asked me why didn't I ask her out and she wanted me to accompany her to this place after we split with our friend. I guess I didn't get the hint as I thought she only thought of me as a friend. She held my hand and told me she like me.
Now I'm happily attached for the last 6 months to this gorgeous girl. I'm sure she didn't fall in love with my pot belly first. I met her parents and they accepted me. She's not a princess, she is very understanding and kind hearted. My parents approve of her too.
I don't earn a lot, I'm not good looking, I'm not a smooth talker. But I'm genuine to her. So don't give up guys. There is always someone out there for someone like you.

I think I speak for most women when I say it‚Äôs a huge turn off when a man behaves like he‚Äôs entitled to my body. Like hello, I already grant you access to my body on a regular basis, and I have the right to say no to you occasionally when I‚Äôm not in the mood or not well. My body is not a all-you-can-eat buffet.
So now, I totally have lost all my s** drive. I am dead & numb from the waist down. Whenever he wants s**, I just give in because it‚Äôs easier than dealing with his f***ing toddler tantrums. I just lie there like a dead fish and wait for it to be over. To be honest sometimes I even feel like I‚Äôm being used; and I feel so damn resentful towards him.
I can‚Äôt wait to dump him and never have s** with a man again. He totally ruined my drive with his behavior. Absolutely appalling and disgusting. He‚Äôs made something that was supposed to be enjoyable into something that feels like a chore.
So guys. If your other half doesn‚Äôt seem to be in the mood, PLEASE don‚Äôt force it. The worst thing you can do is react badly to her saying no, by reacting aggressively or even passive aggressively. Don‚Äôt even try to be subtle with a sour attitude. We can sense it.
All we want to hear is, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay baby.. we don‚Äôt need to have s** today if you‚Äôre not feeling up to it. Let‚Äôs just chill okay?‚Äù It‚Äôs that simple.
S** is so much more enjoyable when the other party is not SO hung up about whether he‚Äôs getting laid; and he just wants to spend time with me. If a man were to just offer me a back rub or foot rub after a long day without expecting anything in return, I think there‚Äôs a high chance I‚Äôll actually want to jump him.
A man who can fully respect boundaries and our bodily autonomy is rare; and that quality makes a man so attractive tbh.
A man who can be affectionate, and touch me in non-s**ual way, is so much hotter than a desperate man who‚Äôs like constantly trying to burrow his way into my pants every single time he‚Äôs near me. Ew.

To the op with a gambling boyfriend of 2.5 years.
I used to have a boyfriend who gambles. I left him after 2 years as I could no longer see a future with him. And the reason was not just about the gambling but also a collective pattern in his behavior that made me decided to leave him.
He is with friends with people who gamble. His family members also gamble. They moved houses a few times because of loan sharks. He told me he hated his dad for gambling and making his mum suffer and being forced to work 2,3 jobs to keep the house running. They gamble in hundreds and thousands per session depending on the game. He has a bad temper but has never flared up at me in those 2 years of being together but I have seen him get angry at his friends and family and it was an ugly side of him. I wouldn't dare to make him angry. He uses and abuse his weaker friends and sucks up to friends who are more powerful and richer than him. I hated the way he treated service staff. He uses index and middle finger to pass card or cash. Soon I realised his entire family member does that so it's a learnt behavior.
I spent hours and hours watching him play. Some days he lose some days he win. He plays with people he hate and also with people he like. Sometimes someone will accuse him of owing them $500 or $1000 when he don't even remember and he would just pay even when his bank account is left with $50. When he wins he splurge and treats everyone for a meal or drinks. He gambles not only the weekends but also during weekdays after work. Sometimes I pay for meals, dates and transport when he is broke. He has never tried to borrow money from me and I've never offered.
One day I just had a revelation. I want out and I started to spend less and less time with him. I got no balls to tell him to his face that I do not want to become his mother and suffer. The week when we broke up he took a while to realise why I left without me saying the truth. He told me he quit gambling but I never believed him.
This happened in my early 20s. 2.5 years is enough of a time for you to decide if your bf is worth sticking around for. From the way you talked about him, I think you know the answer already. Gambling aside, you would not want a gaslighting husband. Good times everyone can be nice. Don't be blinded. Look at everything as a whole. What matters more is during the hard and bad times, what does he choose to do?
Your future children can't choose who their father is but you can. Choose wisely.

59912,105729,"I started work in a big MNC last year. On my first day, I met someone from a different department and developed a crush on him instantly. My heart skipped a beat and fluttered at the sight of him. I even took a photo of him, secretly.
Somehow, we bumped into each other in the lobby and lift a lot and eventually started talking to each other. This went on for a while and for some reason I did not notice his wedding ring until much later when he brought up his wife. Needless to say, when I found out, I was devastated. I could feel my heart sink. I remember thinking ""this is not possible!"". Nonetheless, and even though it was very difficult, I knew better and I resolved that I would keep my distance.
And so, we did not talk much... until 2 months later.
It started with him sharing with me funny TikTok videos. He then asked me out for lunch almost every other day. Soon we started to text each other frequently. We talked about everything under the sun - the news, happenings in the company, colleagues, our personal lives, etc. We couldn't stop talking to each other. After some time, he started to shower me with compliments on my looks. Out of courtesy, I reciprocated. He also offered to help me with my work. When it rained in the evenings, he offered to fetch me home. It felt good to have that kind of support at work and someone to lift my spirits, especially as I was new.
Developing a friendship with him felt dangerous because of my feelings for him. But since he was honest about his marital status and did not express any interest in me, I convinced myself that as long I kept my feelings to myself, nothing could go wrong.
Later, he started to share with me how unhappy he felt in his marriage. In gist, he said they got married to apply for a BTO but after being unsuccessful a few times, their marriage took a turn for the worse. He said that he did love her but she became a ""different"" person after marriage. She became emotional, impatient, and withdrawn. She stopped working, put on weight, and stopped taking care of her appearance. They haven't been intimate as regularly. She was physically violent towards him. As a result, she became insecure and controlling. He said he felt cheated and trapped.
I advised him to work on his marriage, as marriage is a commitment for life. Inevitably, everyone will go through ups and downs, and being committed means lifting your partner up and not finding ways to ditch them when they are down. I told him to go for couple therapy if needed.
Somehow, after that conversation, he started to pursue me very seriously and intensely. He confessed his feelings for me and told me that he fell in love with me at first sight and wished he wasn't married the day he saw me. I was very surprised to learn that the feelings were mutual but I bit my tongue and kept quiet.
This went on for quite some time and on one occasion, against my better judgment, we kissed in his car. The kiss felt exhilarating and intoxicating, like the meeting of two hungry souls. Yet at the same time, I felt disappointed in myself. Ashamed, that I let it happen. I felt guilty towards his wife. I felt disgusted at myself.
After that incident, I knew I needed to talk to someone. I spoke to my closest girl friends. I spoke to my closest guy friends. The conversations were hard and they were not necessarily things I was prepared to hear... But it did help me arrive at the right decision.
In the end, I told him these and cut all contact with him except on work and only if it is absolutely required:
""If you really love me, like you say you do, you will think on my behalf and do what is good for me. It is not in my best interest to be involved with a married man. I am very sorry about your marriage, but the problems are for you to face with your wife hand-in-hand. You are a good person and I am grateful for the friendship. However, for now, it is best we refrain from contact. For my well-being, I will set up a block but I can be reached via e-mail on work-related matters if needed. I hope you can understand and respect my decision. Take care!""
Thankfully for me, he did not cause a scene at work. I have also taken active steps to avoid him like working from home more. I remember bawling when I typed and sent the message above, and wondering if I did the right thing even weeks later. After all, I have never felt this way with anyone else.
Now a few months have gone and flown by. Hindsight, I am so glad I made the decision to talk to my friends about what I was going through and cut contact. My decisions gained me my self-esteem, dignity, and self-respect. And above-all, self-love.
Per Ru Paul: ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else? Can I get an amen?""

60172,106218,"My advice to all young gentlemen out there
Don‚Äôt get married. Yep. I said it. DO NOT GET MARRIED. It‚Äôs a scam that‚Äôs so normalized that nobody even realizes it‚Äôs a scam.
I mean it. And I am not some bitter old man. On the surface I appear to be a moderately successful professional married to another (seemingly) successful white collar professional, and let me tell u‚Ä¶ I am miserable af.
Marriage is basically like doing half the household chores like a housemate (nowadays the girls all want to split household chores), and yet you‚Äôll be paying for everything, fetching her around like a taxi driver, carrying her shopping bags, and whole be busy helping somebody‚Äôs dustyass daughter run errands.
God only knows why I signed up for this shit show. My life would probably have been a lot better if I didn‚Äôt get married and remained single.
Don‚Äôt just take my word for it. ALL of my married gentlemen friends regret getting married and none of them would want to get married again if they could turn back the clock.
Some of them are now divorced, and still having to co-parent with a shitty ass girl who‚Äôs out to make their lives miserable & on top of that are horrible shitty mothers.
Most girls nowadays aren‚Äôt looking for a husband. They just want a new daddy who can pamper them like princesses. Bonus if the new daddy is good looking and/ or has a nice body they can get whacked by at night. That‚Äôs all they‚Äôre after.
I‚Äôve no doubt that the comments will be filled with these pathetic woman-children whining about how women bring nothing to the table.
We are the whole dining room set from IKEA, b*tch. We make our own money, we buy our own shit, we can cook our own meals and we can make ourselves cum better than u ever can.
What do *YOU* bring to the table, besides a bland AF personality (hehe bubble tea is my personality, I love K-pop uwu), zero dress sense (let me guess- your whole wardrobe is from Taobao & Charles and Keith), average pay check ($3-5k LOL) and average boobs (A/B LOL)?
So pls for the love of God, gentlemen don‚Äôt get married. Listen to me. Don‚Äôt make the same shitty mistake I and along with so many other ladies made. You‚Äôll thank me in the future when you watch all your other friends get married and then divorced.
And the G wonders why the marriage and birth rate are dropping year after year. Look at the quality of the guys. Totally CMI.
The gentlemen have been stepping up and most of us are doing household chores and cooking great food, contributing to the household; as compared to our parents generation.
But women? Can‚Äôt even fry an egg to save her own life, and have to rely on grab to order every dinner. Yet every expense don't wanna pay. Hard pass.
If you‚Äôre already engaged it‚Äôs not too late. Call it off. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôll lose money. Better to lose money than your time. It‚Äôs also much worse and much more expensive to get a divorce.
If you‚Äôre dating, just date her for fun. Date her yo satisfy your own needs and for companionship, but focus on your own career and yourself. Don‚Äôt need to get too serious. Treat her as a fun hobby. Nothing more. No need to legally bind yourself to one person. Women's charter isn't funny.
And if she‚Äôs not treating u like an absolute king while you‚Äôre dating, PLS don‚Äôt waste your time. She‚Äôs not going to step her game up after marriage. If she‚Äôs not at least a 9.5/10 during courtship, don‚Äôt bother. It‚Äôs only downhill from there. If she‚Äôs only a 5-6 now, he will be a 1-2 after marriage. Confirm plus chop. Don‚Äôt say nobody tried to warn u.

59833,105558,"I had a crush on my Korean friend. This was almost a decade ago before the K-pop wave but already back then, he took my heart. He was based in Singapore and we met often. He would bring me to the best Korean restaurants and I, in turn, would introduce him to nice local food. We talked about everything under the sky but we never once crossed the line. Once, we happened to be both overseas at the same country (for work) at the same time. We arranged to meet to hike up a mountain. It was romantic and I wanted to express my feelings for him. But I didn't. Soon after, he left Singapore and returned to Korea. I couldn't stop thinking where we would be if only I said something. We tried to keep in touch but soon, our daily messages become weekly, and that became monthly. Life progresses for both of us and a few years later, we each found our own partners, settled down and had kids of our own.
Years later, he returned for a holiday and asked to meet up. I invited him to my home, introduced him to my husband and children. He brought along his kids too. We had dinner at a restaurant and when my husband was bringing all the kids out to play at the play area outside, he looked at me and said, ""You know, I am so happy for you. You are doing so well. Your husband is such a great man. I am a simple guy. I cannot give you what you need. I will not be able to make you happy if you were with me. I am so happy for you now.""
In that moment, I understood. The feeling was mutual but unexpressed. I love my family and will never change them for anything. But I am counting my blessing for having experience a ""relationship"" like this.

58088,102201,"Just a rant from the spouse of a junior doctor.
My husband goes to work daily before 5am and only ends work after 7.30pm. Sometimes, he does 30h to 32h calls which is from 5.30am till 1pm the next day. He works more than 100h a week when the contract says not more than 80h. He works both weekends and once worked 20 days consecutively. It is common to work for 14 days in a row and I have heard some horror stories of his friends working 30 days straight without a day off. He doesn't reflect his true working hours in the system as if you get caught for working more than 100h, they won't investigate why you overworked, they will investigate why YOU overworked. Thus, to avoid all the troubles, it is a common practise to under report the actual working hours.
My husband doesn't bring home much. His starting pay is $4k before CPF deduction and with all the on-calls and weekend half-days, that brings maximum another extra $1k - $1.5k. Is $5k justifiable for >400h of work per month? I don't think so.
They have no time and energy for their loved ones. He comes home late and usually will continue reading up until he falls asleep at his desk. We hardly date because he has to work and albeit saying that he is not tired and he can go on a date with me, I know he is and I'll prefer to let him sleep in. We have been delaying our wedding because he is too busy and we are still saving up.
Will MOH wake up their idea? No, that's why healthcare workers get claps and not a better working system.
Thank you for listening to my rant.

58663,103277,"I came from a humble family. Went to neighbourhood school. Barely made it to NTU. I studied hard and got a prestigious scholarship to for PhD studies in NUS. At this point, I had a little fame. Many people know me for my intelligence. Many people said I would be genius one day and be very successful.
Then when I graduated, by chance, I befriended upper class people and learned a lot about being wealthy. It seems my path in life was set, until the Netflix documentary, Surviving Death, appeared. Using that as a stepping stone, I researched deeply into the spiritual world, and found out that we are spiritual beings here to on Earth to learn unconditional love. Nothing else matters. Neither status nor material wealth. That our souls was involved in the planning of our lives before we are born. Who we meet, the parents we will have, the careers we will have. Many things were planned. All we have to do is to trust a higher power and do good and be good.
Now my focus in life has changed, from achieving social status and wealth, to serving people and bringing joy to others. I enjoy donating money randomly to the needy. I also take a lot of effort to reduce the amount of waste other people generate.

The search for my biological father didn't take long because the company he works for still exists. Turns out one of his children works there now. This person was willing to meet me.
My biological father actually passed away not long ago. They all knew about my existence but out of respect for their mother, they stopped short of locating me. He said his father actually had a few pictures of me throughout the years. I am aware my mother didn't send him any photos of me so I assume he had checked me out on his own.
He said he was expecting to hear from me, he just didn't know when. He insisted he did not hate me because I did not ask to be born. We even tried to compare our appearance by taking a few photos together. He made me feel comfortable during our awkward meet up. He has this friendly and warm aura which I think should be the same like my biological father. He did not say much about his family's reaction about me so I guess not everyone knew or wanted to hear from me. He asked me questions about myself. He asked if I lived well as a child then he said I must have done great because I'm a sensible adult now. He said if I needed to look for a job he can help. He also asked about my mother and wished her well.
I had prepared a list of questions of things I wanted to know and he answered almost all of them, including giving me some information about their family medical history. Those that were unanswered he promised to find out. He also handed me a few photos of my biological father. When we said our good byes he insisted we keep in touch. I wasn't hopeful because I don't want to assume he had accepted me as his half sibling. We added each other on fb.
When I got home, we all hugged and I cried. I feel this huge weight and tension lifted off my body but I also feel bad for causing my family distress. Especially my mother. I promised my stepdad he is my dad no matter what happens and I asked him to forgive me for insisting on my search. They are relieved it turned out ok. I'm not sure if I will continue to keep in touch with my half sibling. For now, I feel this odd sense of content to have some answers as well as loss for a man that I've never met. I will never know if he had ever wanted to meet me or not. I hope in time, I will be able to let go of this thought.

58536,103052,"Marriage is just a piece of paper or is it not?
I met this guy. He was perfect. He checked all the boxes of being an eligible bachelor. It was love at first sight for the both of us. We met each other at a friend's party and got together soon after.
A few months into the relationship we started to talk about us. He felt he is not marriage or kids material but he loves me a lot and can see a future with me. He was very clear about this and wanted me to understand before we continue. At that time he also suggested that we get a place together. Eventually he ended up getting a place on his own and I moved in with him. He told me I need not pay anything but I contributed by paying some of the bills and minor house expenses. I felt I was very much in love with him that a part of me believe I can forsake marriage as long as we are happy together. Besides I dislike children myself.
We are not married but we lived like a married couple. We cook for each other, did chores, managed the bills, visited each other's parents and we did everything together. I thought we had the perfect life. We lived like we are married and yet we have the time to date each other. I was envied by friends who witnessed our love. He still buys me flowers and gifts on special days like anniversaries, after being together for 10 years.
The final few months of our relationship I sensed his increasing distance. I convinced myself we are just busy with work and other things. He was out more, he stopped telling me about his day. It got to a point I felt we were like roommates living under the same roof. Then he told me he met someone. He needed me to move out because the other woman wants to move in.
I haven't had time to compose myself and react to this utter betrayal and I had to pack up. 10 years meant nothing to him?.. I moved back to my parents and lied to them that his place is under construction.
I haven't even had time to process my anger and grief then I heard he had a vehicle accident. His parents wasn't aware that we broke up so I was called first. I found out he was severely injured that his life won't be the same forever. The other woman didn't hesitate to dump him after seeing his condition.
Since his parents didn't know we had broken up, I choose to pretend I'm still his gf and stayed with him at the hospital. I took over most of the caregivers job because he was so helpless. I stayed over at his place often and took care of him for a while. He couldn't carry on with his current job anymore so he had to settle for a simpler job which pays lesser. The lucky thing is he had almost paid off the house so he didn't need to downgrade.
He had been needy towards me since the accident. I can understand that. How can I not feel for him? We did have a lot of happy times till this happened. I continued being there for him as he needed a lot of help and support. One day he asked me if I wanted to get married. I realised this was what I wanted all along. But not like this. I said no and realised it is time to leave him. I didn't want to take care of him anymore. So I left.
Now, I'm already past the age of having kids safely. I did try to move on. I tried to date but without much success. I met 2 who were quite persistent in chasing me. But none interest me or can even compare to him. I've got my own place during the time I was taking care of him. I think a part of me already know I won't get back together with him. I just needed a push to move on with my own life. Did I regret not getting married when I was younger? Definitely. I may have lived a very different life if I walked away the moment he told me he is not marriage material. If he cheated while we are married maybe he wouldn't have got hurt because I may not have moved out so easily.
Without a marriage certificate, it's very easy to walk away when things happen. So what kind of a person did I wanted to be? One who walks away or one who stays because of a piece of paper?

58689,103318,"So I finally crossed paths with my ex at my workplace after 3 years. Since we parted ways I've always wondered how I would react to her reappearance again. All I did, quite pathetically, was tapped on her shoulder and uttered a measly ""hi"". Even as I walked away, my heart was pounding frantically, as if back to the first time we met after my fateful confession.
She was my first love and every shade the dream girlfriend as a teenager I yearned to have. We were also our class' model couple, and received heaps of marriage invitations as if everyone expected us to pull it off eventually. We were also inseparable throughout secondary school and JC; she was there through the lowest points in my life, and so was I for hers. But as it turned out, we grew apart and ultimately went our separate ways.
As far as I know, she's relishing a life of familial bliss now, married and happily raising a son - a future we had once envisioned as a couple. To be honest, I'm just a tad little envious, but mostly happy that she realised her dream. As of me, it has been a rough journey since 3 years ago. The gaping hole that she left behind remains to be filled. There is this girl I met in CCA that caught my attention, but for reasons unbeknownst even to myself I haven't been able to summon enough courage to even strike up a conversation with her, much less start a new relationship. Once bitten, twice shy, perhaps?
To all budding, first-time couples out there: don't be afraid to devote your all in a relationship. Even if it doesn't work out in the end, you would have written a exhilarating chapter in your life - that of first love. There will be countless regrets, and I dare say, they are even inevitable. But the one thing not matched by subsequent relationships is the naive, innocent and pure romanticisation of love; a signpost you will look back later for guidance as you try to navigate romance in the harsh, real world.
To P, I'm thankful for everything. Really.

58159,102358,"Reading so many posts about relationships and having my own share of experiences before finally finding someone to settle down. Been through 4 medium to long term (> 2 years) relationships. I'm married close to 20 years now.
I want to say this to those who are still seeking love.
If you have problems/issues that cannot be resolved or compromised while you are still bf/gf, the same problems will only get worse after marriage. When you are looking for certain qualities in a person, did you self reflect and see if you have anything to offer? Do you want to grow to become a better version of yourself? Do you have the potential to bring out the best in your partner? Do you want the best for your partner?
I recently had a reunion meet up with old friends and found out through them that 2 of my exes are still single after 20 years. The 3rd one divorced after being married for less than 5 years. I married my 4th bf.
All 3 relationships I left because I cannot imagine a future with the guy and there were issues that cannot be resolved. They did not possess qualities of being a reliable partner then. I don't know why they are still single now but I'm glad I moved on else I wouldn't have met my husband.
When I met my husband, he made me want to become a better version of me. It was not hard to love him at all. Like any couples, we have conflicts and disagreements but there was 1 distinct difference about him, he is a listener, he is patient and he can compromise when my request is reasonable. Because of that I start to behave more like him. I start to be more patient too. When I almost slipped back into my old princess ways he will lovingly talk to me and make me want to be a better person not just for him but also for myself. With a blink of an eye, we have spent 20 blissful years together. He became an even better man, better than I imagined, after we have children.
A relationship should not be turning your life upside down and making you question your worth in life.
A relationship should be a fulfilling one that makes you the best version of yourself. If you and your partner do not have this same goal in mind, being together will be hard. To those still looking for love, I hope you find that someone. If you want to meet a patient man, be a patient woman. If you want to meet a kind woman, be kind first.
If you date around with a certain kind of mentality, you are likely going to attract that and your thoughts will lead you to justify that negativity. Consider a setback a lesson that will make you a better person for the partner you have yet to met.
Good luck!

60197,106279,"To the people having bad days out there, it will end one day! I was a poly student, now gotten a place in uni(This post will mainly be talking about my difficult times in poly). However, it wasnt an easy journey. In fact, it's been a tough 3 years of my life in poly. I had to juggle between work and studies.
As I came from a less privileged family, I didnt want to add any more financial burden to my parents such as asking for living fee. Hence, I had to work almost everyday during my school holiday just to earn myself some living fee. (believe me, student part time jobs will make you feel like the lowest form of living on earth). Both of my parents does not have a degree, not even a government diploma, so i know how difficult life can be without having a good education in singapore. All I have in my mind is to make it into a local uni(NUS/NTU) to pursue my passion and make my parents proud. Due to these, I had to sacrifice most of my social life on work and studies. (life with just mugging and working can be demoralising sometimes).
Just when i thought my poly life is smooth sailing with everything well planned, tragedy happened. At poly year 2, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. This means that the breadwinner of the family is down, my family might not have a stable income for a long period of time... Due to this, my mom was extra stressed and had to work 2 jobs per day sometimes. Thankfully, he got the tumor removed and everything is fine. Just when i thought everything is over, my mom got diagnosed with cancer as well at poly year 3. I was having internship and fyp at the point of time. When i heard the news, i nearly broke down. I have no motivation to study, or even do anything. I thought of giving up in my studies and just go out and work for the family after NS.
I was stressed, feeling miserable and did not know what to do. I did not talk to friends about this as I did not know how to start this convo and i dont want them to pity me or look at me in a different way. I hide everything in my heart. I didnt cry as shit was already messy enough and i cannot show my family that i gonna break down. I took weeks to get myself together again, and continued to pushed on as this is the only thing that i can do.
Thankfully, my parents are getting better and recovering. I managed to graduate with a diploma with merit, and secure a spot in my dream uni. Even better, I managed to get a bonded scholarship to fund my uni and secure a job in advance. Life is a mix of sweet and bitter, and this is part of growing up. What I want to share with everyone is that no matter what you are going through now, dont give up. The rainy days will be over!

59267,104454,"Hi everyone, hope to hear some of ur views. Hope this gets posted.
Tldr - How do I avoid looking like a cheapskate in front of my colleagues?
Some background abt me. I'm a single mum of 1 school going boy, 2 elderly parents who are not working. In my 30s and I work in the CBD area doing client facing role earning mid 4figure salary. I'm ur typical sandwiched generation - not wealthy but also not starving.
My colleagues would usually go for salad lunches costing $15 per meal, eat together for dinner at those restaurants before going home, talk about the latest fashion (bags, shoes, clothes) during lunchtime. While they are nice enough to ask me to join them for meals, a part of me feels torn - I understand that lunch sessions are a great way to bond but as compared to the $3.50 cai png (and multiplying it 5 times a wk) I could have saved so much more which would all go towards better use such as for my son or my parents. Not forgetting my colleagues would buy a nice $4 coffee after lunch too. I do try and join them sometimes, but I'm also running out of excuses to basically say that I cannot afford to eat such ""fancy"" food that often because I'm the sole breadwinner. I try not to dress too shabbily as well since we all meet clients but I can't possibly be buying new branded clothes all the time just like my colleagues just to look nice, I thought being presentable is good enough. My colleagues would also chip in for monthly office treats (not mandatory but ppl do know if u don't contribute) and it just looks bad on me if I don't put in some cash, or sometimes my colleagues would just treat each other to a beverage, though again I know these all sum up to be quite the usual office expenditure, and I fear I look like the odd one out just because I don't exactly ""behave"" like my other colleagues.
I guess my spending habits are rather atypical of an office worker in the CBD, partly because I think every cent I save then goes towards my household - as my kid grows older and parents age definitely expenses at home will rise too. In a way, Idw to be buying $4 coffee treating my colleagues when that $4 can go towards my son's pocket money/a bowl of noodles for my parents? Is it wrong to tighten my belts and allocate scarce funds this way?
I know I don't earn alot and there're many mouths to feed at home. Despite my shiny office wear actually I'm just a median salaried worker. It's also not that Idw to find another job that pays more, but my current job on balance allows me the flexibility for my family needs and is paying me a livable wage after all. So I wonder am I being too cheapo and if yes, how do I overcome this image so that my colleagues do not see me as this weird miser?
