56677,98584,"To those who felt that you are at the stage if talking about settling down instead of breaking up with your boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't seem to be the right one, trust me, it's never too late. It's better to break it off now instead of marrying the wrong one.
I am a 过来人. I was 28 (F) when I broke off with my then bf of 3 years. We already talked about marriage, applied for BTO, planned for our future wedding dates, etc. Everyone thought that we will definitely get married one day. But others don't see what's really happening between us. He is a smart guy, with high paying job and constantly given praises by people around him. Basically he is like the Mr Perfect in everyone's eye. He was the one who chased me. When we first got together, we felt like we complement each other. Eventually, it started to become me chasing after his perfection. Like because he is this perfect, I need go be as perfect. And no, he didn't tell me it is ok to be who I am cause that's who he really loves, he expects me to be as perfect as him. He finds me watching drama, reading blogs all these as wasting my time away (PS: I only do it once I'm done with my work). He always talk on the phone about work and when I commented that I didnt get enough attention from him, he said at least he is doing something that earns money and not laze around. But I was in love. Afterall, he is the Mr Perfect and everyone tells me how I should not lose him. Then it started to take a toll on my mental health, crying to sleep everynight cause I felt like I was never good enough. I communicated the issues with him and he didn't feel like he has any wrong. Eventually, we decided to go on our separate ways, and gave up on our BTO.
The rs was so painful that it took me 2 years to decide that I need to start opening my heart again. Went on some dates (dating app) and went on a few dates with those I thought we have chemistry when talking via app but ZERO chemistry when we met irl.
At 33 years old, I met a guy via mutual friend. We hit off instantly. I really enjoyed talking to him. He is not perfect.. not well educated, earn less than me, slightly shorter than me, few years younger than me. To put it bluntly, people would say he ""pick until gold"" if I ever agree to be his gf. I shared with my friends that I was interested in him and none of my friends felt that we can work out cause he is too different from my previous Mr Perfect style. But I went ahead to agree to be his gf within one month after knowing him.
And fast forward, I am 37 year old now. He proposed to me after we were together for only 3 months cause he felt like I am the one for him, just as how I also told him I felt like he is the one for me. We got married 10 months after getting together. We are going to celebrate our 3 years wedding anniversary soon and our first son came out just last year.
Couples can be together for 10 years and still breakup while couples who are tgt for 10 days could meant for ever. Length of rs does not determine how successful the rs will be. It could be 10 years old quarrel or 10 months of working towards being one. So it is never too late to break up with the wrong one. I thought I was gonna be single for life but my soul mate appeared when I was no longer looking. It may be late but it's better than suffering all my life being with the wrong one.
Don't ever decide your life based on society norms. Do what you think is best for you and your mental health. Ask yourself what makes you happy and do all the happy things when you are single. Share those happy moments when you meet your future soul mate down the road and eventually share more happy moments when you find the one.
Jiayou!

56278,97257,"I am a 35/M and I went to a top secondary school and JC in Bishan.
I grew up around teenagers who prided themselves on their academic performance, on their CCA performance, and believed strongly that they will become highly successful people in the future. I had 2 classmates in JC, now best friends, who told me that they will hit a million dollars in annual salary by the time they reach 35, both of whom went to Oxbridge. Every single straight-A type that I knew had this air of arrogance around them, because I truly believe that they believed that they were better than the rest of us, that they will unerringly turn out to be more successful than any of us.
There was this girl I met in J1. She was a quiet girl who was from a neighborhood secondary school who happened to be in the same OG and class as I was. She was really timorous, really shy. She didn't have the best grades, and was notorious for skipping CCA. I was always confused by how nonchalant she was about schoolwork, how she always copies my homework, and how I have never once seen her studying. She eventually retained, and I lost contact with her.
I was recently having coffee alone at a cafe. She was fiddling around with the POS system. I recognized her immediately because she looked exactly the same as she did in JC. She did her hair up the same way. I approached her to say hello, and she told a younger girl to make her a flat white, and she came to sit with me at my table.
We started chatting about the old days, and I found out she got BCCC/B at A-levels, and did business at SMU. It also turns out that she owns the cafe, along with 13 other F&B establishments in Singapore and JB. Her share of the profits in 2018? 2.7 million. I was speechless for a while. Meanwhile my friends who went to Oxbridge, one of whom on a PSC scholarship, are now civil servants, both earning just a little between 10-15K a month. That's a good salary, but I was mediocre in JC (ABBC/A) and even I am earning more than 15K as a management consultant.
We have created a system of flawed meritocracy where children are brought up believing that just because you are the best in school, you're always going to be best in life. The logic is flawed because being the best in school just means you're going to be ""good"" in life. In most cases, you're just as likely as anyone to become ""great.""
If we think about it, kids become great in school because they understand the system well, and because there is generally a very clear methodology to become great. As long as you don't challenge the system, as long as you work within the ""rules,"" you'll come out on top. In the real world, there are several lines of work in which it is valuable to be able to work well within a system. The SAF for example. Probably explains why the word ""scholar"" always gets paired up with ""general"" in Singapore.
I think we, as a nation, need more humility when we think that the best people in school deserve more praise than any other student. People are good at different things, and school, being able to follow instructions to the hilt, is just one thing.

55250,94795,"5 months ago, as I was leaving my house for work and walking to the bus stop, I noticed a few strangers staring at me and avoiding me. As I was waiting for my bus, a woman who’s wearing a beige cardigan suddenly approached me and told me, “You forgot to wear mask.” I instinctively checked my pockets and backpack to see if I have a mask but realised I don’t have any. Seeing how anxious I was, she then asked me if I need a mask and proceeded to pass me an extra mask from her bag. As soon as she passed me the mask, her bus came and she quickly left. Since then, I started carrying extra masks in my bag.
A few weeks later, I saw a woman wearing a beige cardigan and I thought to myself that it could be the one who gave me a mask. Indeed it was her and so I decided to give her a new mask placed in a ziplock. I quickly wrote a Thank You note and put it inside the ziplock before giving her the ziplock. On the Thank You note, I wrote ""You gave me your mask a few weeks ago. Thank you so much. By the way, you're really cute! (:” and sneakily wrote down my number on the back of the note.
A few days later, I received a text saying, “Thank you for the mask! :)” To my surprise, it was her. I honestly did not expect that she would text me and I was so happy that she did. We then started texting and I realised she’s not just a pretty girl but also a very kind person. She’s also a preschool teacher and an active volunteer at animal shelters.
Eventually we started going out and I asked her to be my gf. But my mom doesn’t really like my gf as she thinks my gf is not pretty and quite fat and also 5 years older than me. It really saddens me that some of my friends and relatives have also commented the same thing. My sister even jokingly said that I have been blinded by love.
To me, kindness is the most important quality in a person and it is what makes you beautiful. Every act of kindness counts, no matter how small. On the day I first met my gf, everyone avoided me like the plague because I wasn’t wearing a mask, everyone except my girlfriend. Not only did she not avoid me, she even gave me her mask.
To everyone else, my gf may be just an average-looking chubby girl but in my eyes, she’s the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. If being blinded by love feels like happiness then I would gladly choose to be blind.

55198,94676,"Saw the recent story about the girl who asked her bf for money and she reminded me of myself. I’m just like her, a very materialistic girl.
I grew up in a low income family where my parents worked hard to give me a better childhood than the ones they had. They grew up in poverty and were forced to quit their primary schools to go out to work and help support their families.
Growing up, my mom has always encouraged me to study hard and get into the top university, not because she wanted me to find a good job but because she wanted me to find a rich boyfriend. She believed that rich kids would often study at the best schools and entering these schools would give me an opportunity to meet these rich kids.
Indeed my mom was right. When I entered university, I met my first boyfriend, who was a typical rich kid. His parents owned a construction firm and he was the oldest child and would take over the company in future. He was perfect in every way and we loved each other deeply and wanted to get married after we graduate.
After graduating, we went around looking at houses. One day he saw a house he fancied and told me how he would love to live in it. Since then, I started to feel uneasy whenever I saw him. But I convinced myself that I was making the right decision to marry him because he’s handsome and rich and he loves me so much. What could go wrong?
The day after he told his family about the house he fancied, I started to panic and suddenly I broke down in tears and told him I want to break up with him. He cried and begged me to reconsider my decision but I lied to him that I don’t like his parents and can’t get along with them. Nevertheless, he tried to win me back until I decided to lie to him that I found a new boyfriend.
After everything that happened, I realised I fell in love with his money, not him. I did everything I could to make him happy, not because I love him but because I wanted him to love me and give me everything.
I was so wrong to think that money can buy me happiness. Strangely, when he brought me to all the top fine dining restaurants, all the condo showrooms to choose our house and the high end jewellery boutiques to choose my rings, I didn’t feel happy at all. Everything just felt like an achievement unlocked, an ego booster. Fortunately, I hesitated and did not buy any ring or house with him.
For a very long time, I could not forgive myself for breaking his heart. I would often ask our mutual friends to check on him until I heard he found a new girlfriend. About a year later, I met someone new and I could finally move on and forgive myself.
Just like me, my current boyfriend came from a poor background and we were colleagues at a small firm. Our dates were routine and simple, we would eat at the McDonald’s opposite my house or buy Campbell soup from Giant and cook our own dinner. Life was simple but those were the best days of my life.
Ever since my boyfriend found a new job that requires more OT, he has been very busy. However, he still finds time to meet me and surprises me with food I love. A few months ago, he brought me to the same jewellery store which my ex brought me to and asked me to choose a ring. As I was looking at the rings, I felt like the rings are so beautiful. However, I told him I would rather he save up the money for our BTO renovation and warned him that I would return the ring if he ever bought it. Today, he surprised me with a proposal and proposed to me with the ring he bought from the store we visited.
The truth is he has been saving up for the ring for a very long time and he even changed his job to earn more money so he can afford the ring. He’s not a romantic person but he asked his married friends for advice and did a lot of research to give me the best proposal I have ever seen.
Some years ago, I stepped into the same jewellery shop and felt a sense of emptiness. The ring was beautiful but it did not make me feel anything. Some years later, I am wearing the same ring but I feel like the happiest girl in the world.
It was never about the ring. It is the person you are with that matters.

55316,94971,"In regards to #94924, hi I’m that rude and arrogant blind date. Yes, it sadly (for me) wasn’t a troll post.
I’m gonna ignore the 2/10 rating but thank you for rating me a 9/10, I really appreciate it. Working towards a 10/10 as we speak ????.
Likewise, the moment you opened your stupid fat mouth, you became a 2/10 too.
Also I would just like to let people know that it was your mum who approached mine asking if I would be willing to go on a blind date with you. I honestly didn’t even want to go nor waste my time and money in the first place.
Now let’s start spilling the actual tea ya.
Point 1. Thank you for pointing out my youthful and young looks. Not sure how you interpreted my awkward smile to compliments as a “hard stare” but no, I didn’t stare at you. I literally smiled. Stop making shit up luv.
Point 2. Ah yes, I did rudely stare at you for this. Yes, it’s a male-dominated industry, but I’ve not let gender get in the way of what I love to study and hopefully do in the future. Next time close both eyes and not say anything about it.
Point 3. Honestly at this point I was getting pretty annoyed and fed up. Am I really just supposed to sit there and accept that sexist comment?? Lmao absolutely not.
Point 4. How the fuck am I an overachiever for taking a double degree so that I’m able to get a well-paying job in the future? Men don’t like overachievers? Nah, I think it’s boys like you who can’t stand independent women that can provide for themselves because you feel insecure and inferior that a woman is earning more than you.
Point 5. Awww your small cock energy is showing here ????. You got free lunch even after giving me shitty advice that I didn’t ask for and for pointing out that I’m a 9/10 on the internet as an anonymous coward just because I’m not skinny enough for your standards, while I wasted $25-30. Should I invoice you for your half of the fucking meal?
I too hope to never cross paths with you ever again as well. I hope your already small dick shrinks up every single time you think about our stupid date.
From your post, it is also very clear how you have never lifted a finger to do a single chore in your entire pathetic existence. Stating how I can’t cook, clean, or look after my future spouse just because I don’t want to be a housewife, it’s clear you want one just so you won’t have to do anything at home. If you expect your wife to set up a whole ass meal, scoop your food, do all the chores in the house and take care of you, either get a maid or live under your mum’s armpit for the rest of your life.
My attitude mirrors yours. If mine was terrible then imagine how yours was that I couldn’t even continue to sit through the shitty date any longer than I have to.
I don’t feel like an asshole for leaving you honestly. Your mum called mine to say that I was rude for leaving you by the way. I guess it’s only fair that my dad calls yours to make sure he knows of his son’s misogynistic and shitty behaviour.
Good luck to whoever the fuck is crazy enough to date or marry you. I’d like to be a partner, not a maid or nanny for an overgrown man child. ????

56420,97753,"Last week a guy i was on a date(set up by my friend) he mocked my family .
He first when on a rant or long explanation or story to put it
He told me he was form Jc(a top one at that)
Then he went on about how he wants to save $1M by age 30 he's like 27M and working in a bank . I on the other had am just 22F
He then explained how his father is so and so and has a PhD and how he lives in one of those huge ass bungolws I think he used the term GBB or GCB
So then I asked him oh what's that ,he then replied its just a big bungolw ,you don't know ah? Its quite a high ses thing, not many know
He even treated the waiter badly asking him to 'come here' ,no pls no tq or anything.
He then asked what my parents do ,I said oh they are hawkers...
His face changed he asked so you are doing this degree(medicine) to get out of poverty huh .?
I said no I am not i genuinely want to help people out ,why do you think that? I said softy holding in my disgust
He said well you're from poly and your family probably doesn't earn much...and must be not so educated so thats why you want to become a doctor?
Softy again I said ,no I don't think you can stereotype that way
You must be a minority of med students who want to help..thats good he said .
Yeah,I said
Halfway he asked if he can send me home ,I told him no need (I wanted the date to end asap)
He said well I have a lamborghini you know
No thanks ,I'll take train can liao
But I bet you haven't been in one cause your poor he said loudly.
This pissed me off,
I told him ,why you no money buy your own car is it its clearly your dad's car!
Do you think a small ass car will impress me?
Why must I go with you ?
Why did you assume i am poor? You think so so big ah?
He then replied
i probably can buy your parents hawker stall.
You poor girl, you're just a gold digging bi**h
You think you are my standard?
I then replied
Stalls !! my family owns a few hakwer stalls
Don't ever judge again you disgusting son of a boofon, idk how that slipped out but I was indeed pissed.
I slaped him and walked off ,leaving $30 to the cahsier for my order
Can't believe that there are guys like this...
Seriously wtf sia ,why do some guys drive daddys car and say its theirs and think that their parents wealth is their's???
Ps. My mom graduated from a top culinary school, my dad is also a uni gardaute
And please don't look down at hawkers, having worked at my parents stall ,I've seen uncles who are primary 3 dropouts who earn millions and yet they are humble and give out food to needy on weekends, and they take in like $5000 a day ,selling drinks only....
So damm pissed, I don't think I will be dating for a while .

56799,98938,"Dear Prof. Ben,
Since you went to RI, I’m sure you would have gotten to know some classmates/schoolmates who have now become wildly successful in their careers. And by wildly successful, I do mean very wealthy. I also don’t mean the punch-cards who are working upper-middle class jobs, being paid upper-middle class wages. I mean those who are being paid millions a year, or entrepreneurs whose businesses are making millions a year in profit.
Since you were probably at the top of your cohort, do you secretly wish that you “deserve” more success than you have now? Or that they don’t deserve the wealth they’ve accumulated for not being as smart (or as hardworking) as you were in high school or in college?
I ask this question because I went to Hwa Chong and I was among the top of my cohort. I pursued academia at first, because it was what I was really good at (just generally learning stuff deeply). I dragged my ass through grad school and ended up doing dead-end research for 5 years before I started a job in the industry (CS) where I was paid the same as people 10 years my junior, doing work that to me, is in all sense of the word—stupid.
I have some ex-classmates who are now living in detached houses around Bukit Timah, driving luxury cars, one of whom was a middling student who used to copy my homework (he was smart just lazy). Almost every one of my crazy-rich ex-classmates are business owners, none of whom were particularly talented back in Hwa Chong.
Maybe wealth doesn’t mean much to you, but I was hoping you could help me reconcile being one of the smartest person in school and now having to capitulate to the reality there’s little profit in being so academically-inclined.

56789,98889,"I am a 27 (F) working in the town area. I would rate myself decent-looking and have had several ex-es who looks pretty good. A month back my company hired a new colleague who is 28 (M). My first impression towards him based on his appearances weren’t very good to be honest. He is not very tall (16-ish), nerdy-looking with an outdated hairstyle. He always goes out to lunch alone, probably because he’s shy and have not blended in yet. I tried my best to avoid him around work (I felt so guilty right now about that) but because of work-related issues, I can’t avoid him completely. There were times he consulted me and I had to teach him.
Only just very recently, out of total coincidence, I found out his daily routine during our lunch break and after work. There will always be an old aunty selling tissues in a corner during lunch break and she always almost get ignored by the passer-bys, but this colleague of mine, he always gets her a cup of coffee/hot milo and buys her tissue packs at an overpaid price. I saw this while I was behind him heading to the same place for lunch. He would even tell the aunty he will be back later after work to see her. I was astonished. I later found out he literally does that everyday he is in the office. The packs of tissues purchased are now all stacked up neatly in his drawer.
There was also another incident at work whereby he got reprimanded for doing the wrong things. I soon realised what he did were actually all instructed and taught by me. I thought he would tell on me but he just kept quiet throughout the entire lecture. When he came out, I hurriedly went over to apologise and all he said was, ‘it’s okay’ and gave me a wide smile. That was one of the brightest and genuine smile I have seen in my entire life. I feel that I have developed feelings for him although his appearances is entirely not my type. I feel that I can actually bypass all these judgemental impressions of mine of a person because of his character for the first time in my life.
Please tell me how do I make my feelings known for him in a subtle way? I don’t think he has much confidence in himself and would definitely not be the one to initiate or confess. For the rest of the ladies out there, please take my heed. Looks are only temporal. What stays is the heart and mind. His heart is greater than everyone’s else.

56809,98985,"I just want to thank Prof. Ben for reminding me (and us) that life is only a rat race if you choose to live it that way. His advice on this forum has saved me from implosion by leading me to make a life-changing decision to give up a high-paying job that I absolutely hated, in exchange for a job that I was okay with, a job that paid me an above-average (comfortable) salary, but a job that ultimately allowed me to spend more time with my wife and daughter.
Dear Proffy,
I went to RJ like you did. I studied CS (and applied math) like you did (albeit at Berkeley). My parents paid through their noses for me to go.
My wife was my childhood friend. Our mothers were very close friends and we practically grew up together. When I decided to leave for California, I had already been dating her. I knew then that I was going to marry her. She knew too. In my mind, I felt that I had a responsibility to earn as much money as I could so I can give her the best life she could ever have asked for. But I never asked her what she wanted.
I came back for a few years after graduating to work at a stat board, but I wasn't able to make a lot of money. I got married, had a beautiful daughter, but we were living in a HDB and I wanted better for my family.
Partly through my college connections, I got a job at a FAANG. I discussed it over with my wife, and she agreed to let me go. She has a really mild personality and she tends to bottle everything in. In hindsight I should've sensed that she was heartbroken, but I was too distracted by a need to give her the best life that I could that I didn't realize the fact that all she wanted was just to have me around. I left for the valley and I spent 4 years there. I tried to come back as often as I could.
I hated that job. I won't go into details about why I hated it, but I now understand that it wasn't just the job, I was just in a really self-destructive headspace. I was never from a very wealthy family and my expenses are very low. But after I got married my whole outlook changed. I wanted to be able to afford the best, not for me, but for my wife and kid.
After 4 years of missing my family every second of every day, I decided to come home. I now work for GovTech, doing boring stuff, but I am happy every day because I get to go to sleep with my wife by my side. I get to watch my daughter grow up.
No amount of money ever bought a second of time.

55035,94244,"I am a 23 year old Singaporean Chinese girl. Nice looking and I am single by choice. I have rejected dates so far because I felt I want to spend my time helping people.
What happened recently made me sad. I dont think I did the wrong thing. I am not sure why people I told to pass negative comments.
I was taking the train home when I noticed a Indian man crying silently in the train. He was trying to hide it but it was clear to me. I took a seat next to him and asked him if he is okay. He did not respond. So I stood up and hugged him close to my chest. Then he started to cry more and more audiably. It was messy indeed with tears and mucus. But it did not bother me. I was more concerned he may end his life or do something drastic. I kept hugging him till the end of the journey. By this time he was rather quiet. I looked at him and he seemed tired from crying. He managed to force some smile and thanked me. He told me he was planning to end his life that day as he had a number of problems from family to financial. He said he did not know nice people like me existed. He said he sees the world differently and he will now try to live and press on.
To be frank this made me feel really good. I was really filled with joy because I felt I stopped someone from taking his life away. I felt I gave him something to live forward. Maybe for the first time he realised that a stranger can care for him a lot also.
Now the problem is my family and friends. They make comments like ""What if he molested you?"" Or things like ""An Indian, you like black issit?"". I feel sad getting all these negative comments. I would have given a hug no matter who it is - old or young, ugly or handsome, ugly or pretty, male or female. Race is also not an issue for me.
I need validation that I did the right thing. So I post it online.

55359,95052,"Hi guys, I would like to please appeal to the public TO PLEASE GIVE WAY TO AMBULANCES.
I used to work as a paramedic in the army, and now I’m working as a junior doctor. I am mentioning my credentials because I hope to appeal to the public by giving yall a real recount of what happens behind the scenes.
Recently on the news, there was an article of an ambulance crashing into a car at Tuas (with the siren on), and it is really disheartening to see the Facebook comments section filled with “ambulance then can anyhow drive?” or many personal recounts of how ambulances drive recklessly on the road. Sure, there may be SOME instances of ambulances abusing their power, but why is the heck is that our first reaction to such news? Then again, even though I do fully understand that Fb comments are not the thoughts of majority, I would like to appeal to us young ones to do the right thing (if we are not already doing so)
When I was a paramedic, I saw deaths on a weekly basis. When I worked at the emergency department as a junior doctor, I saw deaths on a daily basis. The scene of family members crying and being in denial over the news of death is not something that anyone can ever get used to. It is heart wrenching, and for me to see those comments by fellow citizens really irks me. When the siren in the ambulances are switched on, the patient is in CRITICAL CONDITION, and every SECOND that he/she arrives at the emergency will lead to a much better prognosis.
So what if the ambulance is driving recklessly? Do you think the ambulance driver likes to drive like that for fun? I have sat in an ambulance for 1.5 years during my army days, and I can safely tell you that no one, absolutely no driver, will do that for fun. We all have families to go back home to, we all have a responsibility to be safe on the roads as well, but more importantly, we owe the patients a duty of care that they deserve. And if ensuring the patient goes to the hospital earlier and survives, rest be assured the driver is going to be more “reckless” (for the lack of a better word).
Dear young readers who are reading this, if your reaction to an ambulance getting into an accident is “what a reckless driver”, or “red light how I give way why the ambulance horn me” then you should really change your mindset. If your car is stopped in front of an ambulance in front of a red light, you can always move your car in front of the stop line, go ahead of the first car in the other lanes, and let the ambulance pass you. Nobody is asking you to run a red light, or to try and predict what an ambulance does on the road. All I’m asking for is more empathy, empathy for the patient that is suffering in the ambulance, empathy for the patient’s family who are in worried sick, and empathy for the driver who is trying his absolute best to reach his destination.
We are a first world country, but in terms of our civic mindedness, we are still far from it. Please do consider my open appeal to all you readers. The patient in the ambulance could be your loved ones one day. Thank you all for reading till the end!

56822,99023,"Why are some Singaporeans so fixated with Joseph Schooling doing his NS?
All these comments about how Joseph should be sent to Tekong makes it sound like he was trying to chao keng his way out of Tekong?!
Lets be real, Olympic training is 1000x harder than any NS training. If you look at the typical training schedule of an Olympian, it is intense! And it doesn't just go on for 2 years. They do it since young and for over a decade!
In my opinion, Joseph should be exempted from NS. By winning Singapore's ONLY Olympic gold medal. That in itself, should qualify as National Service.
Even though he didn't perform up to expectations at this year's Olympics, so what? He has contributed more to the nation than any NS man already. Better to send him back to US to train properly for the next Olympics than waste his youth in Tekong, which will effectively kill his swimming career.

1. Not every girl wants to get married by 23. So before you ASSUME she's of marriageable age, ask her what her views on marriage are. One hint, might save you the drama- just because she does not want to get married now does not mean she never will. She has other plans for herself right now, let her live a little.
2. Just because a girl wishes to do her PhD after Masters does not mean she doesn't want to settle down in life. Give her a break, and respect the fact that she has the confidence to take that up, cos yeah, PhD is no joke. There will come a point when she would happily devote herself to her family, and balance it out with her work life. Her degrees, or lack of them, won't make any difference. Let her study while she wants to, okay?
3. Just because she is 27 and unmarried does not mean she's been rejected by many men. Maybe, being single is a choice she has made.
4. Having a boyfriend does not make her characterless.
5. Just because she has recently gone through a break up doesn't mean she is vulnerable and available.
6. Just because most of her friends are boys, does not mean she is ""having a good time"" with all of them.
7. Just because she has a drink in her hand does not mean she is an alcoholic.
8. Just because she wore a short skirt to one party does not mean she dresses up that way every day.
9. Just because she is ambitious doesn't mean she isn't a family person.
10. Just because she doesn't discuss her plans doesn't mean she's clueless about life. Give her a chance, alright?
11. Just because she is outspoken doesn't mean she is a rebel.
12. Just because she comes home late from work does not mean she is sleeping around with her colleagues.
13. After a hectic week, give her some time to relax over the weekend. Don't make that one weekend party make her look like a she's a frivolous party-girl without a job.
14. Just because she is out shopping alone does not mean she is depressed or lonely. It's how she relaxes, respect that.
15. Just because she is on a holiday alone does not mean she doesn't have company. Maybe it's a break to get back her lost confidence, or maybe that's how she is. Admire her spirit instead of giving her advice, okay?
16. Just because she is a woman doesn't mean she can't kick ass in military school.
17. Just because she has a tattoo doesn't mean she is attention seeking. Maybe that's her way of expression.
18. Just because she doesn't know how to cook doesn't mean she won't make a good wife. Remember when you were just married and cooked chicken curry which was um, a disaster?
19. Just because she likes everything pink and shiny and fluffy doesn't mean she lives in her own world. She can handle some situations much better than her male counterparts.
20. Just because she is pretty does not mean she is a whore. And just because she is friendly does not mean she is flirting with you.
21. Just because she has a short hair, doesn't mean she's not interested in man. Everyone has their own taste on styling, and that is her; short hair and boyish style. Let her express herself. Don't judge her sexuality based on how she dress. Please !(credit to Cornelia M Asinti)
Yes, we cry, we are emotional; we take things personally, and sometimes over-react to situations. But this does not give any one the right to judge us in the wrong way. Times are changing; don't confine her within those boundaries, no matter how orthodox you are. There are some who might be fighting this losing battle, yet compromising on their decisions and plans, just to please society.

56752,98792,"For those who are considering joining the real estate industry as a real estate agent; PLEASE I urge u to think twice. Especially if you’re leaving a stable salaried job to do this.
Don’t be fooled by the posts of your friend posting their awards & fancy cars and shit on social media and think it’s so easy. It’s not.
Don’t get brainwashed by the managers who are trying to recruit you that it’s such good money and that you can also do it. They earn an overriding commission from their team members so of course the more the merrier. My team manager makes $30-60k a month alone on his team overriding commission; and that’s on top of his own sales. Don’t forget that these people are highly skilled salesmen who can sell ice to eskimos.
The reality is that only the TOP 1-5% of ALL agents make good money & the rest are barely making it. I am not exaggerating. The people in the Top 5% are making all the money.
If you’re not in the Top 5%, u can totally forget about it. There’s over 30,000 agents in Singapore- u do the Maths.
In my first 2-3years, I burned through all my hard earned savings on PropertyGuru credits (I think burned about 5k), various training courses (3k here and 6k there), various apps & misc expenses.
Besides PropertyGuru, there’s also EdgeProp & 99.co- also need to buy credits.
Another 20-30k burned on Facebook & Google Ads.
In this industry you will burn a lot of money first (easily 20k or more in your first year) before u even make your first cent.
If you do not have at least 12 months of expenses saved PLUS min $20k for all these necessary expenses, don’t even consider it.
That’s not the worst part. Just because u burn money on PropertyGuru, Facebook & Google Ads doesn’t mean u will get genuine leads.
95% of all your leads are time wasters. They don’t respond when u contact them. Msg never reply. Or they will make appointment with you & then never show up. A lot of people who fill up your lead form on Facebook are just bored and have no genuine intention to sell or buy property. Cold leads from online marketing are almost impossible to close. Most of them are just “look see only”. I spent over $20k to learn this the hard way. Don’t be like me.
I cannot tell u how many times people have flown my plane. I travel down to the location and waited for an hour & the person never show up.
If you’re a woman, you’ll constantly get harassed by nuisance calls and texts by random male strangers. Because our contact number is readily available online, many men will think it’s okay to take your number and abuse it freely. Pretend to be a buyer interested to buy property, and then after wasting your time for hours, ask if you’re single.
Everyday I will get at least one dodgy text or DM from some creepy anonymous male stranger on various platforms. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
This year after deducting expenses, not only did I not make any $$, I lost around $15-20k.
It’s depressing to think that the people working in McD & cleaners actually earn more than me.
The truth is- You’ll HATE the job UNLESS you’re a natural salesman who genuinely loves interacting with people. The key words being “GENUINELY LOVES”.
I am an introvert, I hate going out, I hate interacting with people in general and I suffer everyday in this job.
So please take my advice. Don’t do it. It’s very painful & not as lucrative as many people think.
Most agents make around $50-100k a year? Might as well stick to a regular day job with CPF and benefits.
The real perk is the security of knowing u have a fixed paycheck coming in every month.
The dumbest thing one can do is leave a stable salaried job for this fucking “job” where U actually have to pay money to do shit U hate & talk to people u can’t stand, everyday going around for viewing after viewing after viewing like a free fucking tour guide.
People don’t care about wasting your time, cos you’re just an agent.
Nobody will tell u this shit because frankly those who are struggling won’t admit to anyone they’re struggling, and the few who are doing very well won’t understand why you’re struggling.
I just wish somebody had told me this shit years ago.

56607,98390,"I am in my early 30s and with my secured jobscope that I have, I am earning more than the median salary for high incomers. Despite of all things that I own with my hardwork (condos, cars, investment), there are one thing that I would never forget which is my own parents. With their ageing nature in late 60s, I am always worried on how would I survive in the future without them as they are staying with me and I am still unmarried.
The fact that I am financially supporting them in a consistent manner, there is one thing that I would never forget about my parents. Whenever I wanted to go out to work, my father would always give me pocket money like $10 and my mom would always prepare a packed meal for me to eat at workplace. It is not that I am totally dependent on them, but it’s their daily routine since I was a child.
During Father’s day, I did asked my parents while we were having dinner at home why they are still giving my pocket money and pack a meal for me. My father’s answer shocked me,
“You are the only children for both of us, no matter how grown up you are, how much money that you gave to both of us, how good is the home that you bought for all of us and stayed together, you are still a child to us. We came from poor families and you made our life comfortable. We wanted to cherish our time together while we are still alive. You want it too right?”
Putting the right palm on my eyes, I tried to hold the tears while nodding as the answer for the question. My mom besides me started to cry while caressing my shoulder. Then I looked at their face with such a pure bliss, I didn’t know what did I do in my past life to deserve such a heavenly parents.
“Should you get a gf now?” All burst into laughter while my mom asked.

56716,98685,"I’m a woman who found my husband late (at 32) and I just wanna say to all those 30-and-above who are looking for the right man, these things take time and it is okay to be single.
I dated 2 guys before him and they weren’t right for me. Commitment was the main thing they, as well as many guys nowadays, lack. My definition of commitment is very simple, there needs to be an understanding that once you decide to be with someone, you will be faithful to them until you die. I don’t want to have to hear all this crap about having platonic female friends whom you hang out with more than you hang out with me, or liking and following Instababes. I’m old-fashioned that way. Once you’re with me, you commit to me and I commit to you, forever. Otherwise the whole marriage/relationship thing is pointless.
My husband has had a crush on me since we were in JC. He did not have a single girlfriend since he confessed to me then. We got together at the age of 28, 10 years after our awkward encounter as teenagers. I wasn’t even in his class. We just had a mutual friend.
After JC we didn’t speak for a couple of years until we bumped into each other in Europe. That was when I realized maybe we were really meant to be with each other. And then our mutual friend told me he has been asking about me every time they met for 10 whole years. No he didn’t reach out to me for 10 years, and he said because he didn’t want me to be uncomfortable because I was always with someone else.
So far, he has been the best husband any girl could ever ask for. He lets me do whatever I want, he supports me, he spends time with me, he insists that he washes the dishes, he does laundry, he irons my work clothes, basically he just trusts and loves me completely. Every morning, the first thing he does when I wake up is he will gently kiss me on my shoulder. He has done that every day since we moved in together. I don’t know man. I just know I’m never leaving him.
I think sometimes we marry the people we love and other times we love the people we marry. With my husband, I think I fall in love with him a little more every day I’m with him and now I’m completely obsessed with him. I can’t sleep without having him next to me, and every time I go on overseas work trips for just a few days I’d cry in my hotel room because I’d just miss him so much.
If you don’t find someone good, don’t waste your time. But if someone good comes along, know that even if you don’t like him right away, there’s a chance you might be after a while.

57024,99590,"Now is the season when fresh grads enter job market right? Come let gor gor here teach y'all a few Pippo(tips) to acclimatise to the working world:
1. Have good relationships with the secretaries. Very important. They know where the stationery are, which catering companies to look at when you need to plan events. Which executive to look for in another department. Befriend the secretaries. Treat them like goddesses. Cos you never know, your next meeting session with their bosses rest in their hands.
2. Don't be alarmed when you are told to change your slide design. Accept the fact that each manager has a penchant for specific fonts for titles and subtitles. I will always remember my ex boss. Title don't 16, subtitle font 14, content font 12. Redo. Dumbfounded. Also, if you work in a big corporation, ask your colleagues if there are company slide templates. Viola. No need to search and do up fancy slides. Company presentations don't care about zooming in and out of slides. Fancy animations and all. Who has the time to care about how aesthetically appealing your background is. What's more important is the content. Clear and easy to understand please.
3. Learn the ropes as fast as you can. Keep asking since you are fresh. Once you are not fresh, and you still ask a lot of questions, they will start to question your question. In some situations however, if you are not taught something, it's still ok to ask.
4. In some companies, believe it or not, deeply rooted traditions still exist. Classic example: don't leave on the dot at 6pm even if you've finished your work. Dilly dally a bit more. Maybe around 15 to 30 mins then zao. You know the answer to this right. Don't need to explain much.
5. Forgot to say this. Really really. Be good friends with your colleagues. Non managerial ones. They will be your source of support, comfort and office politics gossip. Who shouts at who before, who more approachable. Who is who where is where. How to connect printer to your laptop. How to submit request for stuff in the portal. Colleagues are super important when you don't want to appear like you know nothing. Why? If you keep asking your manager questions, he or she might think that you are not attentive when they are teaching you. But in the first place you are not taught that thing, or you didn't manage to jot it down in time. In this case, ask your colleagues. Confirm one of them know. 5 colleagues? Ask each of them in a rotation fashion. One question per week for each person if you need to. This way, they also won't think you are a nuisance.
6. Make full use of pantry if there is one. Gope the biscuits and snacks. You will need it for OT and when you skip lunch to rush the report.
7. Don't be gehkiang and be too outspoken. Newbies in the industry. Be quiet and observe. Speak up only when you have some grasp of how the department or industry works. Don't laokui (embarrassed) yourself in front of people especially in meetings. They tell you to speak up, but they want constructive and pertinent comments, not some elementary and basic queries that can be easily resolved offline or in emails. So, have questions? Ask your direct colleagues or staff. Not in meetings, not unless you know what the rest are doing.
8. Dept lunches. First few weeks you cannot escape. Tahan. Just tahan. I know you want to be alone. Watch your drama during lunch. But just tahan. Wait for a few weeks. Then slowly ease out of your lunch existence. Excuses can be busy with work, brought lunch already. Why cannot eat alone on first week? Remember connections? Yes. Build connections first. You need to know where that stapler is. Lunch breaks are important channels to pose queries. Make use of them.
9. They say don't anticipate. But I say do it. Always be a worry cat. Always think of what's to come next. Don't be too optimistic about stuff. Always be prepared to be rejected on the first draft. You can give it your all on the first try, but be prepared. Your all is not their all. Anticipate. Brace yourself for rejection. Strive on.
10. Lastly, after all the office survival tips, this might just be the most essential one. Know the food around. Know what the options are. Is there a cafe? Is there a bakery? Is there a kopitiam? Feeling splurgy? Order that latte. Feeling thrifty. Buy that 3 dollar cai png. Some places even have staff discount. On tight budget? Know where the convenience store is. Sometimes they have cheap offers. Know your food options. That's the least you can do to tahan through the rest of the afternoon until you knock off.
Happy working.

Recently I went out cycling alone as a girl, it was very tough at night and I had already cycled about 70km at this point.
Suddenly, the chain came off and I sat there at the bus stop, hopeless it's like 1am and no one is around.
After about 15 mins I saw this Indian beard guy come toward the bus stop, tbh I was a bit scared.
Then he asked ""ms are you ok? "" I told him no, my chain came off.
He then said ok I can help you and in about a minute he fixed it back, despite getting grease all over his hands he got up and said I'll leave you to it, ride safe.
I thanked him and we had some small talk for a while and then he said he had to go, I forgot his name.
But all I can remember is he had a bandana like a thing over his head and he was wearing a bright orange polo with the words kabun.....on it
So Mr kind Samaritan if you see this please come to the cafe I recommended you to where I had a break and tell the guy what colour jersey I was wearing, and coffee is on me.
And thanks so much for your kindness
Best and hugs

56336,97480,"Singaporeans, a majority of only worry about career and money and relationships the latter usually ignored.
I graduated with a law degree overseas ten years ago, aged 31.
I married a woman whom I loved a lot.
At this time, I was living in a bungalow that my wife and I bought, I had a lucrative business on the side which I had sold a majority of.
I secured a job at a law firm and after a year or so of 80-hour work weeks,
I then secured a job as a counsel to a large MNC based in Europe.
On a 2-year contract
I left sg chasing a $1,200,000 a month job I was working 19 hours a day. I never replied to my parents calls nor my wife’s.
I missed the birth of my son who died shortly after he was born.
I didn't come back; I had no choice our firm was in the middle of a crisis.
And I dare not face my family.
To cover my grief, I kept working, I slept in the office and also sold off all my shares worth about $30,000,000 for $1 in the same I stared to my best friend, as she was the one I trusted the most to lead the firm also I had no interest in anything.
After I had settled all the issues at work, I ended the contract and had to pay some money for ending it early, I also had to help find a replacement.
I flew back the same day I handed in my letter to the firm.
When I came home, I found a letter from my wife, she had left me, we then got a divorce.
I did all this for my family they had a good life in my opinion.
I sent my parents for holidays almost every month, I sent about.
50% of my income back to them.
The remaining would usually be sent to charities.
I paid of my sibling’s medical school fees too.
And the rest to my wife, she got to live as a tai tai, over the years she spent almost $1,200,000 just on cars and Designer stuff.
These are things I had no interest in but in my mind, I believed they kept my family happy.
But no, I lost my family too.
who moved overseas, they rarely spoke to me?
I chased money the almost all the Cs except country club (totally hate most people there)
All for my family, I think I never spent more than a day with them those few years.
2 years ago, I found out form my in laws my wife had died (I will not specify how) but it was a dagger trough my heart, as I had intended to rekindle our love.
I then wandered about for a year ...
I have fixed my relationship with my parents who are now in their 70s, they are volunteer teachers, and they spend their time teaching students and helping build schools overseas, they had sold their own home to do this.
I let go of everything 30% my money I put in a trust that will be used for charitable causes after I die 20%, I put aside for my SME that I founded to use, if I times of crisis.
The remaining 50% I gave it away, I also gave away all the proceeds firm the sale of all my cars and homes and investments.
I happy now, I help with my parents. And I work as a pro bono lawyer too.
I still cry every night hoping I was not that rich that way my child may not have died.
And my wife would be still with me.
All the material stuff did not bring me any happiness, only for a second. After that no... just sadness
What's worse is that I lost many good friends, and I didn't know and couldn't tell who my friends are back then.
Please my fellow Singaporeans success
Is best earned and achieved when you find true happiness and you have done your level best to contribute to society and made a positive difference in people’s lives.
That will bring you much more happiness. Then any amount of money will.
There is so much more to see and to do, let us not be blinded and distracted.
by monetary and material gains
Instead, please focus on your family, your children’s parents and passions you want to peruse.
I hope we can start to value people better rather than who earns the most. or who has a degree or what not.
I will give an example.
In Singapore we see a Mercedes-Benz, oh wow we go that person must have lots of $$ and likely is successful.
In Germany, people see a Mercedes-Benz, “oh look that's my taxi.""
regards,
A Singaporean who spent 40 years chasing something that truly does not bring value.

After interview for a government job which requires replacement ASAP, I sensed they like to employ me so when they ask what salary do I expect, I said 4.5k (which in fact most peers I know is <$4k for fresh grad). The job has shifts so I only need to work 3-4 days per week, 9-5, but should remain contactable on other days when I at home.
Next day HR calls me saying I am hired but they like to discuss on the salary. They asked what other offers I got, I said I have one with 3.7k
Then later the day they called me saying they offer me 3.8k
At this point, I took a bet, telling them initially we mentioned 4.5k, now your 3.8k offer I can't accept it, so my terms is: either you pay me 4.3k minimum or we say goodbye.
Guess what, next day HR called me saying they are willing to pay me 4.3k
My learning point is: HR don't pay you based on your worth or job scope, its a supply and demand problem. We're negotiating in business and just want to cut a deal

Few days back, I invited 3 friends to my apartment and I told them I'd be preparing chilli crab for them. They were so excited over the food and one even said it's her favourite dish. I bought 4 live sri lankan crabs home and waited for my friends to arrive before processing them because I wanted to keep the food fresh.
When my friends came, they were shocked that I bought live crabs. I told them it's for freshness. The friend who said chilli crab was her favourite dish started arguing with me, calling me a murderer.
I told her to look away and proceeded to kill the crabs swiftly with a knife up the bottom and she started crying. My other friends were split, with one supporting her and saying I'm a monster, while the other said I am just doing what every restaurant does.
I called her a hypocrite for eating crabs at a restaurant even though she can't stand the crabs being killed, and she couldn't come out with a proper reply. Needless to say the gathering sucked and she ran home crying with one other friend. This left the 2 of us to eat 4 crabs and it was absolutely delicious.
Animal cruelty starts at the dinner table and I admit I am cruel to animals for the sake of food. But at least I'm no hypocrite.

57425,100810,"Recently, my department welcomed a fresh grad. When asked if this is his first job, he said no. He was actually from an e-commerce company but left the organisation. I didn't probe too much into the details of his leaving. But I would just like to say that it's ok for fresh grads to feel pressured and stressed when they first start to work. It's also ok to see them leave their first job within a matter of months. In fact, it's normal. I too, was a classic case of leaving my first job after several months due to some matters.
Why is it ok? Fresh grads tend to have this mindset of what their ideal job should be. They aim and strive to create that perfect picture in their first job. But reality isn't always the case and setbacks and disappointments ensue, which cause them to leave the work. It's actually good, because now they know that the line of work doesn't really suit them, be it people, responsibilities or company vision, mission. Since they are young, they are able to bear a bit of the loss and search for another job.
If they get another offer, good for them. If they don't, then it's time to search hard. And this is also a lesson for them. To cherish and realise that their ideal job is not as realistic as they thought it to be. Then in their next line of work, they would be able to put aside such thoughts and focus.
People who think that these fresh grads are strawberry or durian generation. No they are not. They are just normal human beings that are still trying their best to navigate the working world, one that is already being ruled by laojiaos who set the rules as and how they want them to be, and these young people have no choice but to get used to it.
So let's not judge them and instead, support them. Teach them the things they need to do their work. Don't know much excel skills (most grads I know really know a few basics only because in uni, who uses excel often? It's all R, Python, Solidworks, Matlab, Arduino), teach them what you use.
They don't talk during department lunches. That's fine. It's their way to assimilate and trying to be a part of the group. Initiate conversations with them, get them to talk about themselves. And please, after a few months, there's really no need for department lunches. Sometimes, even I want my own time to just rest my head on the table in silence instead of faking smiles at the kopitiam table. Let them do their own things during lunch. You never know, they might be watching a drama that you are watching too. More things to talk about.
To all young and fresh grads, know that you are not alone, this guy here typing, and many others out there were just like y'all. Learn and absorb. Blend in well without losing yourselves. And always be courteous and reasonable, and pass down this attitude to the next generation of new people. Because like you, they will need your support.

57198,100018,"I went to a neighborhood secondary school and HCJC. I dropped out after a year because I disapproved of the grade-obsession. It was a terrible environment in which to learn. I may have been too stupid to do well at Hwa Chong, but a better excuse is I came from a high SES do-whatever-you-want family so there was very little emphasis on grades.
I entered community college in the US. The American education system turned out to be a good match for my style of learning and I transferred after 2 years to Penn. My Penn GPA was 3.92 in two majors, math and economics. I then did my masters at MIT.
When I tried to find a job in Singapore after graduation, it was odd to me that several employers (especially government-related) wanted me to explain my JC situation and why I never did A-levels. Why does it matter? I have accredited degrees with transcripts. Surely university records supersede anything anterior. Would they want to see my botched PSLE as well? I have a sub 200 PSLE.
Before deciding to come home, I had several offers for jobs at companies like Palantir and Two Sigma who didn’t care that I went to a community college. I came home because my dad had a stroke and I am his only son.
I did eventually find a job, and it wasn’t a particularly difficult process with my dad’s connections. But there’s something seriously wrong with this society if we think being a late bloomer is a supposed to be a stain on your record.

57094,99751,"If I were a parent, I would totally expose my children to sex education early.
Boy: to teach him how to wear a condom. How to make himself feel good aka masturbate. Maybe even introducing him to some tenga. It's normal to feel pleasure. Nothing to be embarrassed about.
Girl: even though I'm a guy, I'm still aware of the monthly menstrual cycle that ladies have. When that happens, don't even need to wait for the mother to appear. I'll bring her to the supermarket to buy pads. I've seen so many fathers and guys shun the pad section. Come on. It's like diapers. It absorbs stuff. What's so scary about it. The older generation thinks touching it is not good and suay but hello? It's a product please. I'll help her read reviews and what not to help her decide on the pad she wants. Similar to guys, I'll also tell her about condoms and safe sex. Always. ALWAYS make sure the guy wears a condom. No condom just kick the balls and go.
It's ok to teach children about sex at an early age, maybe around 16-18. It's the period when they explore and know more about their bodies. What's so embarrassing about it? Last but not least, I'll make an agreement with them: when you are at home, if you are doing something ordinary, like watching YouTube or Netflix, you can open door for air ventilation. If you want full on privacy to 'discover' yourself, close the door and lock it. If you are studying or working and don't want to be disturbed, close the door and leave it ajar a bit, using a door stopper. Not going to spy on you. Not going to harp on you. Just be sure that whatever you do, be safe and not harm anyone.
It's about time the conventional mindset of sex gets replaced with new ones. Oh and just a note, not even going to care if my children or lesbians or gays, love is all that matters. Peace out.

56811,98996,"At first I thought, hey Joseph. Why you never guard your gold? Why let other ppl take it from you? Then I went online to Google about the games. Saw some photos of him and did a compare and contrast with his photos from the past. Did he get bigger? Gained weight? Did it affect his performance? I started to think about what could have caused his loss.
Physique is one thing. Next comes the lane he's in when he was doing his heats. He was placed at the edge of the pool. I believe many of us have watched a lot of pool action, and would have noticed that most wins happen at the middle lanes. But Joseph was at a disadvantage. He got the last lane. Sure, all pools are the same. Water same. Environment same. But the feeling is just not the same. Y'all know what I mean? Being able to see your opponents left right is an important adrenaline pumper. But for his case, he was not able to..
Then I see ppl commenting on his body shape. I'm not sure of the gold standard body for swimming, but I compared his current form with Michael. Yeah the Michael he defeated. Michael is longer, a bit more streamlined, and leaner. Not entirely sure whether his current physique played a part, but I hope not? Because I'm pretty sure there are many nutritionists, coaches watching his weight and condition. So I'm not inclined to believe this point I saw online. And Joseph won Michael once too.
Which brings me to reality. Yes, we have to face it. His experience brought me, and I'm sure many of y'all, back to the days in uni. Before an exam, you think you put in all of your efforts. You gave your best. Studied your tutorials, redid your tutorials, consulted tutors and lecturers, rewatched lectures and discussed with friends. You practised for finals. Your progress looked great. You felt prepared! But fast forward a few weeks when the results came out. Hey..what happened? C? Not even a B? Then, that's when you knew. Effort and your 'best' do not always equate to success. Yeah it hurts.
You think you gave your all? Someone out there might be better than you. Someone in your major might put in more effort than you. Someone beside you might know more tips than you. You never know! You cry. You lament the harsh reality and unfairness of it all. C is a low pass. It will affect your CAP. Should you retake the course? Waste time on it again? Or focus on other courses?
It's what Joseph is experiencing now I guess. I'm very sure he put in his best effort. His coaches gave him their all too. He felt well prepared, he felt great and he felt that he could win again. But someone out there got the better of him.
From the initial skepticism and criticism within me to thinking about how his experience is just like any of ours years ago in uni, I feel a bit embarrassed. Too quick to judge. Too hasty and nitpicky. That's when I could feel his sadness within me, and I saw myself in my room again, holding onto my phone looking at the SMS results. C.
Joseph (like I'm your friend lol). Or anyone reading this, know that your best effort may not always work out. Yes, it's reality. Most of us have been through similar experiences, just not at an international level. Know that you are not alone. You have your friends. Your coach. Your family. And many of us back in sg waiting for you and cheering you on. You may not have the chance to bring back the gold this time. But I hope the next time when you meet your opponents in the pool, you bring together with you our support, our cheers and our passion with you. Your best effort is enough.
P.s. some people may think that prayers do not come into the picture. But hey, whatever that can help, I'm all for it.

55540,95458,"Am I the only one who is honestly very, very disturbed by the comments on FB these few days regarding the tanjong pagar accident?
5 young men died. They made mistakes, and paid with the ultimate price. The driver drove recklessly. The passengers chose to sit on his car. Whatever it is, they don't have the chance to amend their mistakes anymore. I watched the video in horror. I can't imagine being burnt to death in a car. All I thought of were my friends who drive and I sent them a reminder to drive safe.
Back to the point. Why are there so many comments mocking the dead? While many would say ""it's just the social media desensitizing people"", I disagree. People reveal their true selves when they can do it without consequences (anonymity). There are so many people out there who actually derive joy from a video of 5 people dying. Look at any straits times post and you'll see the majority of the reacts being ""haha"". It's not about putting ""kinder words"" online. It's about the true reaction to such news, and it really makes me feel sick.
Naturally this topic was discussed at my workplace and I had a colleague tell me that they deserved to die. I never lost respect for anyone faster. If I get a Lamborghini and offered you a ride and you accepted, now you suddenly deserve to die? What kind of warped logic is that? I have been in an acquaintance's car and I repeatedly asked him to slow down but he only drove faster to get the joy of frightening the wits out of me. So did I deserve to die then? Come on. I really hated him for doing that but still, I do not wish for him to die and I definitely will not say that he deserves death.
You may say I'm trying to be politically correct, but I will never derive joy from someone's demise. What difference is this from a thousand years ago where people stoned adulterers? Moreover, I'm pretty sure cheating on your spouse is more immoral than choosing to sit in your friend's new car.

57426,100814,"Do you ever think about your ex partner and wonder how they're doing?
For the record, I'm happily married, with a beautiful baby girl. My husband is loving, everything I could have ever wished for. My life is complete, beyond my dreams and I'm really grateful..
But today, while putting my baby girl to sleep, I suddenly realized that it must have been roughly 10 years since my first boyfriend had broken up with me. (My husband is my second)
I started to wonder how this first guy is. Not in a romantic kind of way but genuine concern as someone who had known him very well in the past.
You see, he's not a bad guy. At all. He just has all the bad luck. And I do wonder how he is from time to time, though I've no desire to get in contact. I genuinely hope things have looked up for him since.
The circumstances of our breakup was dramatic, though it was none of our fault. He's just plain unlucky.
We had been together about 5 years, throughout university, but he broke up with me the first year after we graduated and started working.
The following can probably be written into a mediacorp drama:
His family had always been fraught with problems. They're a working class family, with total of 4 brothers. He is no. 2. They could have had a good, middle class life but his father gambled to the point of having loanshark come to the house and to the office, causing him to lose his job.
Then his parents divorced, selling the flat to split assets. His father then became homeless, and my then boyfriend who was still in uni, had to fork out few hundreds a month from his part time tuition income to rent a bed for his dad.
I pitied him having to support his dad while the rest of his family moved to a HDB rental flat. By this time the other brothers had stopped contact with his dad, only my ex boyfriend was supporting him.
Wanting to save on university fees, he deliberately loaded on more modules so he could graduate a semester earlier and go to work to earn money to support his dad and family, with 2 younger brothers who were still schooling.
The last straw came one day when I was at work. By that time I had just started working a few months, so he could have been working for a year already.
I still remember I received a text from him, asking to meet me that night after work. I had period cramps and really wanted to go home to rest so I asked if we could meet another night. But no, he had something urgent to tell me. So we met at my void deck.
I still remember that night. He sat me down and told me everything...
He wanted to break up with me. Because his youngest brother, then in sec 3, had been kicked out of school for failing to turn up for the retake of his end of year exam. Yes, so he had failed once and had been retained. The school gave him another chance to come back for re-exam but in between, he had gone to lion dance, fallen and broken his collar bone, meaning he couldn't take the re exam since he couldn't write. So the school had called to kick him out. That was the last straw for my ex bf as his problems seemed unending and which led to his decision to break up with me.
Incredulous? The whole situation was incredulous to me. I cried and cried and cried. I didn't understand why it was me who had to suffer a break up when we both agreed I wasn't a problem to him.
He then told me everything else. He said he didn't want to burden me with all his family's problems so he had kept alot of the severity of the problems to himself.
But during the break up, he came clean and told me everything that had been plaguing him.
By that time, I hadn't seen his eldest brother for months. I did ask, but my then bf just made excuses. Only during the break up did he tell me that his elder brother had been caught taking drugs and had been either in jail or rehab (I can't rmb). I was shocked and so pained for him. This meant that he could no longer continue to work in insurance after his release, and the burden on my ex bf to support the family became even heavier.
He also told me, when his parents divorced and sold the flat, they split proceeds, and his dad went uncontactable for a week, apparently he had gone to Batam to gamble and came back after he lost heavily or most of it.
So yeap up until that point, I had been blissfully unaware of the severity of his family's problems and only knew that they divorced due to his gambling problem and that only my ex bf was supporting his dad by renting a bed space for him to stay.
I was stunned. And sad. We had talked about BTO, visited the show flat, discussed applying for the one at AMK etc. Everybody including me, thought we would end up together because that's just how we were.
And then as I sat crying and wailing, he told me he decided to break up with me because I was always a happy girl and he didn't want to burden me with his problems. So he didn't tell me alot of these things that plagued him. But when he had to meet me, he had to put up a happy front and he didn't want to anymore.
I was bewildered because yes im sheltered, but I'm not unhelpful or uncaring. I didn't understand why he had to hide his problems from me.
When his dad was homeless, I even suggested he move in with my own dad so as to save on rent.
My parents were and are separated, my dad stays alone in a house. So there was room for his dad. He did move in, but my dad is not easy-going. He has OCD and is very x100 naggy. So anyway, things didn't work out between the dads and his dad had a fall in the house and was warded and later diagnosed with kidney failure and needed dialysis.
Anyway so we broke up that night but I was distraught and kept pestering him, stalking him at his house and workplace to force him to speak to me. I even contemplated jumping off his block, while sitting on the stairs in between knocking on his door for him to speak to me.
Eventually he told me, please stop knocking on my door. I feel very stressed, it reminds me of times when the loanshark came to our house.
It took me more than a year, and a few months of severe pimple outbreak before I got over the heartbreak. I had pimple outbreak from excessively crying, it dried out my face or caused some hormonal changes and at age 25, I had my first outbreak.
My turning point came when I was overseas with a group of girl friends doing community work. After activities one day, they took us out fishing for lala in the river. It was evening time. As I floated lazily down the river, I looked up and suddenly saw that the sky was round. I can't put it in words, but the sky was so vast and clear.. clouds dotted the sky. I could see it was indeed round. And I thought to myself: The world is so big, there's still so many things I haven't seen and done, so many things waiting for me..
In that moment, I was filled with hope and excitement for the future and stopped looking back on my past. It took another few months for my pimples to die down.. I discovered the vegetarian diet helped calm my hormones and pimples down.
My healing really came after this river trip. I started doing alot of things on my own, like cycling from ECP to Changi Point or Barrage every weekend. Going to swim 20 laps. All on my own. It was very empowering because I had never been a very independent person.
And then about a year after the break up, my colleagues encouraged me to start dating again. They told me about online dating. Actually my director was the one who told me about it. That's where he met his wife. So I did, and then I met my future husband. We dated for 2 years and have been married for 5 years now.
Anyway, I am just writing to put this on the internet, and putting it out there that I hope this first guy is well and found someone he deserves. I hope things have gone better for him and his family and I sincerely wish them the very best. I keep him in my thoughts quite frequently, like once every few months I would wonder if he's ok.
I mean, after all he has been through, I hope god is treating him better now.
Oh, actually we did meet about 2 years after the breakup. Purely by coincidence. My grandma had been warded in hospital and so was his dad. My cousins bumped into him and told him about grandma, who he also knew. So he messaged me after that to ask her condition. That's the first time we spoke after so long, I was already dating my husband. Anyway long story short, his dad passed away from kidney failure shortly after and I also visited his funeral. I felt really guilty at that time because I had blamed our breakup on his dad too. Anyway that was the last time we spoke.
End of story, it was long.

56079,96901,"*apologise for any error or typo, and mentioning of race to try explain the story, and it might be complicated*
I was at Bishan Junction 8 pet lover's today, 15/04/2021 at 7:28pm. My friend and I went into the store to get some hamster treats. When i first went into the the store, there was already a chinese lady who was with her son talking to 2 of the staff working there. There was also another indian lady at the payment counter. My friend and i didnt think much, we were just looking at the pets and then we started hearing this lady shouting. The chinese lady turned out to be a freaking KAREN LOL.
KAREN kept shouting at the staff and shouted things like-
""I'm very disappointed in you""
""You will have to pay for it, you're responsible""
""I will complain about you""
""We are very sincere YOU KNOW""
"" I CALLED YOU AT 12PM TO TELL YOU WE WILL BE COMING DOWN TONIGHT""
""THEY HAVE PIANO LESSONS YOU KNOW""
( referring to her son and her daughter who was with her husband which both of them were not there at that point of time )
"" DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TAKES TO COME HERE FROM EAST COAST???1111?1!11?1?1?1?11!!""
"" DONT SAY SORRY TO ME SAY SORRY TO HIM""
"" THEY CAME HERE WITHOUT EATING DINNER YOU KNOW?!?!??????!?""
THIS karen was shouting and saying that she came in yesterday but because the store was closing, they couldnt make up their mind if they want this freaking rabbit, so they said they will come back today.
I didn't get the any of the staff's name but the staff who talked to this KAREN on the phone told her the Pet lover's policy is that they are not allowed to reserve pets just by using words over the phone( they said the call was made at about 12pm ). common sense ?? no ?? no guarantee no nothing, just words? The indian lady also called up the store to give them a heads up, the staff also said that she also told the indian lady the same
policy and there is also another customer who is interested in getting the rabbit.
The Indian lady was there first and already bought the necessities for her new pet rabbit, like cage and whatever not. When she paid for everything, Karen went into the stall and found out that the rabbit was already sold. KAREN was obviously unhappy and started shouting those things above. She also raised her voiced at the staff asking
"" WHO IS IT ?!? WHO YOU SELL IT TO ?!? ""
and the staff pointed to the indian lady beside her son LOL this KAREN dare not shout at the Indian lady so she took it out on the poor staff ????
The staff again, tried explain to KAREN why the rabbit was sold, and kept apologising. KAREN BEING KAREN obviously shouted even louder and louder infront of her son. So Karen called her husband down LOLOL typical Karen move.
JUST SAYING, the husband did nothing at all and he kept quiet the whole entire time. So the more Karen couldnt get the cute rabbit, she kept asking her husband to do something about it.
So KAREN and family was blocking the entrance, the staff who was being shouted at started tearing up but quickly wiped away her tears and went out behind them to welcome other customers in. Karen wasnt done so she stepped back and continue barking at the staff. The second staff went to call the supervisor and tried explaining the situation but also broke down. The supervisor told the staff to call security and then security came down.
When 2 of the security came down, they asked the safe entry staff ( because he was the one who called them ) what happened and he just pointed to all of us. I pointed at KAREN. When Karen saw the 2 security officer, she asked them 'What's the problem?? can you solve this for us? no? I'm dealing this with her!1!1?!?!?1!1!"" and the staff didnt want to trouble them so she told them it's ok. So basically the security guards just stood beside Karen's family and did nothing but kept quiet the entire time LOL thanks
The staff apologised again and said that she understand that she's very angry and it's her fault. but KAREN pointed to her children and told the staff - ""DONT SAY SORRY TO ME!1!1!1!11!!11!!!!!!! SAY SORRY TO THEM""
The staff didnt hesitate a single bit and step forward and apologised to KAREN DNA kids. LMAO the entire time when KAREN was inside the store with her son, he was just staring into blank space. Suddenly he 'cried' when the staff apologised and went behind KAREN. At this point, I told my friend about it and he stepped forward. He told KAREN to not raise her voice and to not shout anymore because there were many passerby who stopped and stare. It must have been really embarrassing for the staff what??? Karen not happy so she told my friend -
""Keep quiet, I'm having a conversation with her""
My friend fired back saying, "" No you're not, you're shouting at her and she dont have to deal with your attitude"" KAREN'S PRIDE MUST HAVE BEEN HURT at this point, and she asked my friend "" WHAT ATTITUDE?!1?1?1! ""
My friend then told the staff-
""just go in, you dont have to deal with her attitude""
He then looked at Karen and told her
"" if you're unhappy, you can just call the police.""
Then at Karen's husband
"" Please control your wife ""
KAREN'S HUSBAND kept tapping her arm said let's go. NO USE LORRRR.
AND SHE OBV DIDNT CALL the police la cause she knew she was out of line
I pulled the staff back into the store and she kept telling me she was okay and it was her fault. Then i told KAREN she was abusing the staff, she's so crazy in the head she can ask me how is she doing that. HER daughter who is about like p3/4, said to me "" but we already called about the rabbit "" lmao and i answered, didnt the staff already tell
you about their policy ???
I told her she have been shouting and raising her voice for 30minutes.
"" ARE YOU SURE 30MINS ?!??!?!?! ""
"" urm yes ???? ""
and then she kept quiet LOL and then she ask me to SHUT UP
so i was already very frustrated at how self entitled she is, i shouted back at her.
i told her to stfu and shes a f*cking b*tch, i know it was unnecessary but she really went out of line by shouting at the staff NON STOP. demoralising the staff by saying she's irresponsible and unreasonable. telling the staff she will pay for it
blah blah nonsense ????? this my first every time witnessing a karen. SHOUTING and fighting over a freaking rabbit. Then her daughter suddenly went from like omg we called about the rabbit to ma im sorry we dont want the rabbit anymore.
One of the secuirty uncle looked at me and signaled me to keep quiet and not say anything. LOL OK THANK YOU COMING DOWN you can go back up and secure this mall. please restrict all karens next time thank you ????
SO karen gave up after she was being fired back at
and started walking away and mubling to herself.
HOW is she not embarrassed for acting so rowdy and disgusting in public over a freaking rabbit???? Even when the staff cried infront of her, she have no freaking remorse or whatsoever LOL
I hope pet lover's do not believe the shit this KAREN says LMAO

The moment this happens, their ig accounts immediately evolve into major cringe fests splattered with motivational quotes, “I’m hustling to help my clients not for the money”, “I’m all about sharing knowledge”, xx achiever for the month and thank you to my entire ancestry line. Firstly let’s be real, you are there for the money so just own it. Next, just to clarify I really respect some friends who are working in this industry because it really is hard work. However, some people really make me sick because I’ve seen how they were like back in school. They were some of the most irresponsible and lazy people around who can’t even be punctual for important things, yet now they are suddenly the most responsible hustler trying to sell you an expensive insurance package or a house. Erm seriously, even if I were desperate, I probably wouldn’t trust you with my money given how two face you are.

When my parents asked me when is the graduation ceremony and whether or not they can go for it...i told them soon. Deep down in my heart i felt like i should have told them that it became a virtual ceremony because of COVID.
I knew they will be happy if they see me on stage although its just a ceremony because is something to be happy for them as we come from a low income family. I started working since i was 14 to work for my own allowances and pay for school fees. Its really a long journey for me and i know my parents know that i work really hard too.
Anyway, i just wanna say Pa, Ma. I made it. Will definitely provide you a better life for your retirement. To all the graduates out there, Happy Graduation.

55839,96284,"Dear #96104 &#96224
I was in a 10 year relationship with someone whom my parents didnt approve of. I literally grew up with this person on my side all the time but he was just like ur ex - he felt that there was no way he was going to convince my parents.
He told me directly, "" if you want to get married to me, find a way to leave your house.""
When my parents first found out about us, they went mad. They said no way and that i will suffer if i marry him. But i was adamant. I was determined that this was not going to change my decision and didn't speak to my family members. We constantly fought each time they found out i was out him.
In the beginning, i tried to ignore the bigger problem. I told myself that when the time is right everything will fall in place. But it does not.
Like your ex, he had issues with his job, he was not responsible and it was me who started earning a steady income while he was busy job hopping n clubbing. I didnt mind paying for everything because i loved him.
But reality hit me. My friends who were together for 2-3 years had plans to BTO, they were planning their lives ahead. But i was still handling this person and helping him steady his life.
He made it look like we weren't planning anything 'cos my parents didnt approve.'
Worse, he wouldn't want to talk to my parents or get his parents over to mitigate the issue. I often asked him about just making things formal so that it wouldn't be that awkward for us in future. But he said nope. He said his ego was much bigger and no way he 'was going to step into my parent's home'.
Long story short, i decided one day to end the relationship based ENTIRELY on his decision not to come over n speak to my parents. It said a lot about how much he was willing to show he loved me.
I was not asking for money or vacations or expensive rings.
Just to be on my side to tell my parents together that we got it all settled and to assure them. But he said no.
This was not about my parents, but it was about me. About us. It also hit me that he was not confident because my parents were not wrong about his behaviour and irresponsibility.
It took me a long time to get over the decade. But trust me, looking back, i am so glad i didnt choose to stay with someone who valued his ego over our relationship. It hurt like mad, but time definitely heals.
PLEASE BELIEVE THAT LIFE MOVES ON. Good luck!

I only causally mentioned I had been downgraded my pes status.
She then asked if I was an officer
I told her no
She then asked ,so you're a Sargent?
I remember my exact reply ""no just a regular man""
She then said ""you have no drive that's why""
I can't date you liao ,""you not an officer and you not fit""
She added I wasn't from a good family that's why I can't be an officer.
She then revealed to me she had dated a guy who was an"" air force pilot "" during NS
I didn't reply cause I know that is totally not possible .
I shook her hand and wished her good luck
That night she sent me one long text reminding me of my ""lack of drive "" me not being fit and not being an officer and not being good in uni and not ""hustling "" to earn $$
It's been 7 years since this happened . I still laugh about this and feel super blessed.
I own my own SME now ,and turns out her husband (the same guy) has applied for a job but hid CV says

And he's only got a 2nd upper .
I didn't hire him ,I refered him to some other of my business associates firms because am not spiteful at all.

We have nice conversations and sometimes we laugh together. But, I see no future in us. I think I am more into the more muscular type of guys and at least drive. But last week, he did something totally unexpected. omg. You know the durian season is here and the people here are all nuts for this. He suggested we buy some durians and eat at my place. He then chose some durians himself. omg. I never knew he has these skills. He declined the opening of the fruit and insisted to open the fruit at home. woah. once at home, he displayed his opening and cutting skills. You know the part where you needed to bend and push the fruit lips apart to get the seeds? omg, he did with such strength. I admit, I was a bit wet and turned on. omg, such hidden skills. what should I do now?

57195,100008,"My boyfriend is really really smart. He is a mechanical engineer and he's already earning 5 digits in his 20s. He told me that his mum forced him to take the mensa IQ test and he actually scored 155 when he was 20. However sometimes it really frustrates me when he uses his logic against me. What would you do if you were me?
Examples:
When I asked for a valentine's date at the USS, he told me to go there some other time because of the crowd. His reason is that Valentine's Day is a ""corporate trick"" to make us spend more on things we don't need and that day doesn't have any significance.
When I asked him what ring he is going to buy for me when we get married, he started talking about how the price of diamonds is artificially inflated through a monopoly and started talking about the history of marketing of diamonds.
When I asked him when he wants to get married, he said that marriage is a social construct (?!?!) and that we should get married only when we feel stable enough to BTO.

55128,94497,"I cheated.
After entering my new work place for 6 months, I could hit it off really well with my colleague girl A and we started hanging out even after work. I was selfish, I wanted the best of both worlds, I didn't tell her that I am currently attached. We started going on dates and I was cheating emotionally. I had to find ways to hide it from my current girlfriend. After 3 months when things are getting serious, I cheated physically. Day after day , my guilt is over consuming me, it wasn't fair for the both of them and I couldn't bring myself to tell either one the truth. My long time girlfriend thought that I'm always busy at work so that I couldn't meet her and she was very understanding, encouraging me along the way while in actual fact I was spending my day away at girl A's house.
Fast forward to last December when I couldn't take the guilt anymore and decided to end things with Girl A, she found out about my current relationship and threatened to expose it to my girlfriend. I didn't want my gf to find out from a third party so I told her myself.
She was completely broken. She went silent, she didn't ask me why, she didn't ask me what went wrong ,she didn't ask me anything. She just stared into space and sobbed silently. I promised her I will never do it again and seek forgiveness. I completely understand if she wish to leave me but she forgave me and she said she will be better for me.... I felt like shit. It wasn't even her.... the problem was me. She loved me with all her heart yet I took it for granted. She loved me so much that she blamed herself.
After this incident, we continued to live life together and explore new things but I knew things weren't the same. There are nights when I find her crying herself to sleep... I have ruined her perception of love and eroded the trust she has for me.....
Guys out there, before you succumb to the temptation of cheating please think twice. Don't end up like me making a bad decision and destroying your gf's life.

55192,94663,"I've been so sad with so many stories about girls pursuing materials in a relationship rather than core values of love & kindness. However I kinda understand their perspectives because I used to be in the same situation. So I decided to share my story when I dated an ultra millionaire for 4 years and broke up 3 years ago.
Alert: Pardon my loose writing or any grammar mistake because I was writing it at 3AM in the morning and really typing it out of my stream of emotions.
We knew each other from college (first year I think). Back then my family was so poor that we only lived paycheck by paycheck, and if I hadn't earned the scholarship we would have never been able to afford the tuition. There were times that my parents had to secretly skip their meals because they did not have enough money to buy food for the whole family, but they lied to us that they had to go on a diet for health purposes. Typing that story now made me cry....
My ex boyfriend, by contrast, came from a totally different world. His family is one of the biggest tycoons in his country and has lots of businesses (retail, real estate) across SEA. Growing up, he never has the concept that people can be so poor that they cannot buy everything they want, and he can't understand why my parents were so poor, why I did not have money to buy my own clothes and always wore the give-away stuffs from neighbors/relatives, or why I had to send money back home to support my family when I started working.
I did not know his background when we first dated, and that was the best time of our relationship because the love was so pure & full of love, respect, and optimism. I remember on our first date, I bought him a KFC ice cream then we sat on the street and talked about our dreams for hours. He was so kind and gentle, did not care about materialistic stuffs at all, only wore an Uniqlo tshirt, flip flop and never talked about how rich he was.
Then things changed when he started to hang out with a new groups of friends from his class, who would casually buy a Rolex on a Saturday morning because they were just bored or when someone gave them the Angbao with full of cash (to indirectly bribe their parents). I guess when they spent hours per week only talking about how much money people have, how to spend money, or how to define themselves with money, he would inevitably change.
And then he started to shower me with money. He took me to Europe, US, flying on business class, dining at all Michelin-starred restaurants. He bought me luxury bags, clothes, shoes, and everything he thinks a girl should need to show her class so that I can be comparable to his friends' girlfriends (silly, IKR). He even paid half of my tuition and literally financed me for 2 years before I graduated from uni. At that time I felt so good because (1) I removed the financial burden of my family and (2) Luxury does taste good at first. When I looked back, I was always grateful for what he did. Without him, I couldn't finish my bachelor, explore the world at such a young age, and develop my cultured self & sophisticated taste later on in life.
Things were getting bitter after we graduated and had to face real life problems and face our huge differences in life values. Firstly: friends. I never enjoyed meeting his friends. Those convos were always about who got a new watch or who had more expensive houses. And they clearly looked down on me because of my background. He did not like my friends either, because to him, if they're poor and did not bring any networking value or business opportunity hence my time with them was a waste. He said we should not care about emotional support from friends, that's nonsense...
Second difference: family value. All of his friends and their parents publicly cheated but their partners cannot have a say because they're financially dependent and well, he said, that's pretty normal. Having a mistress is a badge of honor in that circle, whoever got a hotter/more famous mistress would have a higher score... I was like WTF how can you agree with that, then he said well it's the privilege of being rich: you can buy whatever you want, be it a marriage or a mistress and using money to control people is the best feeling. He said don't worry he still loved me the most and would never cheat on me, he did not care about other prettier girls but who knows...During our last six months together, I could tell that he no longer listened to me when I was sad or got problems at work, we did not have meaningful conversations anymore, when we met he only needed the sex and then we headed out to 5-stars dinners or went shopping for luxury items. At that point I refused to take those gifts and offered to share the meals. :)
I guess I did not need to say no more...it's enough already to explain why I broke up with him. Though I was still poor AF at that time, and leaving the comfortable life was not an easy option. But deep inside me, I respected myself so much that I could not stand being in that life where I got no emotional support, no love, no respect from his friends & family. I could not stand being with someone who only cared about money and can only give me money. It was such a sad life.
I was depressed for 2 years after I broke up, because I was always feeling that I'm not enough. Even now, I'm earning 200K/year and can afford to buy my own Rolex (but I don't buy it cuz I don't like it), inside me there was a voice screaming that I'm nothing compared to him, I'm so ugly compared to his friends' mistresses, etc. I know it is such a toxic thought to feed my soul, but the trauma is really deeply ingrained... I have to see a therapist to work on this problem.
So girls, it's nothing wrong to dream of a rich boyfriend but always remember there are always 2 sides of the story. If you date a man only because of money, you'll end up having nothing other than money. That means you will not have anyone pampering you with monogamous love, care, and respect on lonely nights. If you date a rich man and you're not wealthy to the same level, all of their circles will think less of you. It's really hard to live in that world, at least for me.
Now I'm having a much happier and healthier relationship with a guy who currently earns less than me, but income is not a problem to me cuz he has such a wonderful personality that I look up to (I was simply lucky when I got the offer, I even felt I did not deserve that job.... ) His family is pretty well off but he built his career on his own without spending a penny of his parents' fortunes. He did not wear luxury outfits though his parents bought him a lot, because he did not feel comfortable with the fancy style. Before dating me, he mostly ate every meal at hawkers but always took me to nice places on our date nights. He heard about my family issues and never judged, and even love me more cuz he said I've been so brave to overcome many challenges to become who I am today. His family and friends love me, and they all value love & relationships over money.
And my last piece of advice: Never judge a man by his current earnings cuz career path and income are never in linear progressions. They can go up and down, as long as your partners always find ways to hone in their capabilities, money will never be a problem. Look at their ambitions, behaviours, and daily habits. Are they working hard, constantly learning and improving their skills? Are they humble and respect others' different point of views? Are they loving, kind, positive about others? Are they selfish or always helping others? Do your friends and family love them?
Believe me, those people will move mountains to make you happy with everything they have :)

56111,96949,"The idea that our children have a responsibility to care for us parents in our old age is selfish, it is unreasonable, it is backward, and it borders on slavery so much that I cannot believe that we continue to push this aspect of our tradition and culture into the mainstream, among the plethora of other irrational practices that we do in the name of tradition alone.
I just had a kid. She’s 2. I CHOSE to have her. She didn’t get to decide whether to come into existence. I chose that FOR HER. I will also choose a bunch of other things in her life that will in no small part determine whether she will lead a comfortable life, or one filled with suffering. I would like to think that I have a responsibility to care for her to the best of my abilities, because, and I reiterate, I CHOSE TO HAVE HER.
That being said, I do not expect her to give me anything in return. I brought her into this world FOR MY BENEFIT, and on my own volition. I would not even hide the fact that I wanted to have her for the very selfish reason that it would make me happy. People don’t go around doing things if they don’t make them happy. Even if we do things for other people, we do it because their happiness make us happy. So fundamentally, every decision is a selfish decision. Thus, we have to take FULL responsibility for every decision we make, and we should not expect another human to be indebted to us for circumstances in which they did not have a say.
Say I adopt a few African kids. Say I also own a cotton farm. Say I feed them, house them, and also teach them to harvest cotton. Does it really make sense that because of this concept called filial piety, these African children should grow up to be indebted to me forever? Does it make sense that even if they work on a different cotton farm one day, and God forbid they be paid a living wage, I should reserve the right to tax a portion of that income, because I CHOSE to adopt them when they were kids?
Think about it. And while you’re at it, also think about the various other aspects of your culture that is either unscientific, logically inconsistent, and unethical. We in Singapore like to think that we’re educated and progressive but as LKY said, first-world country, third-world mentality.

OP of #97067 here
Well Saturday was a hectic day for me
My mother found out about the ROM, cause the dressmakers ,called me and my mom picked up...
She confronted me about it ,so I quickly texted my fiancé.
He came down and then again asked my mother for my hand in marriage,
he asked my parents before only my dad said yes...
He tired to convince her ,but to no avail
She instead flew into rage and went on about how its not a good pairing and began citing religious reasons ..
To let her clam down my father ,and my fiancé and I left the house to go eat lunch
Where we planned on what to do next... plan was to lie that I was pregnant
Forward to today, Sunday...
My mother forced me to go to chruch with her
So she and my old cell group began to tell me how bad of an idea it would be.... citing verses and other reasons they came up with .
I left halfway through this ,and just said ""well guys its my life ""
I cried as the a person I cared about went to this exent to break my relationship
I went home and my dad and I began to pack my stuff ,mum came back and saw all my stuff packed about 70%
I told her i was leaving ,my fiancé came and once again sought her permission and her blessings
She said no ...
My dad then told her in Chinese ""we are going to have a grandchild soon ""
This shocked my mother and then she said we are lying etc
I showed her a generic ultrasound picture ,that I got my gyane to friend send me
And she was even more shocked she began shouting and then hit my stomach while saying ""its impossible "".......
My ahma then began to scold her ,never seen my ahma like that but she was the most pissed
My dad basically held mum down ...
I then went to my fiancé s home with most of my stuff
Just few hours ago my dad and ahma and sister came
They gave us thier blessings and my ahma and dad told him and I
""We are all family now ""
My future MIL gifted me the traditional punjabi wedding dress ,my father was gifted a turban form my future father in law for our ,private wedding that we are having after ROM in a few days time .
We had a late dinner ...
But I am sad
Have I lost my mother....?
I am happy and hurt at the same time

54801,93699,"A few years ago, I graduated from engin with a really low CAP and a poor resume. After about a year of job search, I ended up with a starting salary of 2.5k. Most of my friends were earning at least a thousand dollars more than me and I was extremely demoralised.
But being a guy with not many commitments (parents are self-sufficient and I never had a gf), I saved a lot of money. The covid lockdown earlier this year got me quite frustrated and impulsive and I decided to put in 50k into the stock market. Before this, I didn't know anything about financial literacy but learning about stocks and options changed my life. The USA stock market this year has been amazing.
Today, I decided that I am done and I cashed out everything. I have about 3 million dollars now. I am richer than most of my friends with their high flyer jobs. I still have my simple engineering job and no one knows how much money I am sitting on. When the pandemic is over, I will move to another country, do my masters and start a new life doing what I enjoy.
Moral of my story: Don't worry about your starting pay. Be smart, learn financial literacy, find your passion.
To those that are gonna comment that I am flexing, yes I am. But since I dont want to flex to friends, I find pleasure in flexing to you strangers on the internet

As I was getting my Cai Fan at UTown Finefoods, the uncle called out the cumulative cost as I called out each dish order. I think he should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

56661,98550,"27y/o single female, working since graduation (2017). Zero investing knowledge... attempting to learn. Since I've been saving all my money in my bank, currently have about $95000. I have life and health insurance.
Take home pay: ~$3500/month
Monthly expenses: $600 (self) + $600 (to parents)=$1200/month
Does it make sense to allocate the rest of my salary:
80% stocks 20%bond
For the stocks portion:
$500- S&P500 (US MARKET)
$500- VXUS (INTERNATIONAL MARKET)
$800- NIKKO ATM STI (SG MARKET)
I'm considering topping up CPF SA (about $500/month) as the bond portion for tax relief.
I chose ETF for the stocks portion as they are well-diversified and I'm not familiar with how to pick individual stocks. My concern is that there are taxes (30%?) associated with investing in USD... does it make better sense to stick to SG market?
Also, I am unsure what is the best platform to use for these transactions. Currently using online broker (moo moo/tiger) for S&P500 and VXUS, and OCBC BCIP for the Nikko ATM STI. I'm concerned if online broker is safe and cost-effective in the longterm.
Finally, am I allocating too much of my budget to investment? Should I continue to save money in the bank for my short-term goals (next 8-10years) (house, car, etc).
Please pardon my noob questions. I'm reluctant to talk with financial advisors as I always feel like they are trying to sell me their products... hence I turned to this platform. Hopefully I can get some good insight, which I'll take with a pinch of salt of course. Thank you very much sharing your views!

56109,96945,"Is it ever acceptable for a married person to insist on a divorce even though his/her spouse has done nothing wrong?
My mom has recently suggested that she wants a divorce with my dad even though my dad is possibly the most responsible and faithful father and husband in the world.
Since they've been married 25 years ago, my father has surrendered all income to my mom and received a small allowance every month. He is a freelance consultant and he earns close to $1500 every DAY, but my mom only gives him $3000 a month. Any more and he would have to ask for it. My mom deals with all the finances at home. The condo is paid off, a gift from my grandfather on my dad's side.
My dad does all the cleaning at home, he washes up after every meal (even though my mom always cooks), he does the laundry, and he does all the repairs and maintenance. My mom calls herself a ""housewife"" but honestly, my dad has been more of a ""housewife"" for the 25 years I have been alive.
My dad doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, he works his ass off for the family, and he also buys her presents/dinner EVERY SINGLE year on her birthday, on their marriage anniversary, and on the anniversary of the first time they met. He spares no expense, DESPITE the fact that he only has $3000 a month to spend. My mom, on the other hand, never remembers. She even had the audacity to say to me, after I asked her why she never once bought anything or even wrote a nice letter to my dad on his birthday, that ""[she] cooks for him every day."" I am speechless.
But let's just set that all aside and let's discuss the institution of marriage for a moment.
When we marry someone, we promise to be with them for the rest of our lives. It's a commitment, it's a contract. If anyone ever doubts that they will be able to make the commitment of time, then they should never have agreed to enter into that contract in the first place.
My mom is suggesting a divorce because she feels, and I quote, she doesn't love my dad anymore. The whole framework of my dad was destroyed, and he still continues to work. I have not spoken to her for 6 months after I heard her say that to my face, and I will probably not speak to her for the rest of my life.
Please respect the institution of marriage. When you're married to someone, unless he/she is unfaithful, or does anything illegal, please, don't mess around.

56666,98562,"Hi! This is not a rant, but I just wanted to anonymously say thank you to many Singaporeans who have been very kind to me. I recently became a Grab deliverer, and because I am still new and still learning the ropes, there have been one or two instances of spillage or delayed delivery. But the customers have been very kind and said it is ok, although I felt very bad and kept apologizing. I really want to thank them for being so patient with me.
Also, because I am a relatively petite female, a lot of merchant staff have been very encouraging and very helpful in making sure that I can handle the load, I am getting the right order, etc.
These are trying times, but your smiles and kindness have made it so much better. Thank you Singapore:)
