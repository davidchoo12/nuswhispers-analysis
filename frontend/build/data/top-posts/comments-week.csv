For example, if you are a hiring manager at an aviation MRO company, will you recognise the experience of an applicant who served as an engineer in the Air Force or with the likes of DSTA in his/ her previous job?
Or conversely will an experience in the public or civil service or uniformed service be a demerit point to hire that candidate, knowing that his/ her experience are not exactly ""real world"" profit making experience.

I feel you deserve to know what's going on behind the scenes. 
When I first started out my stint in NUS handling leasing, I actually found joy in the role. Our management back then had the community's welfare as a priority. We had meetings to discuss how to bring in a wider tenant mix to cater to growing demands, and also how to support existing tenants to better serve NUS (though some are a total b****!!).
Some years back, major changes happened to the management. Almost instantly, we had to become a profit center. In other words, our department's KPI was to make more money by bringing in tenants who could deliver higher returns.
Isn't this what all landlords are doing? Yes and No. All landlords (i.e. my big bosses) want to maximise earnings - that's just the reality. But when I joined NUS, our team genuinely believed in putting community first. We bring in variety and manage prices on our campuses. I actually spoke the new VP about how his change will impact our students, but it turned out to be like the saying - putting my warm face on a cold ass. Pui!
Over the years, I've been feeling jaded about it. It's not just NUS, my next job is not any better. Finding from my ex-colleagues who are still around in NUS, most tenants now are chains who can pay higher rates and pay higher GTO. They're also finding it harder to get them to comply to NUS policies simply because ""that's how their procedures are"". Too bad, policy change, now KPI depends on this.
I do miss the old days. I did have a good time working in NUS under my old boss, when we felt that what we were doing was meaningful.
