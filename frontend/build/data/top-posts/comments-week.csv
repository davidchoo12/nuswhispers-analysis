60259,106402,"I feel depressed because I was rejected by a girl on a personal level, most likely due to my financial background.
So I’m a guy, fresh into uni and new to relationships. Last semester I somehow get the courage to ask out this girl in the same year as me. Long story short, we hit off very well. We met up 5 times over a month, most times for an activity and not just a meal. On the 6th meeting, I sense the vibe is strong and I confess my feelings for her.
Up to this point I’m 100% confident she likes me back. But then to my utter surprise and horror, she says, “let’s just be friends, I’m not really into dating.”
I’m taken aback and I ask her why. She is surprisingly amiable and she takes some time to explain that it’s nothing to do with me but her, that she’s ‘just not into dating’ and doesn’t feel the need to get into a relationship. She also claimed that she honestly thought all those outings were just as friends and she didn’t know they were intended to be dates and apologised if she sent the wrong signals.
Regarding the “I just don’t want to date” line, I’ve heard countless times before that such rejections are actually personal. On NUSWhispers and also among my friends, there’s this saying: When a girl says she doesn’t want to date at all, she’s just trying to let you down easy, but actually she just doesn’t want to date YOU personally.
It's basically common knowledge.
Knowing the rejection was personal was so depressing. I suffered a mental breakdown over the next few days. It hurt like hell and got me agonising over what part of me is so bad. Some part of me must be so repulsive that I would get rejected on a personal level, especially with that cliché excuse of “I’m just not looking to date”. This excuse that covered up an unknown reason pained me to know that I had some personal problem that was so severe the girl must have deemed too hurtful to say out.
I agonised over why she didn’t like me. I narrowed it down to the 3 main common reasons: looks, education level, or financial status.
Now I know there could be other reasons, such as not feeling a romantic connection, incompatibility or mismatched personalities, which are completely possible and valid reasons for rejection, but I don’t think that’s the case here, otherwise the girl could have just told me she felt we didn’t click / were not compatible / I'm not her type; and such reasons are good and not hurtful at all. Furthermore we went out so frequently. Since she used the “just not into dating at all” excuse, she’s most likely lying to hide a deeper reason, and is trying to be nice because the real reason could be too hurtful for me to bear. So I think the reason is unlikely to be incompatibility or mismatched personalities, not least also because we shared a lot of similar hobbies like painting, music, etc. to name a few.
So such a hurtful reason has to be either looks, education level or financial status (I can’t think of any other reason too hurtful to say out).
I agonised for weeks after that, wondering what was wrong with me. It sure as hell cannot be education level as we were in the same year and taking the exact same course, down to the same minor. We both said we were aiming to continue doing a masters after our degree. As for looks... it’s very unlikely to be my looks as we went out multiple times. Also my friends all agree she was within my league in the looks department. And she was shorter than me.
So, that just left financial status.
As full time students who are not earning a steady income of our own yet, I once thought financial background didn’t matter much as long as I was still decently dressed and able to pay for dates. After all, we were in the same course, and it should be our future prospects that mattered more, right? Apparently, not in this case. I got the feeling she’s from a richer background than me and she probably realised it too. Because through our conversations, I found out she attended an expensive private high school, lives in the central area of a major city (she is a foreign student btw), and travelled to more Western countries than me. Doesn’t take a genius to figure out who is from a more well-off background. To clarify, I’m definitely not poor, I’m middle class. I don’t have student loans and both my parents work decent white collar jobs, but my background is definitely not as wealthy as hers.
And I’m pretty sure she knows I’m middle class because she asked what my parents were working as, and also asked what countries I’ve been to. And yes, I also paid for some of the ‘dates’ at decent eateries. But perhaps her financial standards were just too high.
Now I’m not saying that girls are gold diggers, but I heard that even in todays day and age, well-off women with their own money still want to date guys of equal or higher financial background compared to them, not because they are gold diggers and want the guy’s money, but simply because a higher financial status makes one look more successful and attractive overall.
So yeah, the girl most likely lied that she’s just not into dating to hide the hurtful truth of what she truly felt, that she thought my financial status was too low for her. Furthermore she is a foreign student from a country whose citizens have a reputation for being highly materialistic and judging others based on financial background. Deride me all you want for stereotyping or generalising, but like I mentioned earlier, rejection based on financial background seems most plausible. Furthermore, I have friends from that particular country who always specified that whenever girls from their country say “its not personal, I just don’t want to date in general”, the rejection is in fact personal and the other party is bullshitting.
So yeah, it has to be financial status. The only reason that is both personal and too hurtful to say out. Either that or there’s something else so repulsive about me that I’m hit with that cliche excuse.
And now I'm hurt like shit. Especially because of that girl's excuse.
Even if you don't agree with my assessment on it having been due to financial background, you can't deny that the rejection was personal towards me, and some part of me must have been so repulsive to the point she would use that 'not into dating at all' excuse. Either way, the rejection sure was personal. And the reason hurtful and terrible enough for the girl to use that cliche excuse.
So this happened months ago, but I still feel pained by it. Sucks to be rejected on a personal level, and judged for your financial background. My self esteem has been shattered and I am depressed. Trying to get this off my chest before the next semester…

60264,106415,"I’m a guy who was led on by a girl… mildly infuriating.
Firstly, my story.
So one day in class I saw this girl I liked and asked her out to lunch. She said yes. We had lunch at a nice restaurant in a shopping mall, where I paid. From then on, we got along very well, we frequently met up, and chatted very well, all over the period of a month. By ‘well’, I mean ALL our meet-ups were one-to-one, we took turns treating each other to lunches, and we texted each other for hours on end, sometimes late into the night.
I was interested in her, and I also thought she was interested in me.
Then one fine day I confess my feelings for her. She looks genuinely shocked (and I’m shocked at her reaction too), then she says “I’m sorry, I already have a boyfriend, I thought we were just friends…”
By the way we have a mutual friend whom I’ve known for some time. But I only met the girl a month ago, so she wasn’t my friend prior to me asking her out. It was pure coincidence that my friend happened to know the girl quite well.
Later I found out from this friend that she already had a bf LONG before she met me, and she only saw me as a good friend from the very start. This friend also told me that she felt bad if she gave me the wrong impressions and was truly just trying to make new friends in the course, and wasn’t some stupid reason like trying to make her bf jealous.
The mutual friend is someone I know for some time and trust. So, if she truly is a nice person and wasn’t trying to make her bf jealous or what, I think she led me on because she was either lonely or something.
Now, my rant.
This has left me feeling kinda infuriated. I feel like I’ve wasted emotions. I invested some degree of emotions into this only to get heartbroken. Like, girls, ASSUMING you aren’t doing morally questionable things like gold-digging or making your bf jealous, you don’t agree to lunch at a RESTAURANT, with a NEW guy one-to-one, AND let him pay, AND to top it all off CONTINUE to meet up with him in a similar fashion, UNLESS you are interested in him as more than a friend, right? It’s just not normal! If you were interested in a new guy at first but later lost interest, then fair enough, but this girl already had a bf and wasn’t interested as more than a friend from the start. So it was really unfair for her to agree to go out one-to-one with me more than once, when she was never interested, as that would give me the wrong idea that she’s interested when she never was.
Sharing this partly as an appeal for all not to lead others on. It’s just not right.

60273,106443,"Disclaimer: rant ahead.
I graduated a year ago and have a full time job earning about 4k/mth. I've been working since uni to support myself and hardly asked my family for money. But since I started working, my family asked me for about 1.2k/mth as allowance. It's not that I can't spare the cash since I'm quite frugal but I'm just tired of how they will remind/ chase me for the money if I'm late. I don't know what's their obsession with the money. When I bring up my financial situation, they will say they also don't have money and that I should just give. In the end, I'll just pay to avoid the arguments and drama. This is too exhausting.
Thanks for listening to the rant.

60255,106392,"TLDR: My chinese parents disapproves of my interracial marriage with my indian (local) fiance even though he was already significantly well-to-do. What else can I do?
Met my fiance back during internship and he was my supervisor. We hit it off really easily as he was really friendly and gave me lots of guidance. He was very beta and defintely the kind of guy I am looking for. We continued keeping in contact after I graduated, and we eventually started dating.
Now, I've recently accepted his marriage proposal and we have met both side of parents. His indian parents were very accepting of me, but my chinese parents were very disapproving.
They had the impression that since I'm a relatively slim and good looking chinese girl, my beau should be similiar.
My fiance is fat, has a beer belly and was 10 years my senior (40 this year). But it's only 10, and he is relatively well-to-do, reporting directly to the c-suites at his company.
I don't really get what is wrong given that the world should have been more liberated to interracial relationships.
What else can I do to help my parents accept him?

60252,106385,"Depressing story time. You know how in school your teachers tell you that hard work is most important than intelligence? I used to believe that until I got into uni.
My PSLE 100+ almost went NT but got into NA stream. A lot of my classmates are typical pai kia, smoke in toilet, don’t go school and fake MC, have sex in school. I’m the more guai type, study hard, attend all my class but just shit at study. Maybe I stupid, idk, sometimes I see my other classmates sleep in class all day, never go school, never do homework but exam time results is same or better than me and it make me very angry, why I just cannot understand how to study?? My father kena fired that time, no money send me tuition but my teachers always offer help, give me extra tuition after school. My outside friends all also very help me, give me their school notes and past year exam papers. They all very smart, go atas school and express.
N level ok, O level not bad can go poly. At first want to challenge myself, purposely choose harder course. School alumni team even ask me go back talk to the NA NT tell them about my success into going poly.
Few months in results like shit again, lecturer also advice me maybe this course not my calling, not suited for my skills so change to easy course, close both eye also can pass that kind. Again study very hard, go to all my lecture always ask question and after school mug until last bus home then go home. Everyone told me I age a lot. My outside friends all also ask if I ok because I look like shit. No matter how hard I also pia because my family not rich, cannot afford change course then drop out, unlike my outside friends can go overseas do masters do this do that idw sound jealous but actually I quite jealous them.
Meet up with outside friends, all grad already, always talk about their work life, their job, marriage plan, BTO. I sit there like idiot because I 3 years behind everyone. They not purposely make me feel like shit, also give me a lot advice like do internship, do online course and build up CV all. Meanwhile I still over here studying like dog no time do internship or online course.
After mugging like shit for years, surprise surprise, average result. Fuck. 90% my course mate don’t even go lecture, always ask me and others help take attendance, but still results come back half of them better than me. Fuck. Really fuck, IQ 0 EQ also 0. Reaching 30 years old finally got 1 gf at 20+++ actually is I feel like I just anyhow settle for a gf because parents worried I gay or cannot get married so I shoot my shot with every girl. After that find out she also feel the same, just settle with me like I’m rebound because she just break up with her bf and want get back at him. We still in rs but sometimes feel like we just lonely together aiya that’s another story for another time.
Keep applying job, kena rejected by 99.999% company, only lanjiao insurance scammer give me call back. All the company tell me I no experience so cannot. Eventually bo bian settle for internship $800 a month while my outside friends working lawyer, doctor, banker all making 5-10 times more than me, probably even more.
How? Hard work? PUI! Hard work can put food on table? Can do well in school, get good job? Joke. I accepted already I just stupid. Think my big take away is the reason why is call “success story” because it almost never fucking happen.
Maybe make me better person? Can eat a lot of shit 吃苦大王 too bad in life king of eating shit get shit eating job and shit eating life.

i don't know if my gf has an anger mgmt issue, is schizo, bipolar or smthg else but wtv the case is, i just hope she can get better
normally she is super nice, very sweet, even thoughtful. but once in a while she transforms into someone i don't even recognize. i live in stress everyday for fear of her fiery temper and i have no idea when it will next strike.
she is also an avoidant. when she is angry she will disappear on me and even block me on social media with no warning. other times when she did not go so extreme she just goes on a few hours long screaming match at me while i can only listen.
the strange thing is she is normally a good person so it is not like she is like this everyday.
i love her a lot but it has already been two years and the situation has not improved. she is super touchy about the word mental health so it is impossible to suggest to her that smthg may not be quite right or she shld learn better habits. i have tried to talk to her about this when she is her normal self but she forgets all her promises the next time she gets pissed.
when she gets pissed she will also insult me and say a lot of things which are just not true. it is really hurtful and damaging. i am not sure if i should take these to heart and discuss the content of what she said each time? as they say no fire no smoke. roughly once a month she breaks up with me and we patch back again two days later all on her own accord.

60262,106407,"For the guys out there who have never been in a relationship or dating before, as a guy myself (25 yo, NUS alumni), I want to share on some important notes before you start dating or a relationship.
1) Actions from girls are more important than words. Yes, a girl may claim she misses you, text you good morning, say will bring you you to xxx, say will do xxx. If they are just saying without any actions done CONSISTENTLY, then it is just plainly talking.
2) Please don’t accept a relationship just because you are afraid to be alone or already in the so called “typical age range to get married” or most of your friends are attached. Rather to be alone than to be in a relationship/marriage suffering!!
Side track: according to book I read, the most important things in life for a guy are:
A) Health
B) Own savings
C) Family and Guy Besties (see girl is not in the list)
3) Watch out for her body language. If a girl CONSISTENTLY:
A) Keep her phone/phone screen away from you
B) Disallow you from using her phone
Explanation for A and B: she does that because she has something fishy to hide.
C) Never want to put your couple picture as her dp or post on social media or even discourage you to do so. Delete your couple photos on her phone.
Explanation for C: She considers herself to be in the “spinster” market. Means she is still looking around for her partner or even scared of people seeing you two together.
D) Always talk about herself and rarely entertain you
Explanation for D: One sided. She only want companionship. There should be give and take.
E) Always online on WhatsApp/Telegram but take 10000 years to reply your messages
No need to explain you should know why.
F) Say “none of your business”.
This is a major red flag. In a relationship, you all are supposed to work and listen together, not one don’t care about the other.
G) Don’t know what she wants in a relationship. Even after months.
H) Flirting and Cheating. When someone flirted and cheated although she has you, it means that your relationship is not that strong enough to begin and typically she will not suddenly change her heart overnight. So please do yourself a favour to distance away from her. Why tolerate someone like that?
I) Always texting a lot of male friends. Go to male friends’ house alone and not with a group of people.
J) Not willing to fork out money for meals/trips on YOU. If a girl is cash stripped because of her family situation (eg. Take care of family/pay loan/debt), it is understandable. Otherwise, the typical girl will always have more than money to spend on you on meals. Imagine a girl having difficulties parting with her money at the dating stage/while in a relationship, and imagine if you were to have kids with her, she definitely want you to spilt/pay for the hospital bills and baby accessories expenses. Would you ever want that?
Side note: a typical girl will chat with more than one guy online/in person. Please keep your eyes open and don’t put 100% heart into the relationship unless you feel reciprocated. Otherwise you will get hurt.
4) I suggest men to watch videos from Andrew Tate YouTube Channel (yes I am a fan of him). From his channel, I learned that a girl who truly wants to be with you would put 100% effort and her heart to be with you. She will be willing to spend money and time with you. No excuses. No mind games. You will be her priority other than her job.
Thanks for reading up to here :). I have been in the above situations blindly until I woke up finally. It has been very heartbreaking for me since I put my 100% heart into it. I cried a lot and felt depressed and I am recovering from it now. At least I am thankful for recognising it at the start of the relationship.
iykyk ;)

60283,106462,"I grew up in a less than privileged background. I worked super hard, because my mother told me to. She told me that if I didnt work hard, she wouldn't pay for school. That it.
I slogged my ass off, raffles, then nus medicine. I just worked hard, listened to advice from my peers, and worked. I remember failing multiple times during this process, failing, and getting up, no tuition nothing. and before you think I am bragging, I am not, I am bitter. I am bitter because I had no help during those struggles, those struggles where I saw my friends going for tuition after their fun ccas so they could get someone to catch up with them, and then off for nice holidays after each tiring semester. meanwhile I went home to a crowded home with not much.
in university, my parents didnt even understand the course I was in. They said oh wow good ah doctor. But they didnt understand the stresses I was under, how my peers looked down on me for not being able to get that starbucks every week, or eat the same meal every day (""why you always eat the same thing lol"") no one said anything explicitly, but just people started hanging out with me less... and less.
Now I have a family, small but its mine. dont really have friends from school, just a few work ones who we get teh (coffee shop) together and its surprisingly the highlight of my week. I dont want to have kids because I dont want them to go through what I had gone through.
my mum, she was probably the driving force behind why i cant quit. I now acknowledge its my trying to live up to her expectations and make her proud that I did all of this. I never once dared to show her my failures, or my struggles, or my isolation. Because I was the son she was proud of, I was important in her eyes. and so I kept the path, never once considered seriously dropping out even though I had minimal interest in this medical path.
its 2am and I have just finished a shift. I hope that someone out there reads this and learns something from it. you wil inevitably be influenced by your parents/peers/society. this is something ive learnt that cannot be avoided. but what you can do is to be conscious of it, and to try bit by bit, to integrate a part of yourself in a sustainable way, a part of happiness in your life so that one day you can find peace in the struggle that is your job/career/course.
Have empathy for the peers who seem isolated and struggling, or even acted out in school. Dont write them off as introverts or whatever. They likely just have more to deal on their plates than you do, or you have more social/economic support than them to get through your shared circumstance. Maybe say hi, share notes, or reach out to them if you havent heard from them for a while and say hey, I see you, I know youre struggling, Im going through this with you (not in those exact words but like sometimes just company helps)
one last thing, I would also like to say thank you to that one senior in school who stood by me when things were tough and that it was very meaningful and prob was the reason for finishing the course.
I try to do that now with my juniors in the hospital. Anyway goodnight

60278,106453,"To 106443. On the giving parents 1.2k rant.
I have to do a submission in order to comment because my entire ""family"" is on my fb.
I have the same toxicity family as you. And mind you, giving money is the least of my worry. I still have to do entire household chores taking turns with my sister while my own dad is watching youtube and mom playing phone games.
When i was still under one roof with them it was nightmare every day. I had to bug my bf to hurry up marry me and get me out of there. I was very stupid for me to tell them my salary of 3.6k back then and i started buying them gifts. And the ball dropped on me when they wanted allowance of $500 because they saw how well to do I am. On top of that, i have to pay for my mom's shopping spree on lazada and taobao because ""i dont know how to do online payment"". I damn regretted teaching her and showing her the good deals available. It is really bad during the 11/11 whatever sales.
So here's the thing on how i escape from these sick ""parents"" who treated me as an investment.
I stayed more in my bf's house, saying that it was nearer to workplace. I eventually got married, got my bto, 2 kids. I told my parents that im not paying them anything other than cny angbao. I have my own life to handle, bills to pay myself and guess what i asked for money from them. They dodge me all the way.
I mean i heck care. They went to manipulate my relatives saying how useless am i. They even refuse to take care of my bb. Refuse to help in house reno. Whatever. I do it myself with my husband & his family. And i never regret this move ever since. Honestly its good riddance since they are out of my life and waiting for me to fail. But i show them success and happy without them.
To any boomers who are about to comment how unfilial am i, think again.
If my parents didnt demand harshly, i would have spent lavishly on them, bring them out on holidays, more family time spent. But they made the whole thing so sour, spoil my image to all the relatives and friends, refuse to help in my confinement, playing with my kids, i think this is what strike the balance. Force me until i simply dont care anymore.

60276,106448,"How do you live with regret?
I met her when we were in school. I was in my final year while she's a freshman. It was love at first sight. I pursued her furiously and we got together a few months later. She was the entire package and my ideal type of girl. But a few months later I lost interest and left her after I graduate. I admit it was entirely my fault and I broke her heart. I thought our interests would no longer align and I believed I would move on to focus on my career. I started to play the field as I decided I'm not ready to settle down yet. I have to say, she was still the best out of the others that I've met.
Fast forward a few years later. I met her on a flight on one of my business trip. I thought fate brought us together. We went out of a meal while overseas as we have some free time before I start my work. I can feel sparks flying the entire evening and I believed she felt the same way too. Everything was smooth until I asked her if she's seeing anyone. My heart sank when she said she's attached.
Nonetheless, I wished her well and we continued to keep in touch even after I've returned to sg. I couldn't get her out of my mind. I was actually casually seeing someone else but I quit it after meeting my ex. My ex doesn't post much on SM so I couldn't guess who's her bf.
Even though years past, she's still the perfect girl in my eyes. I've never met anyone who can make me laugh as much. I felt very protective of her. Her charisma, confidence, I looked up to her as she's someone who's very knowledgeable, supportive and caring too. Not only that, we come from the same background plus we still have common interests. I believed we are perfect for each other. I still enjoyed hearing from her after all this time. Who can forget their school sweetheart that easily? We continued to text each other like friends. I never thought to confess as I didn't think it was appropriate as she's attached and I also believed I can be happy for her as long as she's happy.
Imagine how elated I was when she suddenly asked me out one day and said she had news. I thought she was going to tell me she broke up with her bf or confess to me. I thought it was going to be a date.
I still remember how beautiful she looked. We talked as though time never left us. Talking to her was so easy. I never had to worry about what to say next. When we finished our meal then she told me the news.
Her bf proposed. She's engaged. And this will be the last time we see or speak to each other. She confessed she wanted to meet and tell me instead of texting because she wanted to see me for the last time. She also said she needed to let me go and apologised for being friends again. I was devastated. Not only am I losing her forever, I can't even be in her life anymore. I didn't know how to convince her I'm fine but I guess she already knew.
Eventually I found out her bf was actually someone we both know from school. So I guess that guy went after her after we broke up.
I felt so stupid for letting her go. My feelings for her were stronger than before as I thought she is the one. Some nights I wish I can turn back the time and not break up with her. I know I'm no saint. I still do casual dating. I end up comparing my dates to my ex and this frustrates me.
Probably that's why my ex never chose me again as I may have given her the impression I'm not serious to settle down. Soon I realised I didn't want to settle down is because I only wanted to settle down with her.
Dear S,
I'm sorry for hurting you. I know I can never turn back the time. You've always been the one for me. A part of me will always love you. I deeply regret letting you go and I understand why you removed me from your life. You deserve the best. I wish you a blissful, happy and longlasting marriage with J. He is a lucky man to have your love and I hope he cherish you forever.

60271,106439,"Met this guy a year ago through tinder, the photo that's being used was a side profile one, height stated was 171 which is way shorter than my expectation, but since the chat on tinder and/or tele is not bad, I decided to give it a go and met up with him after chatting for less than a few days, to my horror, he look way different than his profile pic. One day before meeting up, we didn't text for a day and so I texted him in the evening to confirm if we are still meeting, he said yes and he's glad that I texted him instead cause he didn't want to double text me and look like a simp. How's that double texting when I responded to his goodnight but just so happen that the last text was by him? So yea after meeting up, I have never felt embarrassed to walk beside anyone before and I felt it, I cut it short by making an excuse that I need to go right after dinner. What actually makes me go was that he can say it to me that everyone thinks that he looks way better in person than his picture, but unless his 'everyone' is his mom, I wouldn't believe it. I thought I made it clear that I have to go urgently and I even said I wanted to go to the herbal tea shop alone, yet he still follows me. Guess what, after the dinner I didn't text him, and he triple text me, what happens to not wanting to be a simp or whatever it is about not wanting to double text someone?

60263,106408,"Uncertain plans for the future
Hi guys, I am a 24M in NUS psychology. As a guy who is rather soft and emotional due to experiencing much setbacks, dramas that are forced upon me, I am more of a person who prefers a slow pace of life. I believed being happy is the most important thing in life and while I do not need to be extremely rich, being poor is a no-no. However, I am easily swayed by what others say about my decision.
When I told some of my friends how I planned to move to Malaysia after working full time until I am 30 once I complete my studies in 2 years (considering I currently already have 100KSGD that I saved up over part time jobs ever since my O level days and investing in shares), they commented how unambitious I am.
Thus I am really uncertain. Is it wrong to want a simple, peaceful, slower pace of life? I worked part time and studied for close to 10 years just in hopes to reach my goal faster, while everyone just brush me off as incompetent.
TL:DR I know people in the comments will be commenting my current balance isn't enough to migrate to Malaysia , thus I mentioned migrating when I am 30. Which will be about 6 years of full time working after I finished my degree in 2 years time (I will be 24 by then). I think I can afford a car and terrace house in Malaysia by then?
My apologies for the lowkey flexing of my balance, as I am very proud of myself considering my parents did not contribute any $$$

Although in the past we met often (5/6 times a week) to chill. Even if each meetup is 2-3h for dinner. But recently I suggested to her that we should meet lesser as all she wants to talk about is her insecurities & doubts. But I hate such confrontation man.
When she suggest to maintain the frequency we meet, I’m just doing it to make her happy. But I do find her clingy/sticky now. Cause she place me on high importance and made her life revolve around me.
In summary… I used to enjoy her presence. Now I felt that I’m just meeting her out of obligation. Maybe my heart isn’t fully into her nor wanting this rs anymore. She is a nice lady, and I really don’t want to hurt her. But breaking up with her for good is in my consideration.

60256,106395,"I was a scholar, did decently well, went on to management associate programme then completed my Masters. Wife is few years younger, attractive and I started dating her when she was an undergraduate. I'm few years older than my wife (hence more mature in life) and somewhat successful until early career. I'm also expected to have a higher earning potential than her.
My role has been nothing but supportive to her, and in her words, she won't be here if not for the guidance, advice and support for her.
I'm struggling now in my personal life and career. When Covid hit, we were badly hit. While she was able to pull through and managed to land a job in something like Big Tech (with awesome benefits package etc). She is also being valued at work, and is poised for promotion soon.
On the other hand, I feel like my life has been in a downward spiral. To name a few, I became obese (BMI 30) and past year attempts to lose weight haven't been successful. My career seemed to have become those do minimal at work and already plateau. How I ended up here is another story. Trying to find job has been unexpectedly bad. I don't know if I can blame the economic condition. I'm struggling to find motivation. Sometimes I just want to stay home and take care of our kid. The more I think about that, the more depressed I feel. I don't think I'm clinically depressed.
I love my wife very much, and I am proud of her success and at the same time jealous that she is going to live the career dream I want and I'm no where near. Jealous to the extent that I'm whining that she is so busy with work, and wants more attention. I am using the term 'jealous' instead of 'envious' because I feel that I may start to sabotage her career by guilting her to spending more time with family etc simply because I am spending more time at home.
At times, her company has functions that I have not participated as her spouse. I feel ashamed of where I am, and not worthy of the rising star in the company. She has many colleagues who are even more successful than her (earning a million every few years). I just don't see how I could fit in with them unless they are a bunch of housewives.
I know gender roles are pretty ingrained in me, and that's also the case for my extended family. I want to be supportive of her but the stark difference in our career is creating a huge imbalance in me. While I have been ""leading"", I have often thought I should just be the ""smaller"" person, and quietly supporting her. But I feel sad, that I am not even 10% of my full potential. We communicate very frankly and openly with each other. I shared these thoughts with her, and she just still believe that I can still ""make it"" and once I do, I would be in much better career than her. To be honest, I feel battered especially after the past few years and all I'm seeing is me being more and more left behind.

Funny you should say that. I’ve also been working for around 10 years now. I just attended a JC reunion, went to RJ, and the most successful person was the person I least expected to make anything of himself, mostly because he flunked out of J1. Let’s call him Nick. From what I remember, he took his A levels as a private candidate or something, and he got into NTU. Then he dropped out of NTU and became a real estate agent. Shortly after, he started to write a condo management software which he built for several years before selling it recently for a lot of money to an Australian company. I don’t know the exact amount but it was 8 figures and I didn’t even hear it from him. I had a lawyer friend who was on the M&A team for this deal.
Many of my classmates went to top overseas universities. I myself went to NYU for chemical and bio engineering and did my MBA at UChicago. I just hit a 5-figure monthly last year and I traded an arm and a leg for it. I was around 75th percentile at RJ and barring the scholars, all the best students seem to be doing alright but not spectacularly.
Nick didn’t only flunk out, he was one of the most disruptive jokers and pranksters at RI. I knew him since I was sec 3 and he was always trying to crack jokes in class, he was dozing off all the time, he pulled childish pranks on classmates, he cheats during exams, he copies homework, he made a habit out of playing hooky. As a close friend of his, it never occurred to me that he wasn’t smart. He was just about as bright as anyone I met at RI. You can tell this by just talking to him. He just had a different personality.
So it is true that we haven't the faintest idea who will make it big and who will not. We do know that if you do well in school the probability that you will be middle-class is high. But it takes a lot more fairy dust to go higher than that.

Can we marry tenets of Socialism, Capitalism and Meritocracy, abolish money and uphold ideals of shared wealth, toss out the notion of individual wealth at the expense of others with no form of caste or class discrimination?
Can we break down cultural walls and nationalism so that different nationalities and cultures live together without subjugating another culture to their own, creating one central body whose interdependence doesn't mean member states lose their culture to homogenization in a multilateral alliance but live in harmony,
Can we live in a shared land where there are no borders, expansion and protection of borders, achieving universal liberty, rights, and equality, sharing knowledge and resources in peaceful cooperation?
Can we share technologies are one collective species, working towards a shared goal for the mutual benefit of all, for the benefit of current and future generations? Technologies and scientific development actively researched, created and brought to live, not buying patents and storing them in some hidden cupboard for fears of inhibiting/impacting financial growth of a company...or that of the individuals who only seek financial rewards but not advancing the humanity's advancements up the Kardashev Scale?
Across the ages, humanity has only fought with each other for not just resources, but territories and personal ambitions.
As one who grew up loving the world of science fiction, one can't help but wonder if humanity can grow from its infancy as a civilisation, embracing values of benevolence, peaceful co-existence and co-operation can propel us in reality. Material needs, obsession with accumulation of possessions and money no longer exists, and in its place, with the drive towards self-improvement, self-enrichment, and the betterment of all Humanity.
Perhaps we can all become a space faring species, bringing to reality a dream and travel throughout the stars, spreading our principles, with the purpose of furthering the universal rights of all sentient life.

60274,106446,"Adding on my point from post #106408
I did not mention in my last post that my parents contributed 0 to what I have. Honestly speaking despite studying psychology, I have 0 respect for them.
They frankly use violence to teach in my childhood. My elder sisters and I were scolded for even the slightest of things, even when we tried to help. And they were pretty much absent in our childhood. It is my now-deceased grandmother that took care of us in our childhood. And while my elder sisters frequently bullied me in my childhood, my parents did not stood up and instead despise me because I am a ""boy"", I should fight back. And the only thing I owe to my parents is them giving birth to me and giving me supporting me
financially in my secondary and JC days. They weren't there physically still.
And they were the most disgusting people in my life. When my grandmother died, my parents were fighting over the inheritance money over my uncles and aunts. They constantly mentioned how they will be giving me a private property in the future because I am the only son but I do not count on it. Because their logic in life is so twisted, such that I am not willing to stay with them any longer. They literally have the mindset women must give birth and I can see them forcing my future wife to have child next time. Both my parents and my future wife is my responsibility. If either of them are mistreated, I will not standby and allow it.
So yes to those comments who think I am ungrateful POS, please understand my parents can force their shit on us and think they deserve respect despite done nothing except for mentally torturing us in our childhood. They are physically abusive and even as adults they still hit us while we as children (still owe them for giving birth to us) cannot defend ourselves by retaliating back.

60275,106447,"After working for 10 years, I think young uni students need to remind themselves that the industry is nothing like school. People who do very well in school will generally do much better than the average income earner, but there isn’t any reliable metric that we know of to predict how far up the corporate hierarchy you can go based on how well you’ve done in school. I work for a multinational, and the most successful Singaporean in the company, in fact one of the only non-American partner at the firm who is based in Singapore, was a poly student who graduated from Tasmania. One level down, and many of my Singaporean associate directors come from an enormous variety of backgrounds, none of whom did particularly well in school.
In Singapore, it is not uncommon to hear of young graduates from Cambridge or Oxford or an Ivy League university and it is easy to think that the competition is overwhelming. In reality we honestly don’t know how well these people will do. Being a very good student comes down to two things, natural intelligence and discipline. At work, many other traits are rewarded. It isn’t an asset to be sociable in school but the managing director of sales at our company made 700K last year. I worked on her team for a year and our job was primarily talking to customers and building relationships in the industry. Nothing technical. In school, if you’re the most technical person you’ll end up at MIT; at work, if you’re the most technical person it is rare that you will make management. If you do make management as a genius engineer it would have been for reasons other than your engineering skills.
Success in the world of business is even more varied. I have met owners of a small family business that make close to a million in profit every year from just managing rental properties for landlords. They clean, they market, they find tenants, and they earn a fee from doing it. I have met a marble dealer who made 2.5 million profit last year. I meet a lot of business owners because of my work in consulting.
It’s fine to be proud of scholastic achievements. It’s fine to pursue it hammer and tongs. But know that the world is enormous and people are rewarded for many skills and traits that many people would deem useless.

I am someone who went into a relationship rather quickly, I don't consider much so long as he fit my criteria and the feeling is mutual. Right now, I am in a healthy relationship myself and I would like to share with people that it's easy to recognize a toxic relationship after you take a step back and see it from a third person POV. I am pretty sure when people are in a bad relationship, they too know it as well, be it whether you have invested too much (like my case before), or you don't love yourself well enough and hope that someone will save you (also my case). After ending a few relationship that's bad for me, I realise what those have in common is each time a break up happens, I am the one who's begging for them to return to me, which is very degrading for myself, I put them in pedestal and forgot that I am someone who's deserving of love. I wasn't in a good place to receive and yet I kept giving till there was nothing good left.
Most of my friends can see that those relationships are slowly eating me away and yet I couldn't see it myself, I invested way too much emotionally, and I got comfortable to a point that it wasn't good anymore. Cheating, emotionally abuse, especially the latter, isn't something that I am familiar with until I read up myself, it got you to thinking that maybe, there's something wrong in myself after all.
What I hope to put it across is, don't be afraid to step out if you find yourself in a toxic relationship or you suspect that you are abuse emotionally. Walk out, and I can guarantee that it may not be on the actual day that you will feel it, but weeks or months later, you will feel that it's easier to breathe, you will be smiling more.
I met my current boyfriend on dating app and he's the best that can happen to me after I have cleared my head well and being in a emotionally well place to receive love and also, to give love. He's everything that my ex isn't, he calls when he says he will, he sends me home late at night even it means he has to cab home himself, he stills do those things that he did when he woos me, basically his actions speaks volume. He's still the same as he is from the start till we are a year into the relationship now.
To everyone who's suffering in their relationship, walk out now, and I hope that your next relationship will be the one that makes you smile more.

Maybe it is a mismatch in expectations, alternatively it really is hopeless to bother as an adult with commitments from career and family (and NS). I see some sports that others looked like they were doing since before they left the education system to various degrees, and they have related/adjacent experience on top. Some of them caught my interest, but I don't see how I can start, or even if I do, how meaningful it would be. Yes, discovering that a sport might not be my cup of tea/what I thought it might be is one thing, but how far should such attempts at trying out, if possible and available, go before the call to stop is made?
I definitely did not do sports in the above-mentioned stages of the education system. Schools I was from, they were play to win. And I feel like a klutz on land, so forget sports like soccer, rugby, tennis, badminton, frisbee, etc. I did get the certs to say I would survive a ship sinking scenario, but that's it.
As for why I would like to pick up a sport, because I feel that running down the NS Fit counter and attempting the IPPT only to fail is not a sustainable strategy long term. Guess I'll just keep to this way until I start having to default.
Maybe I should be angry at myself for not seeing earlier that this was something I might have been interested in, but did not know where or how to do it outside of what I already had, which did not include such sports.
Or maybe I should blame my parents for not marshalling me to do such things beyond the 'bare minimum' of certificates to not drown and/or not putting up the resources to do such things beyond those survival swimming awards.
TL;DR: Too late to start such sports I feel like I might be interested in, or at least I don't see (any hope as) how to as an adult.

60258,106398,"To Dimples, who was my favourite person, sorry I lost my temper that night. The truth is, at first, it was really just for fun and nothing serious. But those first 3 weeks of texting everyday, making me laugh and saying goodnights got me attached. After awhile, I told you I liked you a lot. Thank you for handling all my brutal honesty; you always know what to say in awkward situations even when I'm drunk texting you. But things changed, from bad to worse. I tried really hard to even be a friend. Because I wanted you in my life but I always got told to fuck off, so finally I did. Maybe next time I'll use my brain more and less of how I feel. Anyway, I just really wanna say sorry and wish you well. This is so generic but since I have no ways to reach you, I hope it finds you. From K $3000
PS. Bit tipsy. But it doesn't make everything I say less true. I do miss how nice you smell.

60268,106423,"Current undergraduate here. I see there is a water polo team in NUS - teamNUS Water Polo. I remember mention of a recreational team in Semester 1. Does anyone know what it is like? Are they still accepting members for the recreational team?
I also see there is an academy for adults by SportSG under ActiveSG. I have credits I can use, but has anyone participated?
If I want to try out water polo, which one should I go for?
I cam swim without issues, though speed and strength may be a concern given how fast-paced and how powerful the throws in waterpolo look. Many thanks for opinions/thoughts/advice!

The most important thing that you have to do is accept that she is gone from your life forever and forgive yourself for making that mistake of letting her go. Once you do that, things will start to fall into place.
Of course, it is easier said than done as i am also struggling to do so - letting go of my first girlfriend whom I broke up cos I was bored and wanted to date other people. I tried to chase her back when I realised my mistake but it was too late. I was devastated when I found out she chose the other guy and heartbroken when I found out she decided to marry him. Leaving me with nothing but regrets, memories of our happy times together and unrealised plans/dreams.
If you have not done so, try to practise self-forgiveness, telling ourselves that we made a mistake and should move on. Because life is too short to look backwards and time travel has not been invented yet. Living in the past does no one any good.
And if needed, to take a break from dating others so that you can reset/recalibrate your requirements for a partner. I regret not doing this as I tried to numb my sorrow by jumping prematurely into another relationship which resulted in more regrets and drama. I regret not recognising that it is okay to be partner-less.
If your emotions/thoughts becomes too much and overbearing, sometimes it is good to let it all out by writing. It doesn't need to be coherent. I do it during those troubled nights to release those dark thoughts.
If all else fails, I recommend counselling - although friends can help to listen but sometimes, speaking to an unbiased and new person really helps. The paid options aren't cheap but there are free ones out there which may not be as good but hey, you can use the money saved to treat yourself.
Overall, be kinder to yourself. We all make mistakes and we should learn to forgive ourselves. Sometimes, our regret stems from us not being able to forgive ourselves. And doing so, may help us heal and finally move forward in life. I hope to reach that state one day and I wish you all the best in your own journey.
