I feel you deserve to know what's going on behind the scenes. 
When I first started out my stint in NUS handling leasing, I actually found joy in the role. Our management back then had the community's welfare as a priority. We had meetings to discuss how to bring in a wider tenant mix to cater to growing demands, and also how to support existing tenants to better serve NUS (though some are a total b****!!).
Some years back, major changes happened to the management. Almost instantly, we had to become a profit center. In other words, our department's KPI was to make more money by bringing in tenants who could deliver higher returns.
Isn't this what all landlords are doing? Yes and No. All landlords (i.e. my big bosses) want to maximise earnings - that's just the reality. But when I joined NUS, our team genuinely believed in putting community first. We bring in variety and manage prices on our campuses. I actually spoke the new VP about how his change will impact our students, but it turned out to be like the saying - putting my warm face on a cold ass. Pui!
Over the years, I've been feeling jaded about it. It's not just NUS, my next job is not any better. Finding from my ex-colleagues who are still around in NUS, most tenants now are chains who can pay higher rates and pay higher GTO. They're also finding it harder to get them to comply to NUS policies simply because ""that's how their procedures are"". Too bad, policy change, now KPI depends on this.
I do miss the old days. I did have a good time working in NUS under my old boss, when we felt that what we were doing was meaningful.

Don't neglect the campuses outside Kent Ridge too. Although some of the food options at main campus are alittle more wallet friendly than what we get at the satellite campuses, I agree that there is an increase in major f&b chains where profit becomes the primary objective. 
The satellite campuses do not get many f&b options and the vendors brought in are not up to standard and prices are exorbitant. Walking out to eat becomes a norm but the food options around the area are even more expensive in some cases (even with staff discount). I hope some attention can be given to satellite campuses to also protect our wallets because we are also from the same payroll and same job grades.
