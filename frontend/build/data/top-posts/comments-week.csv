60953,107898,"What kind I actually expect from a girl in a relationship? This is a genuine question. I am all for woman empowerment. Women have the right to enjoy life and be successful. In the past, females would do household chores, take of children, cook, etc. whereas the guys would do the earning, in charge of protecting the family, etc.. Now, everyone says that it is suppose to be 50-50 so everything is split and I am totally all for this. However, it honestly doesn't feel that way.
I am going to generalise a little here based on my friends, what I read and my own personal experience so don't get offended. LOL.
In general, in the courting stage, personally I feel that guys have to do more work - pay for first date, try to impress the girl, plan for the dates, must tolerate the girls bs (some girls literally put that on their dating profile), have to be more successful in career (yeah, even successful girls seem to want someone who is equally or more successful than them), still do the protecting, etc. Girls don't need to plan for dates, just come to the date and expect the guy to carry the conversation (not all girls like that but a lot of them are), expect guy to be humorous (when they are not humorous themselves), etc. The worst thing is that sometimes they complain about the date or complain about the conversation flow without putting any effort into the date or conversation. The best part is that are expecting me to guess what kind of date they want by doing mind-reading. 
In the steady relationship stage, guys still do more work, still planning dates, planning and spending for special occasions, etc. When a guy's planned date goes horribly wrong, it is my fault. Everything is my fault. Earth is a sphere, yes, it is my fault that it isn't cube. Just kidding.
I am in a relationship and I have to put in a lot of effort to maintain it. The worst part is that a lot of the effort goes unseen. I understand that it isn't going to be even but I don't feel like my partner is putting much at all. One day, I asked my gf if she can try a more sexier style for me and she said no. I asked maybe just wear for dates (not change your style everyday) and she downright said no and said that I was objectifying woman. I am a visual person and I have preferences but if she is uncomfortable, then I told her that I won't force her and I backed off. I asked if we can try some spicy stuff in bed and she said no. Fine, I backed off again. I asked her if she could do some planning for dates as I was really busy with work. Her dates were bare minimum effort and weren't thoughtful about me but in her mind, they were amazing. After a few months, she was complaining to her friends that she didn't feel like a priority to me, so I started to plan again while juggling my stressful work. 
Planning a date while having 9 to 5 job is way different from having to plan a date while doing OT till 9pm almost everyday. 
Barbie is my gf's favourite character like ever. Normally, I would tell her to watch with her friends and she would be fine with it.  Since it was her fav character, she wanted to watch with me. I was really not interested in watching the movie. I wanted to watch Oppenheimer with my friends. She said that I valued my friends more than her because I am choosing my friends instead. So I have to make the sacrifice.
The best part in all of this was this particular dinner. I was having dinner with her family. First, she complained that I was dressed sloppily. To me, I already met her parents a lot of times so I wanted to wear something casual and comfortable. So I am not allowed to comment on her style while she can control mine. Then, I blabbered something to her parents (something about her work) which she told me not to tell them. It was a honest mistake and I apologized to her. She said that I cannot keep secret and needed to think about our relationship, basically, considering breaking up with me. I am not going to downplay my actions, yes I hurt her and it wasn't right but considering breakup....seriously?
I have made so much more sacrifices for her than her and I put in way more effort than her. Girls expect guys to be successful in our career but complain that we don't put in time for our relationship. Now, she can just break up with me and all the years of effort becomes nothing instantly. 
In summary,
I cannot ask her to dress in a certain way for me or I cannot ask her to try spicy things in bed because I am a pervert and misogynist. I cannot ask her to plan or put in effort for dates or conversations. I cannot ask her to plan Valentine's day for me instead because traditionally, guys are suppose to be the ones doing and all her friends have awesome dates planned by guys. I thought we threw traditions away and replaced it with equality? Basically, I feel as though they choose everything that is beneficial for them and ignore everything that is non-beneficial for them. 
I just want to know exactly what guys can ask or expect from a girl to contribute in a relationship? What is their role in a relationship?

60957,107907,"how do you approach a colleague who owes you lunch money? 
I have been lunching with colleagues and sometimes involved me footing for the bill first at a restaurant / cafe. While this not usually often, we do treat ourselves at nicer casual restaurants/ cafes at times for a great catch up during lunch.
We all take turns to pay usually - and when I say “We” they are not the same people most of the time, hence the “need” to hang out at better places to have a better ambience to chat. I will usually check how much is my share, and immediately paynow or return cash to the paying colleague (incl of the taxes).
However when it is my turn to pay, I do get episodes of colleagues forgetting to pay me back, and I believe they are genuine, because of busy schedules they forget as they did mention they would do so “later”.
To put the situation into a better context, we are all middle aged adults drawing an average of 5-fig salary, but to me it is still money - though the bill can range between $15-$25. And because we are all adults of certain level and payscale, it seems (very) petty enough of me to ask them about the owed lunch money, worse still we dont really meet daily. I guess it definitely isn’t an issue if I were to say it was a treat from me, but no it’s an AA go-dutch lunch. And I cannot be consoling myself to forget it - take it as a treat when clearly it was not.
How will you approach for someone to pay you back in such a situation? While it can be deemed a small amount, it definitely is not , especially if this happens more than once, and it is also a matter of principle when it comes to such.

60954,107899,"When is it a boundary and when is it controlling (behaviour)? I can't figure it out. I find it very hard not to have any expectation of your partner in the relationship. I always thought open communication about your expectations was the key but apparently, it is not (look at the end).
When you go into a relationship, you do expect some things from your partner (either explicitly and in most cases, implicitly). You expect your partner to support you, be there for you, pamper you, put in effort for you, go on dates with you, etc. If you have no expectations from your partner, then you will never be unhappy right? If your date cancels on you last minute, you won't be unhappy because you don't expect your date to show up. If your partner forgets your birthday, then you won't be unhappy because you don't have expectations on your partner to celebrate it with you. 
Someone asked me if I would let my gf go clubbing with her friends (let's assume there are guys).  I feel like this is a landmine question.
I have had friends who cheated on their bfs/gfs (yes both ways) when they go clubbing. Yes, their partner put full trust in them and they took advantage of it. Not everyone is the same but it is very hard. Again, there are those that cheat at work or other places as well so no gurantee. 
So honestly, I don't feel comfortable if my gf went clubbing with her friends but if I start restricting her, then she would feel that I don't trust her. While drinking, you are not at your 100% and you might just screw it up (cheat accidentally). If that happens, then bye bye relationship. If I start restricting her, she will feel suffocated and that I am controlling her. If I let her go into risky situations, then the relationship could potential get messed over a stupid thing. 
So if your bf asked if you are ok with him helping a female colleague, who is flirty, young and dresses sexily, after work hours, would you be ok? In my mind, my thoughts are genuine and I have no feelings for her. On the other hand, girls would say that this is so red flaggy and I want to seriously meet the girl who says she is fine with this hahaha.....
Apparently, boundaries are things that you place on yourself and are not expectations of another person. 
If my gf is posting sexy pics of herself on instagram and I am not comfortable with it, am I allowed to request her not to do it? Am I allowed to tell her that I am insecure about it and it would put my mind at ease if she didn't do it? If I said that if she stills want to continue posting such pics, then I don't want to be in this relationship, is that fine? The answer is no because I would taking away her freedom to express herself and I am controlling her. By threatening an exit from the relationship, I am basically manipulating her. A woman can wear what she want and I cannot place an expectation on her. It is not a boundary, it is an expectation and controlling behaviour. 
When you marry someone, you do expect the person to be loyal and not cheat which is a blatant expectation. One day your partner says they have a certain fetish or kink but you are not willing to do it for them. Is it ok if they seek satisfaction from an external party instead? Most normal couples would say no (except open relationships which we will put aside). Isn't this controlling? They do want to express their sexuality in a certain way. I know this is an extreme example. 
If you date someone, a gf expects her bf to buy things or spend on gifts on Valentine's day. If the bf doesn't do it, then the gf will be angry. Isn't this controlling in the sense you are expecting your partner to do something for you on Valentine, especially when all the prices are all jacked up?
I expect my gf not to cheat on me. If my gf cheats on me, I would leave the relationship. It is a blatant expectation right? Is this a controlling behaviour?
I like to chat with girls and dm into their socials. I just like chatting and that is all. It is fun and gives me a little validation. If my gf says I cannot do this, is this controlling or a boundary?
As a guy, I am married to a girl. After marrying, I realise that I like to wear female clothing. Say I wear sexy female clothing and post it on instagram to express myself. My wife asks me to take down my pics and instagram page and threatens to leave the relationship if I don't. IShe is feeling embarrassed about her husband and a lot of people are commenting. Is she controlling or setting a boundary? A man can wear what he wants right? or can he? 
My close friend who is a female gives me hugs and kisses to show her love. We don't have any weird feelings except for bro-sis feelings. My gf tells me that she is insecure and wants me to at least stop touching each other. Is she controlling or setting a boundary? 
Last example, I love drinking alcohol a lot. I drink with a lot of people and it does cost a lot of money. If my gf asks me to cut down and not waste too much money on alcohol, is it a boundary or controlling? She is afraid my health is at risk and too much money down the drain. Is this fair? But I love drinking, it is my way to connect and enjoy life. Controlling or not?
Initially, I thought that if I communicated my ""expectations"" (let's not say use the term ""boundaries"") like not posting sexy pics or clubbing till 4am in the morning with her friends, she is agreeable, then it is fine. If she doesn't agree, she is fine to find someone else who doesn't have such restrictions. I just don't want to worry over stupid things. The most important thing in my mind is that we don't force someone to do something they don't and if they don't agree with what you want/expect from a partner, they are fine to leave. However, it has come to my knowledge that even stating your ""expectations"" to someone is toxic and manipulative, like the Jonah Hill incident. Maybe he phrased it wrongly but basically, he just stated his ""expectations"" and if she felt suffocated, she could have just stated no to them and don't even get into a relationship with him. I do agree that was not a smart move to pick a girl that conflicted with his ""expectations"" in the first place but I don't think he needed to receive so much backlash. Obviously his ""expectations"" conflicted with her job so she could have just said no from the get go. Why make a hu ha about it?
If you realise your partner does not fit your expectation, you can find someone else. What if you are married and your partner doesn't fit your expectations? How would you reconcile then? No is perfect without insecurities. What is the right way to approach this?

Ever since I'm a kid, I'm always unwanted by girls, probably cause I'm physically unattractive. It's understandable really, so I accepted that I'll be with no one. 
In university, when everyone else got into a relationship, I was always the single one. My female classmates often made fun of me, saying my face is a wreck and I'll never be able to attract anyone with my look. They always insult my looks everyday. It doesn't hurt me cause I've long accepted it. I never fight back. 
One day, a coursemate , who happens to be my crush, that I've worked together for years, confessed to me that she liked me.  Of course, this is new to me. I asked what about me that she likes, and she said that I have a great personality, a ""husband material"", and for some reason, she said a bonus for her is that I have a great physical look. Of course, I was shock. Things like this never happened. I decided to open up my heart even more and start a relationship with her. 
But here's where I don't understand. Months after I got into a relationship, suddenly, my female classmates has been...different. Like they were flirting with me, asking me out on dates, and giving me gifts. Some other woman from different course flirted with me too. My female classmates even tried to sabotage my relationship but failed. They even fought againts each other cause they were trying to win my heart. 
I'm really not trying to brag. This is new to me. So my question is, why do I suddenly appeared to be attractive when I have a gf? Aside from the fact I have a gf, my looks are the same, my personality are the same, and I'm not rich either. My gf accepted me for the way I am and we're building things up from scratch.

My husband is someone non confrontational, meek if u want to call it, nice guy to make it sound better and generally soft spoken.
I on the other hand am the complete opposite, im loud and not afraid to confront, nice girl too i need to add this. I wasn’t raised to be like this so I believe it’s because of how he is I had to “woman up”. I became protective and fierce, I became his voice even if necessary.
18 years together n he has never once once stood infront of the auntie who pushed me aside just get ahead of the line and ask her to F off, not that I’ll ask her to F off too but telling me to live and let live and said I’m overreacting instead. But maybe it is my fault because he knows I can handle it all own my own, maybe he thinks I’m capable of throwing hands so he just need to stand back n watch since I’m so “independent”. 
So an incident happened recently and it made me rethink my marriage. Rethink our 18 years. Perhaps enough is enough, perhaps I just need someone to take my side.
A friend of ours raised his voice at me because he assumed I did something but my husband was the one who did that something. I was shocked, embarrassed and pissed he would talk to a grownass woman that way. I proceeded to calmly yet curtly addressed the situation without getting all worked up and when he realised it was a misunderstand that said friend just bashfully smile n retreat. Not even an apology. 
We reached home I asked my husband why did he do that. Why didnt he 1. Ask that friend to stfu n don’t talk to me in that tone 2. Didn’t even admit he was e culprit who did that thing and just kept quiet the whole time. He laughed in my face and ask me if I’m okay, the incident was hours ago and it was “nothing”, that friend was just talking he didn’t even raise his voice n best, “nothing to admit what”. 
I flipped because he said I’m overreacting. I’m OVERREACTING when that friend raised his voice at me and the room went silent. It was awkward but nothing to my husband. 
I woke up today really thinking about the life we have, am I able to continue living with this man who likes to be in the shadows of his peers, who prefer to be unnoticed and unheard, who rather let his wife fight her battles, whose food is served wrongly but when the waiter ask how r things he smiles n says GREAT. What is so great about a grilled dory when u ordered steak?

60964,107918,"In life, we often have things that are out of our control and things within our control. All we need to do is distinguish which issue belongs to which cat.
Parent is an example. We don't get to choose who our parent is- some are lucky to be born a golden/silver spoon, while some had to learn life the hard way by going through many hardships just to get more comfortable in life.
While some may have had it easy to have a parent supporting them through different life stages, some may struggle to pay off debt accumulated through different life stages. So, if you are one of those who experienced hardship and resent your parent for not being a better provider, it may be easier/better to look at the amount of sacrifice they endured raising you as a child. 
 
A well-to-do parent does not make one a good parent. Similarly, a less well-to-do parent does not make them a bad parent. Some less well-off parent works multiple jobs just to ensure they can provide their kids an equal opportunity as kids of the better off family. In contrast, some well-off parents cannot afford the time to spend with their kids simply because they are busy all the time because they are also compensating their time for their kid's education and future.
I am saying this not because people who have encountered toxic parents don't have the right to resent their parents but if you choose to forgo your resentment and look past the bad, you may find yourself in a happier place.  And if you think about it, they don't have that much time left in this world to be there with you. So count your blessing if you even have one to be there, nagging at you every day.

60967,107943,"NUS has once again, in typical NUS fashion, demonstrated how NOT to engage staff.
Despite many Focus Groups indicating a desire for hybrid work arrangements, the University sent out a circular announcing an almost-complete return to office. A blanket policy for all departments regardless of the differing needs and practices of each sub-unit.
Ironically, upper management previously assured us that policies will be made with flexibility of different sub-units in mind.
As a long-time staff, I am disappointed that the University put on a facade of listening, only to implement a policy counter to the opinion of the masses, effectively slapping us in the face.
Such an employer deserves no loyalty.

60968,107947,"I graduated in 2020 from NUS cs. I was just an average student with second lower. I seriously have no idea why so many people vying for swe position thinking they can earn a lot. The salary range is actually very big and is only outlier earning the big bucks. I started off as swe. But switched to customer support engineer in a sme. Ex classmates started laughing at me when I told them I become  customer support engineer. Lol in my mind I'm just thinking I am making 190k sgd a year which is 2 times my salary when I started 3 years ago. Not sure if they even command this salary~
