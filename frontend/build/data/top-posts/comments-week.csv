This fellow exchange student is from a very wealthy family, parents have a car each and she even has her own car. Unfortunately, she knows that I am not so well to do. She went like “your family doesn’t even own a car right, so what’s the point of all of them coming all the way down… *snobbish laughter* just to take mrt back with you?!”
