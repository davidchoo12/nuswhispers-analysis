61101,108190,"I have been in relationship with my bf for around 2.5 years. Everything is great. Hes very loyal and no problems at all. But 1 thing he always does is he takes money from me all the time due to his gambling habit previously. I have a part time job and i get salary after every shift. When he knows im getting my salary he will immediately call me and ask me to trf half of the salary. Claiming he has no money and need money for his food, ciggs. Almost everyday i trf him half of my salary and the next day he will come and ask me more money for him. Even if i say i don't have enough he will keep insisting on it and keep irritating me and disturbing me to borrow money from others to give him. He owes me till date arnd $28K. But he say that i have failed as a gf and i throw him in the fire. Just cause my cousins told me to stop giving him money as he should earn for himself and not be taking it from me. (They only found out abt this issue 2 days ago) 
I love him alot. But i am so hurt that he say i have failed as a gf. 
What should I do?

61099,108187,"Recently I met a guy on a dating app and he suggested to meet up which I agreed. We went to a cafe and ordered a coffee each. Afterwards, he suggested a walk in a shopping mall so I thought he was interested to know me more after the coffee date. It got closer to dinner time and he suggested to eat at a food court which was super crowded and definitely not a good place to talk. Both of us come from decently wealthy families and work in very well-paid industries. I was not expecting a high-class restaurant or something, but maybe not a food court? Maybe some ramen restaurants or reasonably priced western food restaurants like Astons? So I am confused, is he interested in me? If yes, why did he suggest food court when I had introduced many other food options inside that shopping mall? If not, why did he suggest the walk and the dinner subsequently?

61108,108208,"I confessed to my fwb and now she is ignoring me..
We started off as platonic friends, one thing led to another and we became fwb. Apart from sex, we go out for meals, and chit chat whenever we meet. 
Through the conversation we had, I felt that we really clicked and she is a really well-mannered and filial girl. She said she yearns for company but is afraid of starting a relationship due to past experiences. Over time, I think I fell in love with her and I really want to protect her and make her happy.
I decided to pluck up my courage and told her that I hope we can go beyond fwb and do more things together as a couple… She immediately changed the topic, I thought perhaps she is shy and needs time to think through so I didn’t probe further. It has been 2 weeks and she is not replying my texts. Tbh I did not expect such a reaction. What should I do?

61095,108179,"I'm a 26F and my 27M boyfriend of 6 months is addicted to porn. He told me he masturbates to porn at least 2 times a week. We're physically intimate and monogamous, so I feel sad knowing I'm not enough to satisfy his urges. Furthermore, he told me that in the past he had visited a massage parlour once though he swears it was and is going to be that once only. I'm worried that his habit will worsen and he may potentially cheat on me in future or visit a massage parlour again. We talked about it and he told me he's taking steps to stop the porn habit and assured me it was the only challenge, with the other two concerns under control. I trust him and see a future with him, but I'm worried that his lack of self control may turn around to bite me in the future, such that whenever he goes out alone I can't help but worry that he may visit a parlour or cheat on me. Am I overreacting or is this a legitimate concern?

61103,108195,"At age 21 I felt my heart fully shatter for the first time. My first love of 2 years left me for someone else. He told me I don't turn him on and he don't love me anymore. He told me the other girl is so much hotter and has a sexier body. She was willing to do more so he picked her. Basically everything he said to me had hurt me, I felt stabs of pain drove through my heart for days. I've never felt so numb before in my life. We dated for over 18 month before I gave myself to him. I did everything that he wanted because I love him so much. I wanted him as much as he wanted me then. He was my first everything. I thought he was the one. He was so patient, loving and kind to me. Now I wonder were there others when we were seeing each other. Was anything real between us? How did I not see this coming?
How can I be on top of the world with him then and feel like I'm in hell now? I feel so worthless now. I yearn for him and I hate him. Why did he do this to me...... was our love ever real? Now I see that he changed his profile pic to him and that girl. My heart has gone numb. I never mattered to him? He got over me so quickly? My friends told me to ignore him as he's not worth it. How can I? How did the love vanish overnight? How do I move on? The pain is unbearable.

First of all to those people who keep talking about pretty privileges, I DO NOT DENY IT EXISTS. But we have it tough as well. I'm 24M, already some years over my NS days.

Not only that, I do know that I look better than average although I don't think I look good looking enough to be considered ""Handsome"".
Speaking chinese often, people around me tend to call me “清秀” and ""俊美” which I am not sure whether it is to be a compliment. They often mistake me as a Taiwanese/Korean. But I am starting to feel my looks are a hinderance to my relationship life. For f*ck sake, I got rejected by girls which only to be told by their friends that ""she thinks you're a player, but your looks rlly honestly give the f*ckboi vibes"".
什么 the f*ck? I can control how I look meh? I tried tanning my skin and it doesn't work at all. I cannot grow a beard, nor a mustache fits my face shape. I'm done bro, when guys ugly people call us ""simp, desperate”. When guys look better, people call us ""f*ckboi, player"". What is it u girls want??? WALAO.

61097,108184,"I had been in a relationship for five years, and it was the first serious one for both of us, which made it special in the beginning. I'm more of an indoor person, so my favorite dates involved spending time at his place, where we'd each do our own activities. He'd play games or watch funny videos while I enjoyed my shows or read novels. Occasionally, we'd have light-hearted conversations, sharing funny thoughts and laughing together before returning to our own interests. I felt very comfortable with how things were, and I believed he was the one for me.
We did have some differences – I tended to be more demanding, but he was incredibly accommodating. I grew up in a family that struggled to express affection, while he was more carefree and needed verbal expressions of love and emotional support due to his sensitivity. I didn't consider these differences a problem because he was so understanding, and I made an effort to communicate my feelings with love, even if there were times I was too harsh, which I later reflected and tried to change. 
We got a BTO (Built-to-Order) flat last year and were eagerly waiting for it. However, I wanted us to move out this year because we were both sharing our living spaces with our siblings. So, we decided to apply for an HDB rental for couples waiting for their flats. This change disrupted our plans, including our wedding timeline.
We had already scheduled photoshoots and set dates for ceremonies, and everything seemed to be going well. However, just one week before the wedding photoshoot, he expressed his concerns. He worried about the uncertainties in our future, whether we could bridge our differences, and the possibility of a future divorce, which was particularly alarming because his parents had gone through a painful divorce, leaving a lasting impact on him. I tried to reassure him that differences were normal in any relationship and that love could help us overcome them, but he remained anxious.
I suggested that we identify the instances where he felt uncomfortable with our future plans, and I promised to be reasonable and open to discussion. He began listing various concerns, including not liking the color of my wedding dress, which we had chosen two months earlier, and this triggered my frustration. I felt that if he had reservations, he should have voiced them earlier. He claimed that he didn't fully understand my perspective and only agreed due to my insistence, which left me puzzled.
I cherished his sweetness and willingness to accommodate my wishes. I believed we shared similar thoughts and could overcome any challenges together. However, his recent change in attitude was unsettling. I was willing to compromise further to address his concerns, but I couldn't understand why he was suddenly blaming me for issues we had previously resolved. 
This situation led to a heated argument, and I canceled the photoshoot, telling him that we wouldn't proceed with the wedding until he sorted out his feelings. I felt angry and hurt, as I hadn't pressured him into proposing, buying a BTO flat, or planning the wedding. It seemed like he was allowing his fears to take control and not considering the impact of his actions on me. I felt lost and regretted investing five years in a relationship with someone who seemed unwilling to mature and face our challenges. When it came to booking an appointment for our ROM, I thought it was reasonable to have him take care of it. He initially agreed and, within about 10 minutes, told me he had completed the task. Naturally, I asked him to share a screenshot or proof of the successful submission so that we both had a record, ready to be shown if needed on the day. However, two minutes later, he returned, explaining that the appointment was in ""draft"" status, indicating he hadn't submitted it.
This was the first time he had failed to submit something, but there had been other instances where he made similar mistakes, though of varying significance. Given our previous conversations about how he didn't appreciate my blunt criticism and didn't like being scolded, I chose not to react harshly. I simply said, ""Okay, could you please submit it now?"" in a gentle manner, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed.
I couldn't understand why he couldn't complete tasks accurately. I believed that if he were genuinely excited about marrying me, he would have double-checked and triple-checked everything to ensure its correctness. The thought of us, along with our parents, standing at the entrance of the ROM only to realize that we couldn't proceed due to a mistake was a worrisome scenario. It seemed like he struggled to grasp the consequences of his mistakes and continued to make similar errors.
This situation made me feel like I was in the role of a nagging mother, constantly reminding her child to complete their homework, and then checking it repeatedly. I was looking for a partner who could take responsibility and handle tasks like an adult, not someone who repeatedly made avoidable errors.
During our time together, I often found myself in a motherly role, pushing him to complete tasks with minimal effort, like learning to drive or booking an appointment for our ROM (Registry of Marriages). I felt disappointed when he didn't follow through or made avoidable mistakes. Despite our talks about improving, he continued to make the same errors, making me feel like I was constantly checking up on him.
What bothered me the most was his decision to back out just one week before the photoshoot. I expected him to take responsibility for his choices as an adult and not put me in such a difficult situation, with our wedding plans already publicly announced. It was an emotional ordeal, and I couldn't forgive him for running away at a crucial moment, which felt like abandonment.
I suggested that he should seek professional help to address his anxiety and uncertainty about the future, and we should take a step back until he could secure a doctor's appointment. Unfortunately, this plan unraveled on the very first day of our cooling-off period. I found myself shedding tears at random moments, constantly haunted by what had transpired.
On the second day, he engaged in some introspection and declared that he would step up and be more responsible for our relationship. I couldn't help but wonder if I could trust this commitment, given my deep disappointment and past letdowns. I realized that I should have recognized his issues earlier and not placed myself in this emotional turmoil. If we hadn't already announced our marriage and secured a flat, I might have considered ending the relationship immediately. Perhaps I was also being somewhat hesitant in my own way.
I'm now at a loss about what to do. While I've given him a chance, I still find myself awake in the late hours, contemplating how much time I have left in my youth and what would happen if I made the wrong choice. I can't shake the feeling of fear that he might run away again, especially before the ROM or even after we have a baby.
What should i do?

61098,108186,"My friends from ECE shared with me a video of an interview put out by their dept of their MSc student who apparently came from CS.
I found the entire video highly irregular and wrong in so many ways.
Why would any sane CS grad switch to engineering to do embedded systems? Previous confessions from seniors have confirmed the embedded industry is in decline. I can only conclude his skills are too poor to be an SWE thus he had to switch to hardware. A quick check online confirmed my suspicions that he was in CS when it was still a dumping ground. It's pathetic that the ECE dept has found this worthy.
Based on conversations with my ECE friends, I learn many engine grads don't end up practicing engineering, most aspire towards software or finance instead. Top ECE grads enter FAANG companies. Reality is entirely opposite from being portrayed.
I would argue against the point that finding software information is easy. If it is easy to self study online, why is CS so popular and even Profs like Prof Ben are complaining about his workload? If this is true, everybody can self study online to be an SWE instead of spending 4 years and paying so much for a CS degree. MSc and grad certs in CS, data science and AI are hugely popular post grad courses, surely more popular than masters in engineering which is supposedly harder to find information.
I don't get how working with obsolete machines is anymore useful to learning how modern computers work than actually working on modern machines. Can vintage machines do multi-threaded parallel processing? Can it do ML inferencing? Everyone is looking to the future yet this guy is stuck in the past.

61100,108189,"Regarding #108150:
There is nothing wrong with wanting to be rich. My father passed away when I was in secondary school because of a rare but curable cancer, and if we had $250,000 when he was diagnosed, he probably would not have died. He worked in construction and my mom worked at a nail salon. I have 3 siblings and we all lived in a one-bedder. I know a lot of people will disagree with me vehemently, but poverty is no fun.
I am now one year out of medical school and my goal is to give my family a better life. 
Believe me when I say I understand fully that money will be less than useless in death. To me, making money has never been about what I can spend it on. Money will enable me to be a safety net for my loved ones.
Buying unnecessary things, traveling, paying over the top for a meal, I have never quite understood the appeal of such things. Not that I ever could afford them in the first place. 
My best friend with whom I went to Hwa Chong grew up not too far from where Goh Chok Tong lives in Bukit Timah. He never spends more than $5 on a meal. It puzzled me in the beginning but then he revealed to me that he’s not being intentionally frugal he just found it difficult to justify how a $20 plate of chicken rice is 4x better than one he can get for $5. Today he is a Ivy League graduate who is in line to take over his father’s business, but he is still the same guy who wears washed out t shirts, takes the bus, and eats $3 cai fan whenever we do meet. 
When I was in medical school, I met friends from upper-middle class families who were as frugal as I am. It was only surprising how common they are, people whose parents are specialists, lawyers, businessmen who are more humble than a blade of grass. 
I’m not saying it’s wrong to live your life to the fullest. How anyone wants to live their life should be their prerogative. But I think if you want to mitigate the regret you will feel if you died prematurely by ignoring the fact that the vast majority of us will probably live as long as the life expectancy seems to suggest (84 years), then I think it would be a mistake not to make preparations for those ages that you will no longer be productive. 
Lastly I just want to say this, seeing the world can be a great experience, but the same critique that you can’t bring money to the grave can also be said about your memories. You bring nothing away because you simply cease to exist. People who obsess over money aren’t all shallow and materialistic. Some of us need it to pay for a better life for the people we care about.

61094,108177,"My Voice Before I Exit
Previously I couldn’t tell anyone because no one bothered to hear my side of the story. Everyone just joined in to bully and slut shame me because I was an easy target. This is my story before I exit . I may be here today I may not be tomorrow. It is just my last wish to have my side heard not be  blamed to absorb all the damages . 
My bullying existed since 2010 and it was been nearly 12 years of pain , anxiety and untreated trauma. 
It actually happened when I was still a minor . I was only 15 studying in secondary school.  I was talking to a guy but back then my bff another girl also liked him so she told everyone I stole her bf which I didn’t. She wasn’t even with him. 
To stop the bullying I was forced to apologise to her even though I didn’t do it . Then everyone thought cos I apologised I really stole her bf . 
What’s worse is she planned worse . She told me her guy friend was interested in me so I agreed to meet him . He tried to sexually groom me and one day he took me to his room because he wanted to play computer games with me . I was naive and young back then so i trusted him.  That guy took a topless video of me without my knowledge and without my consent through a hidden camera when I was only 15. He released it during my o level period with that girl to crash me. 
Because of it , I was bullied so severely I had to quit my poly . I was a top A student in secondary school and because of her jealousy she and him destroyed me . 
No one helped me during my trauma in secondary school. Because I was a nerd and always studied and kept to myself mostly . She and him knew my weakness . 
I tried going to the police but they shut down my case saying it was a he say she say thing , they told me an IO just went down to ask that guy , any obvious idiot would deny it . 
I was so traumatised that my mother brought me to see a psychiatrist at CGH. That doctor fed me anti psychotic drugs like I was a lab rat , back then those drugs were experimental and he gave me a pamphlet about the side effects it had, the dosage he gave made me go insane and I lose my senses , it also made me hyper sexualized . 
In the end I hurt guys while I was in that state . I did apologise to those guys for nearly causing sexual diseases and I acknowledged my mistake even though I had already lose my senses , I blamed myself and took the punishment but the bullying never ended . That was 5 years ago. I was slut shamed, sexualised and harassed everywhere in public and in office by men because of my mistakes.  I feel that I have been punished enough. 
In the end I had to visit a private psychiatrist to be fixed , the drugs from the private clinic had better purity than those in public , the doctor himself told me the publicly supplied drugs have too many fillers therefore caused more side effects .  You pay so much for that difference of quality and safety. The drugs temporarily helped but it cannot be taken forever . Those drugs have side effects and long term lead to drug dependency, doctor himself is ethical and told me to fight the bullying and reduce the dosage. 
But my bullies never let go of me. It had been 12 years since that topless video was spread but recently someone spread it again. It brought back a lot of childhood trauma . Felt so helpless when the police back then dismissed my case due to lack of evidence . Felt so traumatised when I was blamed for it and slut shamed , they even jeered at me saying I deserved it , I deserved to go crazy . 
I cried so much , because I realised now that they bullied me because I was weak , it wasn’t because I was really that way , so I felt like ending my life .
Even though I was going through all these I still went to work and faced these attacks on a daily basis , I can’t recover like this . There were some others who tried to reach out to me and help me but we ended up being harrassed together and everyone gave up. The environment is harsh. 
People who know are not helping me , felt that if the environment was kinder to me I could still hang on , but it was different , I was slut shamed further . That guy just got away and living his life Scot free , so is the girl .  Derek Lee and Gina Ng . 
Feel abandoned in a big bad world .  I know there are still nice and kind ppl in SG but I have met too many bad ones . To this day , I am sorry to the guys I have hurt while I was in a mentally unstable state. 
But I do want to give up and not feel grief and pain anymore . People who want to suicide do not want to kill themselves but to kill the pain . 
Good bye , my world and future has fallen apart . It is only a matter of time .

61096,108182,"So I just started working in a new job this week. Today was my 3rd day at work, and my manager asked me to create a slide deck to summarise a research paper. So I worked on it and at 1pm i gave her update saying that I will submit the deck either today or early the next day. She said she needs it by today, so I said ok. At 3pm she asked me when I can have the slides ready, I told her by 6pm, and she asked me why it takes so long. I was confused since I interpreted “by today” as end of day. Then she told me that if she didn’t give me a deadline, I should just ask for it. I informed her that I did try to align the deadline with her, but she responded by saying that she needs time to review my slides. And she even went on to say that while I need to ramp up on knowledge, she wants me to start contributing asap. 
Firstly, is it wrong of me to interpret her initial deadline as end of day? If she didn’t give me a specific time to submit the slides to her, am I supposed to read her mind? Was I wrong in this case?
Secondly, it’s my 3rd day on the job. The research paper was new to me and I don’t want to produce a copy-paste job just to submit it. I had to digest the source material first, and at least give a thoughtful summary no?
This issue has bothered me quite a bit. Her tone was not friendly during the exchange (completely over Teams chat as I was WFH). Should I clarify or clear the air with her when we next meet in office? My first impression of her is that she won’t take any feedback well. Or should I just live with it, and potentially she will do something else I deem unreasonable in the future. What should I do to continue working with her?

Perhaps the individual in question is ten or twenty years younger than you and appears to possess material items that you couldn't have attained ten or twenty years ago. As a result, you might be quick to assume that the person received a gift from someone or that it's their parents' money, and you treat them based on your perspective, which stems from a sense of scarcity. However, someone who could easily acquire similar material possessions might not perceive them in the same way, as they share a similar position in life. This is because they view the world through a different lens- ""half cup full"".
My point is that when you approach life with a perspective of ""been there, done that"" or ""I can do it, I have it,"" you'll find yourself resonating with like-minded individuals. Conversely, when you view the world with a ""half-cup empty"" lens, you'll constantly find issues with people or things around you. This perspective can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy because when your brain consistently sees things in a certain way, your thoughts can shape your actions, leading you to attract and surround yourself with similar-minded individuals.
So, the next time you're tempted to pass judgment or be overly critical, take a moment to consider your perspective. Allow space and time for the benefit of the doubt. 
This is more of a ramble, but it reflects my personal thoughts based on encounters with many such people. I hope this topic sparks some reflection and contributes to making the world a better place. Thank you.
