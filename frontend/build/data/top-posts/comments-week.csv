60673,107319,"I have huge round fat cheeks despite my slim figure. I think it's the gene. And, my crush recently mentioned that he is turned on by a small sharp jawline.
Please anyone advises me on how to get that V-line face, any natural way or recommended surgery is fine.

60667,107275,"I suspect my girlfriend is on the spectrum but very high functioning. She is nice to others and nice to me. She is pretty, hot, and dresses well. But from telling her stories about my life or discussing events, I realized she has little empathy which confuses me. Like she doesn’t really understand what other people might feel and takes very little interest. She also has a tendency to treat even romantic or social interactions as very clinical and methodological which throws me off. Even her hobbies or to do things are all from a Google list of what’s popular. It is not possible to talk to her about this because she is super sensitive to the mention of anything mental related. What are things I should be aware of or things I can do to maximize the chance of happiness in this relationship for both of us?

60666,107274,"I am in a stable long term rship or so I thought. Recently my gf said she is not sure if she wants us to be a long term thing but still wants this rship for now. This was a sudden thing. I also have no reason to believe there is someone else. She still plans dates for us and makes quite a bit of effort for us but every few days she reminds me of what she said. This is stressful for me because I do not know if each day will be the last day. How do I cope? What should I do?

60670,107281,"Just received really sad news today. The friendly and always so cheerful elderly auntie at arise and shine at the science canteen has unfortunately suffered a stroke recently and is currently recovering. She is struggling with the basic things in life such as lifting and carrying objects and may not be able to work again. The elderly uncle now struggles to maintain the shop alone. Hoping that we as an nus community can do more to help them. Even simple things such as being patient with the uncle and chatting with him and showing concern will make his day.

Midterms is worth 30% and I got 45/100. Lab reports are worth 20%, idk how well I did for it but the maximum I'll get is 16% due to missing one submission. This is my final sem and I just finished my FYP a week back.
