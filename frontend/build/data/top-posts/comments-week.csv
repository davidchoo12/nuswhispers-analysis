60980,107953,"I have graduated from NUS for a number of years now. Most of my friends/peers are now married. I cannot help but fall into this toxic mentality when I look at their social media. Going on long holidays in faraway places, driving out for dates to fancy places, in their tiny long wallet and beautiful trendy get up, 3 bedroom condo as matrimonial house. And here I am eating cup noodles and vegetable rice with my boyfriend, bringing an umbrella in my bag wherever we go because we either walk or cycle to date places. I am envious, I want to dress up and look pretty and go to fancy places too. This makes me wonder what did I do wrong to not have that kind of cushy lifestyle? I am reasonably smart and beautiful. I am earning a decent salary now and can afford my own car and rental. Back in university days there were guys interested in me and I have been in relationships before. I know I shouldnt compare but I really can't help it. Am I expecting too much?

I am 170cm in height (31 yo) and everytime I walk pass many people in crowded areas, all I notice are gals who are around my height (not much shorter, biologically shouldnt gals be shorter?) and guys who tower over me (180cm , 190cm, and higher!). It makes me question about my existence. How do I get rid of this feeling? I just feel genetics is really unfair, why did Darwin made it this way?
That being said, is it really true that the average height of guys in SG is 171cm? I think that includes all the older generation ah peks. If I only include people around my age, I think there is really no way to compare liao. Sian....

I've been staying over at her place during the weekends to spend more time with her and keep her company. But here's the thing, leh, after closely observing her these years, I realize she hardly does any housework when we're at her crib. Like, zero, nothing, sia. Now, I'm starting to have doubts whether she'll even chip in with the house chores if we settle down together, you know what I mean?
Don't get me wrong, I really love her and all, but I also don't wanna end up like the one doing all the housework, kancheong spider like that, when we get our own place. I just want to, like, share the load. How should I approach this topic with her, ah? Any advice?

He tried explaining to me that a lot of people do such things, even his friends do such things. He showed me his insta and socials chats. He might have talked to them but the chats were mostly normal unless he was trying to date them which are old chats. He admitted that it might not sit well with me but he wanted me to let him do it. He said he will stop and restrict to girls I am ok with if I dont agree with him.
On one hand, I find it extremely weird, especially when we actually meet these girls as friends. 
On the other hand, he did confess on his own. He also said that he doesnt mind sharing his social passwords if I am really afraid. He said he gets more intense feeling if he knew the person and he would be happy if I joined him too during his deeds.

No you cannot invest your way into landed property.
People who can afford a landed property have high income. The ballpark is 500k annual income with a gearing ratio of ten for a terrace of 5 million.
No investment is able to earn 8% on a consistent basis. The historical s&p is historical. 
There is no shortcut.
Most of your investment on the long term basis will be 4-6% per annum. If you got tricked into crypto or ILP then lesser. Anyway most guys that r exposed to Chinese tech suffered losses too.
No You won’t able to retire early.
You always need your day job. To earn big bucks, you need to set up your own company. But that comes with risk
If you do not want to assume high risk, then the best way is to work hard and earn a high income.

60990,107971,"Dear NUS management. I am a staff. Why are we going backwards with hybrid work arrangements. The recent circulars state we have to work on-site 4days per week and get to work off site once a week. While I know students are back in School, why can we retain the current hybrid arrangements which has proven to work? Some would want to return to office daily while some prefer more days WFH. Ultimately, we can strike a balance. Academic staff don't exactly have a fixed working hours unlike us E&A staff and so if this new policy was because of fairness, I don't think it is. My physical and mental health has improved drastically with hybrid work. I exercise most of the days I get to WFH as I can just immediately head out the moment work ends. Now with this new policy, it just seems like I've to just go back to my old unhealthy routine where I come home from work so late I can't even think of exercise or spend time with family. We have all gotten used to this routine and lifestyle. While I understand that hybrid work is not an entitlement and a privilege, this scheme has only helped both employer and employee over the years. Please kindly re-consider.

60995,107988,"What are your views on who ""should"" pay on the first date? This seems to be a hot topic and also a topic touched on in NUSWhispers numerous times before. Tldr; My view is that each person should pay for their OWN share, and neither party is responsible/obligated to pay for the other person's meal.
1. ""The guy should pay because he is a man"" - We live in a modern society where girls can earn just as much as guys, no longer in the 18th or 19th century, so why should a guy pay for the lady, who is able to earn just as much or even more than the guy can? Are girls to be treated as equals? Or an inferior gender such that they can't afford their own meal?
2. ""Whoever invites the other person should pay"" - I notice that many girls support this view, but yet we all know that guys usually ask the girl out first, and girls usually expect and hope for the guy to make the first move to ask the girl out first. And even when the girl likes the guy, girls would rather ""make it very obvious that they're interested so that the guy will take the hint and ask her out"", instead of asking the guy out themselves. If that's the case, this is as good as saying ""the guy should pay"".
I have another perspective to share with regards to this view. I think whoever invites the other person out for a first date is giving an invitation for both people to MUTUALLY agree that they would like to have a first meetup/date to get to know each other better, and NOT that the person who invites is going to treat a meal or anything. Think about it this way, when you tell your friends ""do you want to eat chicken rice together later?"", we instinctively know it is an invitation for both you and your friend to spend quality time together, and instinctively know that each of you are paying for your own share. This is how it should be when you invite someone out for a first date for both of you to mutually get to know each other.
3. ""I put on makeup for the date, and makeup is expensive, so if I dress up, of course he should pay for the meal"" - Does that mean that if I as the guy, buy a very expensive nice-looking outfit and wear it to the first date, you are obligated to treat me to a very expensive meal since I wore such an exquisite outfit for you to see? Your decision to put on makeup or dress up nicely or not is entirely your call and dependent on how you wish to present yourself, no guy is obligated/responsible to pay (indirectly by paying for your meal) for your fashion/makeup choices.
4. ""Guys don't have to pay, but if he pays it's bonus points"" - What some girls actually mean when you expand on this is, ""if he pays for my meal, yes it is bonus points for him, but if he doesn't, I would get turned off and deduct points and not meet again"". If you get turned off if a guy does not pay, it means your view is not for both to fairly pay their share, but for the guy to pay for your meal.
5. ""I'm a traditional woman and so I expect the man to pay just like old times"" - If you put these kind of old traditional expectations on a man, then does that mean that in return, you would hold yourself to traditional standards and expectations of a woman as well? Things such as having to obey and serve your husband/boyfriend/date, to cook and clean, to focus on taking care of kids, and not to be going out to work? Because if you expect a man to be traditional and ""provide"", then you should be giving what you wish to get as well. Realistically, which woman today actually act the ""traditional woman"" part despite calling themselves traditional? They just expect that from guys but yet don't hold themselves to the same ""traditional"" standards.
Why I think we should (man or woman) pay for our own share on a first date: It is SIMPLY fair, and it comes from a perspective where we both are equal individuals and view each other as such. The man or woman does not need to pay (for the other person's meal) in order to have an opportunity to get to know the other person, it is simply based upon mutual respect for each other that both are mutually agreeing to meet and explore where things goes romantically. Whether or not anyone (men or woman) treats the other person to a meal or drink, is not a ""SHOULD"", but a ""WANT"", if it happens.
Also, a first date is for both people to see if there is a connection, meaning a second date is still up for consideration and not confirmed for both people. Girls know this and yet if they still expect the guy to pay for their meal, it just reflects upon how all they're thinking is about themselves, and not being considerate for the guy and his money, definitely selfish, and a red flag. Some girls also just use guys as a ""free meal ticket"".
I hold myself to the same standards that I listed out above. Meaning, I DO NOT expect any woman to pay for my meals even if they ask me out. I do not expect girls to pay for me if I happen to wear an expensive outfit (this goes without saying but yeah). I respect the girl's time and do not feel entitled to her money.
I think that expecting the other person to pay for your meal (whether you're a man or woman), is an entitled attitude, and a red flag that people should avoid when finding a partner. As a guy, it seems like girls who have bad upbringing and bad peer influence are more likely to have this entitled attitude. The ""yes queen, you deserve better, you deserve more"" kind of messages that girls give each other, seem to feed into this whole delusional and entitled mentality that some girls have.
What are your views on this?

60977,107944,"I became acquainted with FM over a decade ago while we were both students. Our close friendship blossomed due to the nature of our program, leading us to spend a significant amount of time together. We shared our hobbies, discussed life plans, perspectives on the world, and much more. Meeting for meals and spending weekends together became routine, often just the two of us, with little or no interaction and knowledge of others around us.
I held a postive feeling for her, yet our relationship never crossed into romantic territory, and there was no trace of ambiguity. Could it be that we were simply pure friends with no romantic chemistry? Was it because of our differing backgrounds and varying aspirations and expectations for life partners? I never had the opportunity to directly ask her if she felt the same. However, I vividly remember a humorous incident where I played the role of an advisor to help her get closer to a boy she liked.
Graduation eventually arrived, causing our lives to drift apart gradually. We pursued our separate careers, got married, and started families. With each milestone, our distance grew wider. Before I knew it, years had passed since we last communicated.
Recently, I received the shocking news of her passing. I was left in a state of stunned disbelief, unsure of how to react.
The loss of someone who used to be so close to me left me deeply saddened, yet I found myself unable to shed tears. I regret not staying in touch with her as much as I could have, and now, there's no chance to amend that.
I was taken aback by the fragility of life and how everything that seemed perfect could be abruptly taken away by nature, often with little warning. However, I realize there's nothing I can do to change this reality.
These emotions have become a heavy burden on my chest, and I'm unable to express them. Perhaps sharing anonymously is the only way.
I implore you to cherish those around you while you still can. For those who are on your mind but not by your side, reach out to them now and maintain contact as much as possible. For those you hold grudges against, try to let go and forgive.
Life is fleeting, and if you're fortunate, you may reach your 80s. There's not much time to wait for someone else to pick up the phone, to hesitate about making the first move, or to guess instead of asking for answers.
