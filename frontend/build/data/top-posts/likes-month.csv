To the op with a gambling boyfriend of 2.5 years.
I used to have a boyfriend who gambles. I left him after 2 years as I could no longer see a future with him. And the reason was not just about the gambling but also a collective pattern in his behavior that made me decided to leave him.
He is with friends with people who gamble. His family members also gamble. They moved houses a few times because of loan sharks. He told me he hated his dad for gambling and making his mum suffer and being forced to work 2,3 jobs to keep the house running. They gamble in hundreds and thousands per session depending on the game. He has a bad temper but has never flared up at me in those 2 years of being together but I have seen him get angry at his friends and family and it was an ugly side of him. I wouldn't dare to make him angry. He uses and abuse his weaker friends and sucks up to friends who are more powerful and richer than him. I hated the way he treated service staff. He uses index and middle finger to pass card or cash. Soon I realised his entire family member does that so it's a learnt behavior.
I spent hours and hours watching him play. Some days he lose some days he win. He plays with people he hate and also with people he like. Sometimes someone will accuse him of owing them $500 or $1000 when he don't even remember and he would just pay even when his bank account is left with $50. When he wins he splurge and treats everyone for a meal or drinks. He gambles not only the weekends but also during weekdays after work. Sometimes I pay for meals, dates and transport when he is broke. He has never tried to borrow money from me and I've never offered.
One day I just had a revelation. I want out and I started to spend less and less time with him. I got no balls to tell him to his face that I do not want to become his mother and suffer. The week when we broke up he took a while to realise why I left without me saying the truth. He told me he quit gambling but I never believed him.
This happened in my early 20s. 2.5 years is enough of a time for you to decide if your bf is worth sticking around for. From the way you talked about him, I think you know the answer already. Gambling aside, you would not want a gaslighting husband. Good times everyone can be nice. Don't be blinded. Look at everything as a whole. What matters more is during the hard and bad times, what does he choose to do?
Your future children can't choose who their father is but you can. Choose wisely.

60036,105979,"My boyfriend in Meta got layoff.
I was promised a great future with him when he secured a job at Meta at SV. We were in talks about whether I shld join him in California and live the American dream. However all this came to a halt when he phoned me last night sayin that he's one of the 11% that got laid off. A part of me died. He told me that he'll look for another job in the states so that we can resume our plan. Given the current economy, I doubt that is possible and I suggested him to return to SG which he outright refuse. He claimed that SG is not as prestigious as SV in terms of tech which I beg to differ as beggars can't be chooser. I'm at my wits end now and I'm unsure of what to do. He's childish and immature. The only things he loves to talk about is tech stuff which I find unromantic and boring. He stan Muck Zuckerberg & the meta-verse so much that I find him delusional. I am contemplating on moving on from this relationship and finding someone who's more realistic.
Call me a good digger if you want but I can no longer see how the relationship can survive just like how I'm misled by him into thinking that terra luna would survive.

60022,105945,"people think body dysmorphia can only happen to females, but it can happen to males too
from 2018-2021 , i was super focused on my body. i looked at the fitness youtube video and i trained 5-6 times a week at the gym except for circuit breaker. my six packs became very well defined. even my calves are great. i prob can give my singapore a run for his money. but i had to have a clean diet and gave up my social life. the hardest part was food
breakfast - plain oats, 4 hardboiled eggs, 2 tomatoes for breakfast
lunch - i would pack food to school. few scoops brown rice + generous amount of steamed chicken, cucumber slices
dinner - few scoops brown rice again, generous amount steamed chicken, 1 fruit
supper - 2 blocks of plain tofu, another tomato
but deep down i wasnt happy. i craved for hotpot. i craved for midnight prata/thai food supper session with my friends
so i gave in. and i joined my friends for supper and eight month later i am a much happier person. i still can do 15 standard pull ups (full elbow extension, and chin clear the bar by 1 inch at least). my body fat has gone to a more normal 20%. i no longer feel hunger pangs. i gained 8kg. but every ounce is worth it.
always remember looks is external. happiness the most important. plus i feel more energetic now
dont let the instagram models (males or females) cloud your judgement. you have a choice. you do not have to look like them. YOU can choose a happy life

59996,105900,"Lost a friend during the Itaewon Incident. She was a nice friend to talk to.. really very extroverted. Her smiles and laugher never fails to cheer me up whenever we video called each other. She was really gone too soon. Her hopes and dreams to become what she want in the future crashed that night. When I saw the video of someone doing the cpr of the costume she wore, i knew she was gone. Whenever i was upset, she will be the person who always cheer me up and gives me advices whenever i need them. There were too many things i wanted to say to her. Even a simple ""Thank you for listening to me "" she couldn't hear it right now. We were supposed to meet next year once i finished my school for my graduation trip. Now i only could silently pray she could come back to my dreams. Or maybe when i look up at the skies finding the brightest star, that would be her shining telling me that she is fine up there. Lives were all gone too soon, so please cherish everyone and tell them how much you love them today before it's too late...

60037,105962,"To all the boomers out there on this platform: a very big f off.
You can't justify toxic behaviour from an elder simply because he/she is an elder - especially parents. Like seriously, what the fuck is wrong with y'alls boomer brains? My parents provided for me when I'm young therefore they have the rights to be toxic towards me? Controlling? Gaslighting? Abusive?
Like c'mon, as parents you're f-ing bringing your kid into this world, you should be guiding them to a path that's BEST SUITED for them, letting them EXPLORE what they want to do with their life. Your kid has his/her own life, and their life is not yours. You've already had your own life to lead, don't try to f-ing lead your unfulfilled dreams through your kid.
Seriously, I can't stand these conservative mindsets. ""Oh I put food on the table for you hence I get to dictate your life."" Uh bitch, a big fat no? That's a basic need and pretty much a big damn consequence of wanting to have a child, not an entitlement for you to dictate your child's life.

60001,105910,"This is bothering me for a while. A while ago I was doing internship in a bank, there I met a NUS senior of my age. She's 23 just like me, I kinda have a crush on her. The thing is she has a bf who works in the same bank and she is getting married this year. The BF is 36 years old and is a senior banker. They both been dating for 2 years, when she did the same internship.
I found out later that this phenomenon is common in the bank, with many dudes around 10-15 years older than their spouse. Another intern(21) also dated one dude 9 years older because he has a car, condo and a 100k salary package.
At this rate all the good ones are getting hunted by all these rich old man. To the girls, Isn't it really disgusting to date someone almost 1.5 times older than you?
Recently I shared this thought with a friend, and she told me that if she was could find a 100k per annum dude with a car and condo, she'd marry him no matter how bad he is. Worst come to worst she could just divorce and ask for alimony.
What is this world coming to? Maybe I should go for dudes instead.

60096,106088,"My mum is living her ambitions through me and its suffocating.
I'm a top student with a narcissistic mother. My mother married my dad when she was 20 and never had to work her entire life. She dropped out of school mid way after she met my dad who's much older and was married to him within a year and had me. My father is the one with the brains. He was the top student during his youth.
Even though my mother never worked her whole life, she didn't take care of me when I was young. I was sent to my grandparents home during the weekdays and I only went home during weekends till I started school. Even though I did well in my studies, I was forced to take tuition for every subject. My dad initially objected but caved in after my mum persisted. As time grew, I didn't mind as it's a good reason to be away from home and away from my mum.
My mother is constantly bragging about my achievements to anyone who is willing to hear and its embarrassing. Even though I'm a top student, we come from a humble background and I lived in the same place since the day I was born. It's hard enough to be looked down by the other rich students even though I'm doing better in terms of grades. My mother would embarrass me by trying to talk about me to people who didn't even ask about me. Like my cousin is only in P1 so we have a huge age gap, she would brag about how I was when I was P1 and I'm already past 20. I don't remember what achievement awards that I've collected over the years but she can name them out as though people cared. She is constantly making excuses to why she can't work because of me. As a result of her obnoxious behavior, we are not close to relatives. I am also not close to my cousins as my mum constantly reminded me that they are average students and I should only mix with people who are similar like me. I admit I feel superior to them as I'm a single child and have more attention and money spent on me compared to my less privileged cousins who had to settle for diplomas.
I can't be friends with people she don't approve of. I am not allowed to date. She knows nothing about the courses I'm doing and would always try to lecture me when she knows nothing. I'm not allowed to dress what I like. I'm not allowed a lot of things. She checks my phone whenever she likes and reads my texts. When I'm relaxing she would make snide comments if she think I've rested for too long. I've given up having a social life because she will follow me wherever I go. As a housewife she has no friends and doesn't even cook. My father and I are the ones doing the household chores most of the time. I really wish she find a part time job or meet a friend and get off my back.
I'm studying for my degree now and she would talk about her expectations of my future salary and how much she is going to get from me for all the sacrifices she ""made"" for me. Internally, I really hated the thought of taking over the role of my father to take care of her. She play games on her phone all the time. For a self disciplined person, I really dislike how she's wasting her time too.
I appreciate my father more than my mother because he was the one who did all the financial planning for my studies while my mum was only interested in when is her next holiday and when is her next branded bag coming in. I have no plans to enable my mother next time. I can't wait to graduate, move out and start my own life. Am I being unfilial?

60010,105928,"I'm a NUS alumni and current a Senior Manager for one of the biggest IT Firm. Just last week I met guys from my batch, most of whom were hiring manager in reputable firms.
In our conversation we realize we have the same serious issue, and our solutions to that is exactly the same, but we're still not getting results.
We have a talent shortage. Our solution is high salary, head hunt and expand to non-CS people.
What we found out were the same, most of the fresh grads are not qualified for the job, cannot perform under stress, fail deadlines and leaves between 6 - 12 months. It isn't that we didn't vet our candidates, we have rigorous interviewing process, with in-person coding test, personality test and a 60-90k package for fresh grad, much more if you've xp. On average only less than 10% manage to go into final round of interview. Yet 80% leaves within the first year without producing any good results, and those who stayed on would have another offer lined up by their third year. University and GPA are poor indicator, in fact I had xp with a few poly student out performing NUS FCH but leaves due to better offer, our company refuse to pay non-degree holder more than 50k per annum. Some of the wiser among readers can guess my firm.
We also realize that many younger candidates, <5 yrs xp, has an average of 1 yr tenure but virtually same as fresh grads. Despite that many still demand high salary, we think GES is partly to blame. Interestingly, we also realized that a particular group of them were also willing to accept a much lower package for a less demanding role, I guess their xp have traumatize them. Tracking our ex employees, we realize that about half of those who couldn't handle it change to a different field and a sizable portion took easier roles.
Those >5 yrs xp is a huge mix bag but many have unrealistic expectation due to how high we're offering fresh grads. The most Inspirational case I came across was this one candidate who asked for a 70% jump from his previous salary because a particular ecommerce was listing high salary for fresh grads and he feels that he should get 20% on top of that, he barely pass our coding test with his 4 years xp. I do not blame him, the market is broken because there is just not enough talent.
To put my point across, in my company we track the progress and output of every SWE. Last year, 53% of the productivity is created by 16% of the team. All of them are in the senior or lead position, all of them are overwork and burned out. Those <5yrs xp represent 58 % of the team but only accounts for 27% productivity with one unicorn responsible for ~3% productivity. To be fair, about half of them were hired last years, they account for 7% productivity.
I don't know what's wrong with our education system, but we aren't creating talents or hard workers.

Theres so much more that our Regulators have failed TERRIBLY at when it comes to financial regulations and all they can do now is just shirk any form of responsibility and say it is not their fault.

60080,106054,"I am in my early 30s. Went for a career switch programme 5 years ago. Graduated 2 years later. Got married, got a house, gave birth to a lovable daughter. Wanted to further my studies for a degree a year after diploma but I got pregnant instead. So waited until she’s 2(now), so basically my cert is 3 years old already.
I told my husband I wanted to study again. He was hesitant at first but he agreed. I told him I was accepted in NUS and my classes are in the evening, studying part time while working full time. After a month of school, he expressed that he cannot handle the stress of being with our daughter alone. He needs me around and he’d rather I stopped schooling until she’s older. I have 3 years of school. Only went through 1 freaking semester.
I told him I can’t quit, I just started and it’s not as if I have not been helping out. During the days I have zoom classes, I will do it while my daughter is on my lap. The only days he has to handle her alone is when I am on campus and it’s 3 hours of school. Husband is easily stressed as a person. He has anxiety attacks whenever I am not around, super introvert person while I am a total opposite.
I am upset that he is not fully on board with me schooling again. He told me if we do not have a daughter, he will be happy for me but now, he can’t and I can’t be mad at him for expressing himself cause that is what he feels and he wants to share it with me. I am conflicted ????

What surplas are they talking about when they are barring people from applying (singles below 35, non-traditional family units etc)? If a BTO project is really under subscribed, just release the extras to those you don't allow to get a BTO ah. I'm sure it will be snapped up.

60074,106043,"I first met him when we were 13yo in sec sch and we both had what everyone calls it puppy love for each other but we never exactly got together. We remained friends throughout our sec sch phase and we went on a short grad trip with a whole bunch of our classmates.
It was during the grad trip that the feelings for him resurfaced again and I could feel that there was some kind of sexual tension seeing how we both wanted to be close to each other but we didn’t cos we were both afraid of our friends “disturbing” us. Nothing happened during the trip other than that invisible pull between us. We texted here and there after the trip but had never addressed what we felt towards each other.
We moved on to different tertiary schools, drifted off from each other and he subsequently found a girlfriend. They seemed really cute together and I was genuinely happy for him. I guess because we never really started anything, I didn’t felt heartbroken or anything of that sort about it.
Then one day we bumped into each other and started texting again. It was friendly texts catching up with our lives and no flirting was involved. We met up one night and somehow ended up at his place because I needed the restroom. We were watching some stuff on my phone when he started to snatch my phone away and like how dramas usually go, we ended up tickling and hugging each other (cringey af, I know). It started to get really late and I was sleepy. I never had the intention of sleeping over when we met up for the night but ended up sleeping over anyway. Nothing sexual happened that night other than hugging each other to sleep.
I went home the next morning and we met up again that night. He was the one that requested to meet up again but of course the stupid me didn’t reject his request. We ate out and again went over to his place. I spent the night again and this time we had sex with each other. I went home the next morning and we didn’t meet for the next few days because he had some orientation camp stuff to attend to for a few days.
He said he missed me and all those nonsense shit. But he posted an Instagram post thanking his girlfriend for being the sweetest human being by his side. And that’s when I realized how stupid I had been to allow my feelings to take control instead of my brain.
Yes, I knew he hadn’t broken up with his girlfriend when I stayed over the first night. He told me they were in a Cold War and the situation wasn’t great. The naive me believed him. I should have known better.
I stopped replying him when his IG post went out and he texted me saying he can’t bear to break his girlfriend heart and seeing her cry is the worst thing ever. honestly, I wasn’t expecting him to break up with the girlfriend and be with me. I just didn’t expect that he was such a douchebag and never once apologized for leading me on. I eventually sent him a text about my feelings, how I didn’t meant to be the third party, how messed up we had been, how I realized that I have always been in love with him since 13 and he had always been my kryptonite. He didn’t acknowledge my feelings and I didn’t reply anything to him after that.
Few months later, I posted a Snapchat on feeling stressed about school work and he replied my snap to ask me to go over his place. I was completely dumbfounded and speechless by this guy. How could he be so… fucked up? I ignored his snap and we never talked since then.
It has been at least 5 years since this incident and it took me a long time to fully get over the guilt of sleeping with an attached guy and I also became paranoid with my partners on whether they will be secretly be sleeping with another girl without me knowing. I guess you can call that karma but I will fully accept that fate if it happened to me because I know I deserved it for what I’ve done.
For that guy, he has married that girlfriend that he cheated on with me. I don’t know if he has ever told her the truth or if he had slept with other girls in between. I know I am an awful person but I hope that his wife will someday cheat on him and leave him at his lowest. Or that he may never have kids, ever. Guys like him shouldn’t reproduce. And maybe girls like me shouldn’t too. Oh well.
Sorry for lousy grammar and the long rant. Just needed to get this out and finally close this chapter in my life.

60002,105913,"[Follow-up for #105869] Hello everyone, I'm the fresh grad guy that was stuck between the 90k and 70k job. Even though i know most of you dont care [LOL each man for his own!] I thought I would share my decision and thought process, in case anyone ever get stuck in my position too. Many thanks to Prof Ben and others who responded thoughtfully!
Ultimately I decided the 90k Job [Sorry Prof Ben! NGL, Your comment made me hesitate greatly. I almost chose the 70k option when I think back about your comment! And yes you've rightfully pointed out that im part of the 80% and not one of those chiongters. Met some of them during CS days. Its hard to imagine how to really catch up]
Like some people have rightfully guessed, the 70k job is related to consulting. Without delving too deep [yall are too good at stalking], it was in a role which required frequent travels but not technical. I always thought it would be fun to do different projects as well [less monotonous bro]! Frankly the starting pay wasn't too bad [~5.5k per month w bonuses]. More then enough for my current lifestyle. With consulting job comes certain skillset [Idk, smoking skills? HAHA] and I thought IR skills was definitely transferable [in case I want to continue working on IR related jobs]. Of course, I nv worked a day in consulting before and I heard the life is pretty shit and intense. But still if I don't try, I would never know right? Most importantly, this role does not always present itself (dont ask me how i got through the interviews. Sometimes you get luck). If not now, then when? What if I never get a similar opportunity anymore? My CS Job won't be able to help me travel around even!
But what pushed me to decide the 90k Job is as follows:
1. If my early career does not define my life, why not take this chance to earn cash and improve on my technical skills [which is truly, indispensable in today's digital age]
2. With the cash [and ETF investment. Lord praise the US markets. Ok but for real, hope the world becomes a better place so everyone flourishes and my etf flourishes as well] I can build up my ""Fk you"" money. And at the same time, build up on my resume so I am wanted *everywhere*
3. Am I giving up on my dream job? Hell no! I will simply postpone it! I am early in my career! If i can afford to take a risk on possible setbacks from the consulting job, i can equally take the risk of giving up this opportunity and HUNT for one next time.
Yes opportunities doesn't always come. The consulting role I mentioned isn't always available. And they may not even consider me next time. But the onus is on me then. I will improve. Be better. And be on a consistent look out. That's why I decided to give up on this opportunity, and look for another one who would be willing to compensate similarly in the future. Maybe as a fresh grad, 70k was all they were willing to pay. But what if i came back with more experience? Make myself worth that much in the future!
So with that, goodbye dream consulting job [for now]. I'll be back. And my final advice for those who may be in a similar crossroad. As everyone said, there's no right choice! There are only different perspectives. For me, I was only willing to give up my dream job because someone reminded me this : ""This won't be the only job that you get to travel. You're not giving up on this opportunity, you're giving yourself a chance to seek for a better opportunity. The world is large. If you truly want it again, you can and should hunt for it again. Get some cash ready to prepare for your next fight"". So my final advice is as follows: ""Don't give up on an opportunity because it's not the ""best"". There would always be a better one. But definitely don't accept a deal that is objectively worse off"".
That's all folk. It's a long WoT. Perhaps a way for me to convince myself I made the right choice. But hey who cares. I will be buying my S22 Ultra for the ITZY concert now! Thanks for reading. Great luck to all your careers my fellow students!

60057,106014,"Many people seem to think that CS is a very good course. I am sorry to say that CS is not a good course at all.
CS has always been shunned by students in the past (before 2014). And 1 of the very main reasons is because CS is at the cutting edge of technology and it gets obsolete very quickly. Ageism is very true in the software industry.
As a GP or lawyer, your value increases substantially over the years and your salary/earning power also increase significantly over time. As a SWE, you start off with relatively high salary but it stagnates quickly as your value goes down over the years as the tech stacks you know gets obsolete.
To prospective students, please think carefully before you join CS!

59990,105888,"I noticed that so many people don’t study, but do better than the honest ones who study. So many people use emotions instead of logic, but somehow score very well academically. So many people are far from the logic-loving robots without feelings, but end up doing so much better than those who use logic to replace feelings and study all the time. I always ask myself, how did they get there?
That one genius in my class who gets 100 or 99 for every single maths test never studies at all. When we are studying, she is watching movies on YouTube before exams. She’s the only one who cried when the teacher showed us a 911 documentary featuring orphans. She has feelings and empathy. She has EQ. And she still has the highest grades ever.
The other friend from secondary school until JC is ALWAYS shopping for makeup, clothes and accessories after school. She spends her weekends cafe hopping with her boyfriend. She said out loud once, “it’s really not the more you study the better you do you know. You can study hard but still don’t do well.” She got 8 distinctions (yes she took h3) for a levels, and 93/100 for her maths promos when 75% of the cohort failed. And yes, she spends 300 dollars a day just shopping at orchard, while I was using logic to replace emotions, and telling myself to be thrifty because it’s a “virtue”. She doesn’t. It’s feelings that drive her to spend on things she doesn’t need. Yet who scores higher? Her.
My 2 acquaintances from JC are a textbook example of MIRACLE. They spend their Jc Life dating, instead of focusing on studies. It’s again, emotions over logic. Them two can never save a single cent of allowance because as soon as they receive it, they spend it all on manicures and shopping sprees. Their wardrobes are jam packed with unnecessary stuff bought on IMPULSE, NOT LOGIC. and guess what? Both got straight A for A levels, and FIRST CLASS HONOURS in university. And they are in the science stream, which emphasises on critical and logical thinking. If they score well for literature or art I’m not surprised because it’s about people and feelings. But……How do they follow their heart and not their head, but do so much better in SCIENCE than us who study all the time?
And my best friends cousin defied everything we learn since young about a “good model student”. She clubs, drinks and vapes every week. She has about 4 tattoos and multiple piercings. She never, ever, uses logic to replace emotions to force herself to study. She follows her heart. She has EQ, the stuff that makes you love and connect with people. She had 4 boyfriends and 3 friends with benefits. And she got into deans list 5 times already, first class honours as well.
I’m quite sure there are a lot of people who just spend their time not studying. When we are studying, they are watching movies. When we are revising, they are shopping. When we logically listen to what primary school Teachers say about “hardwork” and “ thrift “, they are spending all their money without logic, easily filling their hands with shopping bag after shopping bag. When we are staying at home alone to study using IQ, they are connecting with boyfriends , dating, having sex, and exercising EQ.
How then do all these people get straight A including general paper(not Many can get A for that) , and A for science based subjects. Where did the first class honours come out from then?
I realised sadly that academic results are INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL to how much you honestly work hard.

60014,105934,"Am I being an asshole for not wanting to have any relation to my siblings?
So a little a bit of context:
I was never your typical book smart student. My grades in primary school through secondary school was not great. I got 168 for my PSLE and went to NA in a neighbourhood sec sch and for this, I was constantly bullied by my siblings, yes.. my very own siblings, for having poor grades. They constantly called me names such as the 168 girl, NA retard etc. All in front of my parents. What pisses me off and scars me till this day is that my parents did NOTHING about this. All they said is ""Transfer to Express stream and they will stop."" I honestly still hold a grudge against my parents for not doing anything about the bullying I faced from my siblings.
Of course when I stepped into Secondary school, my self confidence plummeted like mad. I became very withdrawn and I hated socialising with people. Went to poly, started doing better.... average GPA of 3.4, went to Uni and now doing my postgrad.
A series of events happened over the past few years with my siblings and my parents have been trying to persuade me to step in to talk to them and advice them. However, I refuse to. I do not want to have any relation to them. Neither do I want to have anything to do with them. Over the years I was met only with hostility and they did jack shit to help me so now I am thinking, why should I?
So, am I being an asshole/petty for not wanting to have any relation to them?

60056,106012,"A random girl added me on insta recently & started sliding into my DMs. I chatted with her & she asked for my number to move the convo to WA. On WA, we chatted for a few day. She was quite flirtatious & always initiated the convo. So I thought she was interested in me.
But one day, she asked me to help her with her part-time lobang which is basically an e-commerce scam which I was familiar with (as I fell for this exact scam b4 by a different person). So I said no, then she became verbally abusive, forceful & demanding, trying to pressure me to do this so called lobang. For days I held my ground & said no, but continued to casually talk to her as I was bored anyways & needed something entertaining to see me through my busy work week (my job is pretty stressful IDK why). From this moment on, I mostly initiated the convo for fun. For days she also tried to convince me to do this “lobang” but to no avail. Eventually, she got very tired & did not want to talk to me anymore. So before I ended the comms, I asked her why she was doing this scam & she told me something that got me pondering.
She said she wanted a better life. Then I tried to be more sympathetic & said that Singapore is a hard place to live because it is very expensive. She kind of agreed by saying that she does this because she needed to survive & cope with life’s pressure. Since I remember that the year end festive season is coming, so I offered to give her an Ang Bao as an early present. But she refused & wanted me to do the scam instead bcos she preferred “career progression”. I was shocked bcos this so called career of hers is illegal to begin with. So I tried to probe further but to no avail. Perhaps she realised that it was a waste of time talking to me, so we agreed to eventually stopped the convo.
So my question is this, what should I do?Should I have reported her or helped her? And if I were to help her, how should I do it ? Also, are there online scammers out there facing the same struggles as her? Given that the economy is gloomy & uncertain & inflation is a huge burden for many …

People say the change is the only constant, they are wrong, everything in life changes, but there's one constant constant, which is ""death"".

Give your quality time to those who matters, they will be the ones who remember when you are gone, not the corporation you worked at, your school, your car, your house or your bank account.
If it's needed, quit your job, quit your school, don't be afraid to try again, because those who matter don't mind and those who mind don't matter, they will always be around to support your decision because they know who you really are.

Idk its normal that your partner can just go gamble and leave you alone on the weekend.
One time he was feeling upset and actually told me he wanted to go play poker. But I’m like if you’re upset, you can talk to me and we can spend time together. If you’re upset, but you’re thinking of gambling rather than coming to me, am I even important?
Idk what to do as I’m too comfortable with him. I stay at his place most of the time. He would sometimes ask me to go together, but i really dislike people who gamble. So I don’t usually follow. The worst part is, he kinda got to know those other poker players through me. Kinda regret intro-ing them in the first place.
I feel like he's getting addicted but whenever I mention this, he would deny it and gaslight me. He doesn't like the word ‘addicted’. Last time he would gamble only during cny, but now, saying ""Oh festive season. Once in a while."" Now - idk what to say.

60052,106001,"Hi everyone, I am the OP of https://www.NUSWhispers.com/confession/105979.
Unsurprisingly, many bash me for being a gold-digger, whereas some support my sentiment – I thank you for that. Given the economic turbulence, I am deeply concerned about our financial state, and I can’t help but worry about our future.
A bit of context about myself: I grew up in a poor household where my family had difficulty making ends meet. My dad is a compulsive gambler, whereas my mom is a shm. My dad would rack up tons of debt each month and expect others to pay it off for him. Living with him was a complete nightmare. I was taught the value of money at a very young age. I had scrimped and saved to clear the pilling debt and ensure that we had the money for food. I see entering university as an option to escape this situation and be free of financial woes. During my time at the university, my friends would travel overseas and speak fervently about their experiences. I am immensely jealous of their financial ability and had difficulty dealing with such emotions. While I am busily hustling with multiple part-time jobs in SG, I am constantly reminded of how my life would turn out if I were to be born into privilege and be able to do whatever I want.
Life wasn’t entirely unfair for me. I had two suitors back in uni. One of them was from biz whom I met in an orientation camp. We had good chemistry. He is quick-witted and good with words. However, silly me decided not to see my feeling till the end as I am still acclimatizing to the new uni environment, which I find difficult due to imposter syndrome. Then there comes the tech boom. Rumour has it that computing students commanded a high starting pay upon graduation. I took up basic computing mods for fun, hoping to make new connections. I instantly regretted it. Programming mods are easily some of the toughest courses in uni, and I had to stay up late and rely on my peers for assistance. I recalled approaching the prof if there were any “shortcuts” to succeed in this field without going through this grueling learning process, to which he cheekily replied: “Just go get a CS boyfriend, lah.” Despite the ridicule, I took his advice, and true enough, I met my current boyfriend in an organized session for CS student to network and find love.
I must admit, my boyfriend is not the most handsome and charismatic among the guys I encountered. His earning potential mainly attracts me. He stan his prof so much and views him as a supreme sorcerer. He is heavily influenced by his view and is bullish on the prospect of FAANG. He would coerce me into investing my hard-earned money into FAANG and some unknown cryptos with assurances that they would yield positive returns. His obsession with FAANG eventually earned him a spot in FB at SV, which I am happy for him. He then moved to California to pursue the opportunity while I stayed in SG, hoping I would join him as soon as he had settled. The first few years were rosy as our careers soared and our investments peaked. It was not long before all good things came to an end.
Fast forward to today, I received news that he was let go with no concrete plans moving forward. He is on a work visa and will have to return to SG if he cannot secure another job there. His refusal to return home and work in SG leaves our future uncertain. I suspect my income alone cannot sustain us for long s as I am drawing a mediocre wage. Despite the circumstance, he remained optimistic and unbothered about our financial position. Last I checked, he solicited money from his relatives along with his severance to short cryptos to turn the tide. He promised them he would double their money in a couple of days which I find hard to believe.
It is difficult to fathom how someone smart enough to enter FAANG has landed himself in such a plight, completely derailed and out-of-touch with the world. I am now left with a delusional boyfriend and a broken portfolio down by 70%. Due to my constant struggle with money, I felt as if I had reverted to square one and began to doubt my decision to choose my boyfriend over the biz chap from orientation. I would sometime browse his Instagram to see how he was doing. Seeing how he is often on vacation with his wife and making luxurious purchases made me green with envy as it is the kind of life that I have been working so hard for all this while.
I understand it is a long post, and I ultimately only have myself to blame for how things have transpired the past couple of days - just wanna rant and seek some comfort in these trying times.

He has always been the perfect gentleman to me, and we talk about having a future together. He likes to spoil me E.g. taking me out to expensive restaurants for special occasions (almost 4 digit bill). One time, I went on a solo trip (his company had an emergency) and he upgraded my flight to first class as he felt bad for ditching me. After he got a promotion at work, he gave me a big angpao to thank me for being a supportive gf. When I had a really bad sore throat from COVID, he bought me a few jars of high grade manuka honey. When I saw the invoice I almost got a heart attack!
As I come from a relatively humble background, I am unused to such spending habits- growing up, even buying fresh milk at NTUC was considered a luxury.
I feel particularly uncomfortable as my salary is significantly lower than his and I can’t afford to reciprocate at the same level. My parents always taught me ”拿人手短，吃人嘴软” (if you spend someone else’s money, you’re indebted to them) and never accepted expensive gifts. One of my more cynical (and socialist) friends thinks he just likes showing off his bourgeoisie tastes and that he’s basically buying me like I’m a product by throwing money at me.
I’m conflicted as to how I feel about this. On the one hand, I feel very lucky to have such a doting boyfriend who would be considered a catch by many. Although he’s not super handsome by conventional standards, he is quite fit and dresses well. He also has a great sense of humour and is very popular with colleagues and friends. I think he would make a great father to our future children. I can’t lie and say that i don’t enjoy being pampered once in a while, and I also can’t fault him for his spending habits as he has more than enough savings and revenue streams for a financially comfortable future. However, I also can’t get rid of the nagging sense of guilt at the back of my mind everytime he splurges on me, especially given our vast contrast in earning power. Is it problematic for me to continue accepting his gifts while giving much less in return?

60073,106041,"I’m a 2nd gen Singaporean but both my parents are Filipino. There’s this pinoy from my lecture. Looks 7.5/10 a bit on the short side but average height for pinoy, character idk but he’s quite strange for Singapore standards..? Back home it’s normal but we have cultural differences. The first time we met was during lecture. He sat beside me and greeted me hi in Tagalog and I was quite shocked because I don’t look pinoy but we became friends immediately
He always wears singlet, shorts and slippers to school which to me is ok because it’s comfortable especially in hot weather. We studied together for a few weeks and also go out shopping then I realised that he wears singlet and slippers everywhere. Like really everywhere. Even when we go to nicer place he will wear slippers. Also I noticed that she shaves his legs and armpit and when I ask him he said it’s cooling. One time he ask me go out and eat and he book a nice restaurant and I told him that there’s dress code. Smart casual I think. So means jeans and covered shoes. He showed up in singlet, jacket, shorts and slippers. The waitress at first don’t let us inside but he told her that it’s our anniversary so she let us in after talking to her manager.
I joked to him about it because it was a bit awkward but he laughed it off and said “maybe we should kiss when the waitress comes so she’ll think we’re together”. I am a bit uncomfortable with it but he’s always joking all the time so I don’t know if he’s serious.
Afterwards we went to MBS and walked along the river. At first I thought he see me as friend but he started talking about love and how he wants security so I interrupted him and told him that I’m in a relationship and my gf will not be happy if she finds out. He ask me where my gf and I said in the Philippines and he said “ok what, not like she’ll know” and I said to him “bro I’m not gay” and he said “we can try new things together” I was a bit scared because he’s quite big so I just told him again that I’m not a gay and he said ok. Afterwards I went home and he sent me a super long message about how he thinks I’m cute and he felt that I lie to him by leading him on and being nice to him. He also said that if I wanted to try new things with him just let him know and he’s always waiting for me. I don’t know how to respond because I’m definitely not cute I have a beard and I’m 2 heads taller than him so I just ghost him.
I haven’t replied to him in 1-2 weeks and sometimes I still see him in school but I pretend I didn’t see him and walk away idk how to react any advise? It’s my fault because I didn’t know he was gay at first and thought he was lonely and water friends but I never flirt with him or anything and I always talk to him about the girls I EC.

Not that I am trying to show off, but I am naturally born with a nice figure and tend to get more attention from guys (Maybe being shorter is good?) The fact is, I dont even hit the gym and yet I have an athletic figure.
In fact, some of my female friends have been eating sour grapes lately, claiming that a rich guy who is trying to court me is purely after my looks. I mean cmon, in this era, where can you find a non pragmatic person? If you have the assets to offer, by all means you deserve a rich guy, so I dont understand what rights do they have to complain???

60090,106083,"Just random relationship thoughts.
If you’re wondering why your partner’s efforts/interest in your rs have declined drastically since the start of your rs (like say, maybe a year) for no good reason [key point] even though they absolutely swept you off your feet at the start, I would like to introduce you to the concept of love bombing: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/style/love-bombing.html
There are no guarantees about your partner being a narcissist but it is important to have some self-awareness to know when a person actually loves/values you vs them entrapping you with disingenuous romantic actions at the start of the rs that manipulate you into gaining feelings for them, only for them to use your feelings for them, against you.
It’s easier said than done ofc, but if your partner disregards your emotions/concerns when you bring up this change, have the self-respect to walk away. You deserve someone who values who you are as a person and as a partner.

For context, I've never checked his phone before. However his behaviour over the last few weeks made me think that he might be hiding smth on his phone.
So this is what I found: He initiates texts with a 'long-time female friend' and offers to hang out constantly. In those texts are msgs like 'i miss your hugs', 'i would give you a hug if I bump into you on the streets' - these are things that he doesnt even say it to me. He's always the one initiating those texts, innocuous ones starting with 'hi', or 'you there?'. She is not responsive, so he will often have to follow up with a second text a few days later.
Their texts are infrequent. Sometimes he texts her right after waking up, other times he texts her late at night, right after we end our late night dates. Many of these texts are him asking whether she's available to meet.
He proceeds to meet said friend without updating me about it (context: we would always update each other where we're headed to and who we're meeting. It's just how we operate as we don't meet often). If she's just a normal friend, why hide it from me? I'm pretty chill with having friends of the opposite sxx and he knows that. We don't give each other shit for things like that.
Before this incident, we've always been open with each other how our week went, who we met during the week and the kind of interactions/conversations we had thoughout the week. I didn't know about this lady until I saw her name pinned right at the top of his telegram chat.
When confronted, he says he loves me and she's just a friend? Then why hide? Why try to cover up his tracks?

I have seen a few of them on linkedin and reaching out for fresh opportunities. While there are recruiters from other companies reaching out to them on the comment sections, I don't think any will pay remotely close to what Meta does. Or maybe they can try the hedge funds as Prof Ben mentioned, but lets be real. Those companies only take in like the top 10-20 SWEs per batch combined (not the mention the people who get to those places are literal geniuses if you stalk their profile). In comparison, Meta takes way more people. Methinks, it is time they accept that paycut (which is probably 50% or more)!

60081,106058,"We just decided to tie the knot! While this is typically a happy occasion for most, we are now hit with our biggest obstacle as a couple so far - housing affordability.
We are lucky/unlucky to be ineligible to BTO. We are in our mid-30s, have been slogging at our jobs for some time and for now, we have exceeded the $14,000 income ceiling (emphasis: for now!)
Typically, this would not be a big deal and we would just pay a tolerable premium to get a resale flat. Unfortunately, the huge run up in the last 2-3 years have driven this premium up to levels that no longer make sense. We are talking about $150K-$200K increases on average here.
As a side-rant to this, the current BTO system and the lottery effect creates a group of ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" (something that PM Lee cautioned against) with no meritocratic basis AT ALL.
We are extremely fearful of what is to come w.r.t. the economy.
- We both work in tech and are worried about our future incomes if the current climate persists.
- We are now in our mid-30s and do not have the luxury of a long time horizon.
- We started financial planning late in life and have not moved much due to our inexperience. We are aggressive savers who only started investing recently, and faced more losses than gains. Fortunately, we were conservative and the losses are not crippling.
- The economy looks to be forced into either a deep recession or hyper-inflation - neither of which are good outcomes. This is relevant to the options we intend to explore.
- Interest rates could go anywhere from here -- including much higher and much longer than predicted.
- Singapore has to continue to do well in order for us to maintain value in our property. There is no denying that we will be encountering further headwinds.
- We used to view housing as a necessary expense that we want to spend a prudent amount on. That means buying an affordable home that meets our needs, saving and investing the rest for our families and future.
These are the options we have before us, and none of them look good. Hoping to get your perspectives and advice.
1. Buy a resale flat now and pay the asking price. We aren't very savvy investors, but were aggressive savers. This means interest rates are less of a concern, but we will have less investable cash and assets as a result. Two ways to go about it -
1a. Buy a flat within our means and meets our needs, even if it means spending more in today's market - convenient location, close enough to MRT so we save on buying a car, long enough lease that we don't kick the can down to lease decay.
1b. Buy a flat below our means and suffer temporarily. Ulu place, new-ish flat so that lease decay is manageable. Wifey may not be too happy about this long-term, so we need to exit from this position well in 5 years, hopefully. Because common wisdom dictates ""happy wife, happy life.""
2. Wait, see and hope that prices become more rational. Live with parents first, buy later when flats hopefully become cheaper. The Government should be doing something about this, right? 15-month wait out period for downgraders is for them to create a corrective policy (one can only hope)? Right?
There is an element of risk here in timing the market. Prices may never revert to normal levels in the near term and we incur the costs of (1b), enjoying the home later and still end up paying more.
3. Buy a new launch EC. Sounded like a good plan until we realized that the PSF has also shot up crazily in recent years. The current ones run around $1,300-1,400 PSF. Interest rates are crazy now, but like we said, we are prudent savers and have the option of borrowing some from family to pay more upfront in cash so that we are less leveraged.
Side note: It is said that ECs are heavily subsidized by the Gov, but looking at these prices, we find that hard to believe.
This is a very aggressive option that makes us uncomfortable, given that we are conservative and are not speculators. However, it could make sense for the following reasons:
- The other housing options are clearly overpriced/risk being still overpriced after waiting.
- If there is a high chance of deploying our savings into this to keep pace with inflation. While we feel this is overpriced too, unlike the other options, it has a better chance of keeping pace with inflation, which is one of our bigger worries.
Our arguments against this:
- Property is generally a good hedge against inflation. But there are many other factors that determine a property's current and future price. We don't want to overpay for a hedge, but how do we know?
- This is one singular, concentrated bet that could do well/poorly/nothing at all. If it does nothing at all, that's still a loss given the huge opportunity cost.
tl;dr: Need home, not now but soon. Gov said we cannot BTO due to income ceiling, but we are worried about future income. Saved hard to expand our range of options, but all of them don't look like very good financial decisions in current climate, yet current climate could persist or even worsen. How ah?
