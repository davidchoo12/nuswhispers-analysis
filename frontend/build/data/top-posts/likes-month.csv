59599,105064,"I’m currently a year 1 student. My gf and I have been together since secondary school. We alr planned to get married next year when she graduates from university. She has weak immune system since birth and has been in and out of the hospital. Recently, she was diagnosed with terminal illness with low survival rate. Suddenly I lost all motivation in life. I don’t even want to go to school. To add this on, Her family is asking me to move on from her but I can’t do it. The reason is because they do not want my marital status to be widowed after their daughter pass on.
Life is so fking unfair. I hope all of you in a relationship will cherish each other and don’t do things that you will regret. Enjoy and spend more time together. Work out any arguments before it is too late.

59530,104917,"I'm currently dating a teacher for about 2 years, who is 3 years into the job (after PGDE). While we really love each other and are serious about one another, I'm a bit uncertain about our future together due to her workload and commitment to work.
Here is a sample of her average day:
Wake up at 540am
Leave house at 630am
Reach school by 710am
Teach classes till 130-2pm
CCA/ remedials/ meetings/ misc things till 530pm, leave school
Dabao, Reach home at 630pm
Eat dinner and chill to 8pm
Marking from 8 to 1130pm
Shower, etc, till 1230pm
Catch up on emails till 1am then sleep
So based on that, she works maybe 14-15 hours every weekday with just 4.5hrs of sleep and a good day every weekend just to catch up on work that couldn't be completed and lesson plans. Based on her salary, it's just ridiculous how much she has to work for that - Retail and F&B workers are better paid hourly than her.
I've been getting into fights with her and telling her that her lifestyle and is unsustainable as it'll lead to big burnouts and her health will suffer. On the flip end, she says that I'm not a teacher and I'd never understand her line of work.
Also, I realised that a lot of her teacher friends (female), are single well into late 30s and 40s - which I guess its due to their teaching lifestyle. On the flip end, most women I know from my line of work (private) are married by their late 30s.
I sincerely hope MOE can do something to lighten teacher's workloads. While that is wishful thinking, I'm wondering if I could get any advice on how to move forward...or move on.
Frankly I although I love her a lot, she had made it clear that her priority is to be a good teacher. So at the back of my mind, there is always this feeling that she loves teaching more than me.
Also, although we both agreed on having children, based on her workload, I don't see how we would be able to manage as I'm afraid she'll leave majority of the child rearing to me while she continues her passion. My job is way less tiring than hers and honestly I'm earning more than double of her - and in order for me to climb more, I need her to do her fair share of child rearing. I've mentioned to her that if we got married, I'd like for her to take a step back from her overloaded schedule and this was utterly shot down and more quarrels ensured.
So now I'm at a crossroads - should I push on and try to make things work, or try to move on to find someone who able to be more family oriented?

And notice that for morning and afternoon shifts, I don't have a dedicated break for lunch, unlike office workers? That's because we eat our lunch at our own desk while watching the trains move. If got incident, that's it, we'll let our lunch turn cold. We'll only eat until the incident is settled.
And I work 7 days a week, with 2 days rest. In each week we will do all 3 shifts but still in a reasonable pattern. At the end of my 3rd week of work, we will get 3 days of rest. And the 3rd week is always the best one as our last night shift ends on a Saturday morning, so that's the start of our precious 3 days break.
So if my friends were to jio me to go eat and wind down, I will screenshot and show my schedule to them so they have to plan accoding to my schedule, which I sometimes feel really bad about. My shift patterns also make it quite challenging to find a girlfriend and go on dates... ????
Despite the hectic shift pattern and messed up body clock, I still like my current job as my team mates, bosses and other colleagues are close knitted and make the hectic work hours more enjoyable and pleasant. ????

59526,104913,"Hi 104898,
I totally feel you as my husband also cheated on me and even went hotel with the mistress every single weekend for 4 months. Eventually when I expose them to her parents they broke off and he told me he’s just “playing” with her but when they’re together he told me he love her alot but he dk who he wants (WTF LOL) But he’s never the same even now that he’s single (or not idk) but i had learned to let go. We are together for 9 years at that point of time.
Currently we are just housemates staying in the same house while waiting for our BTO to MOP for the profits.
It’ll be a long painful journey and the trust and love can never be the same even if they broke up. Love yourself more and pamper yourself more. Although it might hurt like crazy now but trust me I’ve been through it, you’ll get over eventually and find everything not worth it for a bastard like him.
Now I’m doing so much better than him and bought things and did things I never get to do when I’m with him. I felt so much happier now despite still being stuck with him for another 2 years for the house. But i trust everything will be better soon.

59415,104714,"I'm with my girlfriend for 3 years. She's been bugging me to marry her and its really starting to stress me out. I didn't tell her I actually have a 6 figure savings accumulated from my deceased father's will on top of my own assets and let her think I'm a pauper. She even gave me money once when she thought my family finances was tight but I rejected it. A part of me decided she is the one after she did that.
My mother told me to never flaunt our wealth so as not to attract the wrong people so I guess I start to feel funny about money since young. We mostly go to hawkers and only visit restaurants when there is a special occasion like birthdays or Christmas. Our dates are usually very low costs. I like that when the weather permits, we have the habit of alighting earlier from the train or bus and spend more time walking together and talking to reach our destination.
I lied to her that we can't afford a flat yet and she showed hand me her savings and say she can and kept asking me not to waste her time in a joking way. Her family is pretty well to do. Her dad even gifted her a car when she got promoted but she sold it as she's not confident driving.
The problem I have with my gf may be insignificant to some couples. I don't really have any major red flags or issues about her. Even if she's not my gf, I would think of her as a great person to have around. I know other men will find her very eligible given her looks, personality and family background. My mother loves her and already considers her a daughter in law. But I have a but. I'm not ready. We are in our late 20s.
How do you become ready? I'm so in love with her but I just couldn't make myself get down on one knee and ask for her hand in marriage.

59588,105043,"AITA?
I was earning around 60k to 70k per annum for 10 years before quitting to be a sahm. My husband earns more than me. My husband and I paid half each during the initial payment for the house with a remaining loan of 200k. We have separate and joint accounts. He has taken over paying for almost all the expenses for both of us. Including giving me an allowance which I was able to save from it too. We are thrifty, we don't own a car.
During the course of our marriage, he had asked me twice if we can repay some of the home loan, using both our savings. I've obliged as I wanted to ease his burden. I've not need to spend from my own pocket as he's given me a supplementary card for all expenses and he also paylah whenever I pay for things. From kid to house stuff and even my own personal shopping, insurance and other smaller bills he would paylah me sometimes and will do it when I ask too. Basically he's paying for almost everything and I'm grateful for that. I'm also a simple person. I used to buy Chanels and Pradas but have since adjusted my spending habits since becoming a mom. I can live on 500 or less a month if I want to. I don't scrimp when it comes to food. I can buy things on sale but I also won't deprive my child of a new book or toy on birthdays or xmas when my child asks for it.
We won a decent amount not long ago and we used that to fully repay our condo. We are debt free since. We didn't tell anyone about it.
Recently his family member asked if we can invest an amount in their business. Promising huge returns. All along I'm not on good terms with them and I don't trust them either. They have been changing what they do all along. My husband would like us to contribute to show support. He say I got the spare cash, why not? I have a strong feeling their business will fail again and we won't get back single cent. My relatives said me and my husband are the only ones staying in condo, we should give others a chance to upgrade from hdbs. I think it's rubbish talk.
I don't want my husband to help them either. I have plans to work when my child gets older but whatever I have now, it's my own savings. I feel very annoyed his relatives act like I ought to help them. I'm not a big investor so I prefer to keep most of my money in banks. I do share and invest in the same stocks as my husband so even though my husband don't really know the exact amount that I have, he has a rough idea that I have more than 100k. I know its not a lot. But since I'm not working right now, it's my lifeline.
AITA for refusing to give his relatives a single cent and also stopping my husband from helping them?

59540,104949,"To: #104917, what your gf went through is the daily life of a teacher. And you said she is only 3 years into the job, means she's probably still considered a BT ,depending if her contract is over. Naturally, she's at the stage where she has a lot of new and cool ideas she wants to try with her class. I was like her last year and this is my 5th year. Even up till today, I still have colleagues who sleeps at 1am or close to midnight daily and then wake up at 5am to prepare for work. I know of a teacher who coaxes her children to sleep and then work till midnight. So this is where the couple must compromise.
There's no wrong in you thinking like this. My bf has verbalised many times that I'll not have time for him when we get married, which is true. And I'm not denying it so I made it a point to to at least spend a weekday night and one full sat/sun with him. So you need to find a common ground with her. Speak to her about your concerns but not getting into fights.
I've seen a case where the bf forced the gf to quit this line. She left and joined elsewhere but she wasn't happy with the decision she made and will sometimes bring it up to us. So there's some unhappiness already.
I agree with her that you cannot understand her line of work, but at least appreciate what she's doing. Bring her to her favourite place over the weekend, spend quality time with her or praise her for what she has been doing so far. Teaching is a thankless job. Be thankful that she's putting in the effort for all her students. Yes, she may feel burnout. And that is when she needs the support of her loved ones the most. I've had my share of burnt out and I wanted to leave this profession but it was my bf who persuaded me and reminded me of why am I in this field. So be that partner your gf needs.
I'm sure the two of you are committed in this relationship, but she is also committed to her work. This is something that you cannot take away from her. Teaching is a weird thing. We feel alive when we teach, when we interact with the kids and when we see them grow day by day. I feel excited to see my children. They're way better than dealing with adults. So start seeing things from her perspective and also let her see from your perspective. Find a common ground or a comfortable arrangement for the both of you. All the best ya!

59575,105020,"Sigh, it's so tiring being a female. I've always been a happy-go-lucky and bubbly kinda girl. And I'm always uncomfortable when girls around me like to compare everything and anything. In the beginning, it was the education level. I graduated from poly and had lower income than some friends. So even though some of them gave me the attitude that I'm ""lower"" than them, I don't mind because I'm not one who always want to win. I'm just comfortable in my own skin. Somehow, I got into another job where I earned probably x2 or x3 of their income. They actually didn't know(by chance) until few years later because I also didn't go around saying. It wasn't until one day they caught me driving my car then they asked about it. In fact...I was hiding the fact that I bought it...for fear they will (again) compare this and that. So this group of girls likes to compare education level, income, car, house etc.
Another group of girls is different. They don't compare about education and income because they don't have much. So they start to compare how many guys are wooing them and giving them attention. My motto is just go out drink and have fun. But they always have to compete by asking how many guys you know tonight etc. While I'm definitely UNABLE to be as initiative and passionate as them, I can't deny that the peer pressure had influenced me to be slightly friendlier to strangers who approached me(which I'm usually not). Then, for subsequent gatherings, every girl is supposed to bring guys(to drink together - I didn't do anything else). I was slowly brainwashed into this is normal. But it's not. The guys gave me so many problems when they get jealous over one another. Some tried to kiss me when they were drunk. Some girlfriends got into conflicts with me when they started to like my guy friends because my guy friends are much better looking than theirs.
It was so chaotic until 1 day I told myself I got to stop all this nonsense. So, I stopped bringing my guy friends to gatherings, lying that they can't make it. No matter how much the girls ridiculed me at not having any guy friends with me, I ignored them. To my shock, one of them liked my guy friend so much that she asked him to join without my knowledge. Things became awkward between me and him. My friends knew he liked me but I don't like him(It's not that I don't like him lah, I don't like his advances when he's drunk. He treats me pretty well when he's sober). So gradually they invited him to gatherings but excluded me so that it's easier to seduce him without me around. I suddenly realized how toxic this group is and I ditched them.
Years later, I got to know a bunch of really awesome girls who are totally not like that. They don't compare about this and that and values girls' friendship more than other shitty unimportant things. And I realized the similarities among them: They are happy and comfortable in their own skin, just like me, not competitive. Happy as in really happy with their married/attached/single status - Not the kind who are married/attached but unhappy OR single but so desperate to get laid those kind. They value friendship of us girls alot. Last but not least, they are more or less the same caliber as me. As in, we are pretty much equally well-liked - nobody gets left out. Everytime we go out, different guys will approach us. As in, it's very balanced. It's always so much fun with them. (For the previous group, it wasn't very balanced - I had too much attention than the others.
In short, girls....stick with happy people. Happy and uncompetitive people. With my vast experience with toxic females......the more competitive they are, the more toxic they are. And it has nothing to do with age. Some 30 years old, married already, still behave like petty teenagers, thinking they are starring the Mean Girls movie.

I don't know how long more do I have in this world but I do have things I wish I had done. I wished that my husband had been truthful to me before we have got married that he have feelings for other people and not lied to me (I suspected before but he declined so i chose to trust him) at least before I got married, I would have a choice to accept it or call off the wedding. (I had only found out about this until almost a decade long with him) I wished I had went to more places and not just save or spend it on other people. I wished I had enjoyed more in life. I wished I had the courage to speak up my feelings to people when I had the chance. I wished I had removed that home wrecker long ago and trust my instincts but not trust her because she had an affair with my husband. Sometimes I wonder if bad people will have their karma.

59438,104769,"For the longest time I couldn't get over my ex. We'd break up and then the next time he came to me to hook up I'd let him. My life was a mess and I wasnt doing as well as my parents or teachers thought I could be doing.
As shallow as it sounds I think I was addicted to him because he gave off a unique vibe, like he was book smart but didn't carry himself like the usual ""nerdy"" kind of guy, and it honestly turned me on. It didn't help my case that he was really good in bed as well so we always ended up fwbs after breaking up.
I think the breaking point was when my ex and me broke up about a week before a short staycation and we still ended up going for it and sleeping together. After that trip I told myself no more and that I think was when I decided to make a change in my life, not just in terms of getting over him but like overall everything. It was like a thing I did to get over him by distracting myself.
But slowly I've learned to be okay by myself and to work on myself again.
I've graduated this year (about a year later than the rest of the people my age) and I guess I realised that I've grown a lot from my experiences over the past few years.
Guess I'm just posting this because this is the one part of my journey I'm not too proud to put my name to, but I'm still proud of myself for making the journey. Somewhere along this path I stopped doing it to distract myself and get over him and started doing it for myself. Today I looked back at my path through JC and uni and realised that I wouldn't have had it any other way, and I finally feel like I've gotten to where I thought wouldn't be possible years before :)

so hey guess who read your post? thats right its your skinny bf. sorry for the fact that im not hunky like other guys put there but as you know i have to juggle between school and work, then there’s you, so there is hardly any time to work out.
i can’t believe that after all the things i did for you, you’d have the audacity to even consider hooking up with one of your hall mates regardless whether you did or didn’t. i work my ass off after school to pay for our dates, buy your designer apparels and bags to the point i only eat two meals a day, which consists of either bread or a simple rice with vegetables, and this is what i get in return.
i scrimp and save just so i can provide you with the things you desire, to the point i can’t help but get a tad bit envious when i walk by Starbucks only to catch a glimpse my friends enjoying their cold brew when all i can afford is a cup of kopi-c. i have never complained or showed you how tired and stressed out i am over this because i really love you and want the best for you, then again, you had thoughts of cheating.
it irks me when i realised im dating someone who i eventually plan to marry develop such obscene thoughts towards other men so i have decided to initiate a break up after leaving this message here. congrats on being free and good luck with those men who are only after your body Agnes L**, tbh you aren’t that good looking yourself lmfao so no idea where u got that self confidence from haha.
cheers.

59590,105049,"To the OPs who have been posting regarding their relationship woes here... here's my story:
Used to date A for 5-6 years - firmly believed that ""as long as I put in the effort, we'd make it through and be happy""... I learnt that: if he wasn't nice to you at the start/ honeymoon stage, the likelihood of him changing his attitude towards you is close to zero. If you let him treat you like a doormat at the start, you'll be a doormat throughout the relationship. A would be expecting us to go dutch for every single meal, A would expect me to do HIS work for him, A would even go overseas with his ""girl friends"" because they were ""just friends"". When I finally realised my worth and tried to end things, A made all sorts of promises to treat me better... only to revert to his usual self again after a few months.
Started dating B 2-3 years ago. Having learnt from my past relationship, decided that I'm not gonna settle this time round - honestly think it's the best decision I've made. You can easily tell when you're a priority to someone. B offers to pay for almost every meal although I'm currently earning more (Just a disclaimer in case I get bashed: I pay for meals too????), B offers to send me home even if we were at an area nearer to his house, B never ignores my texts for hours on end unless he's asleep, B stood up for me when his friends (of many years) bad-mouthed me and (of his own will) decided not to meet them as often anymore.
So yea, my point really is: It is possible to find someone who treats you as his/her priority, please do not settle!!!

59416,104716,"As a woman working in the customer service line, I love my job. I like the hours and the pay. I don't need to bring my work home. I also like the aspect of looking well groomed for the job. I've managed to save more than half my monthly salary and clock up a decent amount in just a few years. I really enjoy the freedom and independence that this job brings me. And it's very satisfying when I get a great feedback from a happy customer.
My only gripe with this job is that I get picked up so often by men who mistaken my smiles as sexual interest and I get asked out or touched instead. I hated this part so much I wore a wedding ring even though I'm single. The worst part is that some of my other colleagues say I am stupid for cutting off my fortune path. I may meet a rich guy but I ruined it for myself. I also sometimes get inappropriate treatment from male colleagues who were on good terms but suddenly just want to see if I'm keen to sleep around. This is offensive to me. I've never felt that I've given any vibes that I'm sexually available. To be friendly and approachable is a part of my job. A smile does that? To show an act of concern and care just because my JOB requires me to behave this way makes a guy think that?
Once I wasn't having a good day, a male colleague walked over and asked me to smile. The tone was kinda sexist but I sucked it up and finished my day in my professional best. I find the more advances I get, the more I start to keep to myself.
I just want to get my job done, get my pay and go home alone at the end of the day. Why can't these men get it? A smile doesn't mean I want to sleep with you!

A typical day for me:
Wake up: 7.45am
Get ready, take public transport to work
Reach office: 9am
Attend meetings, do drawings, answer email.
Lunch: 1pm
Continue to attend site meetings, do more drawings and 3d modelling till 6.30pm.
Go for dinner near office and return to work: 7.30pm
Being able to actually do work after a whole day of meetings till 9.30pm
Reach home around 10.15pm.
Shower and relax, sleep around 12.30am.
On days of submission we can OT till about 11pm to 1am. This is quite a norm in our industry and as more of my colleagues quit in despair, the workload is passed on to those that remain in the firm. It would take months before a new hire comes in.
I don't really see a future in this as it is clearly unsustainable. Most of the seniors and supervisors in their late 30s to 40s are unmarried and lead the same lifestyle. They are disgruntled but unable /unwilling to pivot to other industries.
On top of the heavy workload, the pay is quite sad too. We spent an extra year getting a masters, yet the pay range is about the same as a normal honours grad and the increment is very much slower than any other industry (looking at 200 to 400 every 2 years). Whats worse is that most firms do not give AWS, and bonuses are scarce (not every year). We have raised this to the firm but they are pretty cash strapped after covid and can't do anything about it.
Having worked for 5 years in the industry, I feel that it is time to throw in the towel. It is kinda sad, thinking back about all the hardwork we put in school and countless OT days in the job. But the hard truth is that the lifestyle and pay is no longer sustainable, despite liking the work I do. ""Passion"" is a word thrown around in this field whenever the firm doesn't want to compensate us fairly. (most of us would roll eye to that). Looking forward, I am scared to become what my seniors have become, lifeless zombies that do not have a life beyond work, or a family and savings.
I feel uncertain about the future, as do my entire batch. We often gather to discuss whats there for us and those who have left all agreed that it was the best decision they ever made. To my juniors, please talk to more people in the industry and learn more skills beyond architecture, just in case you want to make a u-turn. To my seniors, I do hope that you can give some advice and personal experience about staying on in the industry and your thoughts. Thanks.

Secretly I hate lazy and fat people. If you're lazy and not fat I won't find it as annoying. But I really cannot stand fat people. Those who are so fat that they need a motorized wheelchair to move around. I also hate fat youngsters. You got no excuse to eat till your face swell to double the size and look more pregnant than a woman.
I'm in my 30s and I find it ridiculous that some friends my age cannot control their weight. Please don't give the excuse about body type or medical when you have no health issues. I have friends who managed to look the same or even start to take care of themselves after having kids. So I don't believe its acceptable to look like a balloon after NS. Diet and exercise plays a huge part for sure. Not caring about these 2 elements just shows that you're lazy.
I have a cousin who was fit during his teenage years. NS improved his shape but he got fatter and fatter after that. Always eat junk food and smoke and drink. I was so shocked to see him recently as he haven't been updating his fb posts for years. He has ballooned to triple his size. His fiance is normal built I wonder how does he not crush her to death when they have sex or if he can even make it stand? His face is so swollen I don't even know where to look when I talk to him. He's literally panting and breathing very hard even while he's seated. Not like he's on a treadmill. And he's not even half way through his 20s.
I wouldn't be able to not do anything about it if I looked like him.

59554,104980,"Is it really too much to refuse to date guys who still live at home with their parents?
I get that it's normal here for people to live at home well into their adult life, but it's just not for me.
I get so many excuses like:
""Housing is expensive and no one can afford to buy a home / waiting to BTO"" Okay? People can rent. I rent. Nearly all of my friends rent. It's doable. I'm not saying people have to buy a house.
""It's normal for guys to live at home so you just have to accept it"" Why do I need to accept it? I don't. I can just do what I'm doing now and refuse to date guys who still live at home.
""Why don't you just go to a hotel room then?"" Because I don't want to feel like a call girl or that I'm sneaking around behind their parent's back.
""My parents are fine with me bringing girls over"" Good for them, but I'm not going to do anything when their parents are RIGHT THERE IN THE SAME HOUSE. It's wildly uncomfortable.
The worst are the people who call me a gold digger, because to them the only people who can move out are the super rich (not true) and the people who somehow twisted this into a race thing. In their mind the vast majority of guys who don't live at home are foreigners, so my standard means I'm a self-hating racist because it means I'll be rejecting all the local guys and mostly dating foreign guys.
To me it's got nothing to do with money, and nothing to do with race. It's a sign of independence. My experiences of dating guys who still live at home isn't good. I've had guys try to sneak me into a completely dark house because it's 2am and of course their parents are asleep. Guys who had to update their parents on their whereabouts, report when they leave, if they're going to get back late. Guys who still let their parents/maid feed them, do their laundry, do their dishes, do all the house chores. Guys who tried to change a date location because their parents didn't think it was a good idea. Ever since I've started only dating guys who've moved out, I don't run into issues like hthat anymore.
There's not quite any replacement for living alone. I want to date a guy that's used to living alone and handling all the things that come with it. Someone who's completely cut the apron strings.
I don't think that's a high standard at all, so I'm tired of getting so much shit for it

59496,104865,"TLDR: Found out fiancé and his fam are planning to get me pregnant
Admin pls don’t filter this, I don’t have anyone to turn to, not even my parents. Trying to keep this short, am in my mid 20s, fiancé in his mid 30s. I enjoy being with him alot. We’ve been tgt for long and l made it clear from the start that I only wanted a child at 30, which he agreed to. Why at such a late age is because I wanted to continue studying after Uni. At present, I’ve gotten my masters and am very contented with my job. Not long after I graduated, fiancé proposed and I noticed some changes. The topic of kids started becoming more frequent. From “see how cute xx’s babies are” to “what will u do if u suddenly got pregnant? You won’t abort the baby right?” Whenever his nephew and niece visited, his parents started joking that I should pop out a playmate for them soon.
A few weeks ago, fiancé drove out to get dinner while I stayed in his room to finish a report on his computer. It’s my fault, I opened his desktop WhatsApp out of curiosity, just wanting to see who he was texting. I totally take the blame at this part. Everything seemed fine until I saw my name mentioned by his dad. I clicked the convo, and it was them exchanging links on how to get a woman pregnant inconspicuously. His dad wrote that he’d done something similar with his mom and she never regretted having more kids than she originally intended so “(my name) will be thankful next time”
I tried to minimise interaction with his fam after that, but still kept things usual. They’ve treated me with a lot of love and kindness, even offering to buy a condo for us when we got engaged. When I brought this issue up with my mom, she echoed the same sentiments that I should have a child as early as possible. She didn’t think there was much to it since fiancé and his fam are generous and well to do, so I’d have a comfortable life. When I talked to my dad, he didn’t support their actions but also advised me it was “dangerous to wait too long”. Right now I’m extremely wary when having sex with fiancé, which he has been requesting more of, in case he tries to pull anything funny. Have hinted and reminded him that I’d like another 4/5 years in the corporate world before having a child, but he brushes it off, jokingly saying that he’s more than ready to be a dad and take care of us, and his family also want to help raise our kids.
I’m not sure how to feel about this situation. I’m furious that no one is taking me seriously or respects my wishes. But I’m also scared to appear demanding and overreacting, with how people are downplaying the issue. I definitely don’t want to lose my fiancé because I still love him. This issue aside, I’ve always viewed him as my ideal partner in life, from looks, personality, charm and intelligence. It’s just that because of our age difference, while he has scaled the corporate ladder and feels comfortable settling down, I’m only just starting out. I wish I could go back in time to stop myself from going through his messages. Am I being selfish for wanting more time before having a child?

59586,105045,"I am interning at a certain popular e commerce company. I will be here until the end of the year, and it is quite dreadful everyday. It is not that my superiors are nasty. They are friendly and teach me stuff. However because most of the employees are not Singaporean, the work culture is quite different, even the way they treat Singaporeans is also different. They only care about their fellow countrymen, so if the team consists of people from different backgrounds, the team will not be bonded. It is quite obvious that they are only friendly with each other for work relations.
Recently a new full timer joined my team. He is also from that country. As such, he is treated extremely well. He was given a tour around the office and they even treated him lunch. Back when I joined, there was no such treatment lol. But I guess it is because I am a temporary staff there is no need to treat me that well. I am fine with that.
However, my supervisor has been assigning work that was meant for me, to him. Hence ever since he joined my workload has become significantly less and I don't learn as much anymore. I am also kept out of the loop for projects that I used to be part of, and he has replaced me. My supervisor even asked me to give him my script which I spent 1 entire month working on, so that he can take over my duties. Now I dread going to work because I want to be busy and learn things but now I cannot because everything has been passed to this new guy. Maybe my supervisor finds it easier to communicate with someone of similar background as her, so she stopped giving me important tasks and instead gave them to him.
It has come to the point where every day I have to ask for work because I have nothing to do. But the work assigned to me is extremely mundane. I miss the days before this new full timer joined. I really don't know how I am going to handle the next few months in this team.

59480,104843,"Just wanted to share my experience with my mother-in-law, because I feel like I need to write this out before I finally close this chapter. Super long, but I hope my story entertains someone at least...
Bluntly speaking, I hate my mother-in-law. I've been married 2 years and it's not gotten better. For context, my husband is Chinese Singaporean and I'm not (my exact race is irrelevant). We dated for a few years before he proposed and all those years, not once did she show me any unkindness. After getting married, while waiting for our BTO, we moved in with her first (supposed to be for just 10 months, and we only lasted 2 weeks).
She'd wake me up at 8am for no reason at all, except ""Daughter in law should be awake before parents in law. No need do anything, just be awake."" Meanwhile, my husband would sleep in. She bought me my own hamper because she said ""*my race* needs to be separated from her family -- who are all Chinese"". Whenever I'd eat food, she'd take photo and send my mom, and say ""This isn't a Chinese diet. No wonder she's getting fat"". And many other stories. So, 1 week in, we started quietly looking for a room to rent. When she found out, she said really crude things like... I was stealing her son away / I must've fed him nasi kang kang to brainwash him, etc. Then she texted my parents, ""I regret letting your daughter marry my son.""
That day itself, we moved back with my family instead -- slept on my parents' couch for 2 weeks until we found a place to move in to. My MIL continued sending harassment messages. Like, would tell my husband ""I'll beat her up when you're not at home."" It was too much.
I've kept myself generally low contact. I can't bear to call her, Mom, and after all the insults she's hurled at me - These take the cake:
1. For Guo Da Li and Si Dian Jing, she said I didn't need to receive it because I'm not Chinese anyway. But whenever she asks for things, she said I must give it because I'm marrying Chinese now.
2. I asked her, why she was so kind all the years I was a girlfriend. She said, even if I was his girlfriend for YEARS, it would be okay. But marriage means I must become Chinese. The man must always be followed.
3. She visited us once and I was scrubbing the toilet floor while my husband was wiping the fridge (chores day), then she scolded me for making her poor son clean. WTF.
4. My family paid for the wedding and she got more than half of the tables - she said my family providing for me is the reason I'm so spoiled, and dont know how to spoil her son instead. During the wedding, my parents, my father in law, all went around taking photos and stuff. She refused to greet people because she had no escort -- her wedding or what?? People commented about her, and our wedding photos has pics of her frowning, looking sleepy, playing phone games... and she says we never give her face??
5. But finally... last night, my grandfather (who was visiting us) had a seizure. My husband updated his parents, and instead of sympathy she told me to ""throw"" my grandparents back to my mom instead. I told her she had no sympathy, and she said ""So what?"". I've decided to cut her off. I blocked her on social media and messaging apps.
She's been calling my husband non-stop and insulting me, my upbringing, and is telling him, she regrets giving birth to him, and if he doesn't go back to her soon, she will jump off their HDB flat.
There's so many more things but I can't type them all. I'm tired. Is it wrong if I just genuinely dont care? I dont know how much disrespect I have to take.

THE CORNERS OF HIS HOUSE HAVE A LOT OF SPIDERS AND THEIR WOBWEBS AND I'M AFRAID OF SPIDERS AF. Like deathly afraid - will jump up, shriek, and run. My family has always been helping kill them... and from young till now, I have never managed to kill one myself. The last time I found one in my room and no one was around, I ran out of the house until my brother came back to kill it.
Where he is from and raised, he doesn't care about animals/insects and respects them - only killing them when truly necessary if they are pests (such as cockroaches, flies and mosquitoes). Other insects he will catch and release. He allows spiders to stay in the house as he believes they will keep mosquitoes and flies away by eating them.
So now I'm at a conundrum...he knows I'm afraid of spiders and has been trying to convince me that they are good but I can't...at the same time he won't clear the spiders as he says without them, there were a lot of mosquitoes...

59424,104729,"In Uni, one of my closest friends was this guy. We were super close and at one point I’d even consider him my BEST friend. In Y2 we realized that we both liked each other but decided not to pursue anything as we were both going to different countries for exchange in a few months. We made a promise to each other that we would wait till after exchange to see if we wanna pursue an rs. While I was on exchange I had some guys expressing interest in me but I rejected them because I was honoring our promise. But then I heard from a mutual friend that he was kind of seeing this girl he got close to on exchange. This whole time we were still texting pretty frequently and I kinda felt betrayed that he had moved on while I still honored our promise. But I understand, all’s fair in love and war so I wished him the best but told him that I hope we can still be good friends without being awkward. He reassured me saying yeah definitely we are lifelong friends. Anyway sometime in Y3S2 I got together with my current fiancé whereas he broke up. We stayed pretty good friends all this while, meeting frequently and even shared our rs woes with each other. Sadly ever since Uni ended we drifted apart, not texting or meeting up frequently especially since now we are all busy with work and adulting. Last week, I suddenly thought about him so I wanted to reach out to him to catch up over a meal. To my surprise, our chat history was gone. I checked on IG and realized he had unfollowed me as well. I reached out to some of our mutual friends privately but one of them told me that he wasn’t comfortable being friends with me anymore given our romantic history. My first reaction was confused because I have been with my fiancé for 3 years and all this time he’s been okay with it, he knows my fiancé and I even set him up with one of my friends once. I talked to another mutual friend about this and his theory is that once I got engaged he realized confirm no chance with me and that’s why he cut off contact. If this is really the case then I must have misread our friendship severely as I thought we were past the romantic “drama”. Now I just feel sad that I have lost what I mistook as a lifelong friend.

Telling her about the incident one fine evening Afew months into our marriage started sowing the seed of jealousy and I never saw it coming. My wife is loving, gentle and relentless in keepin up with “family image”.
I only realised my horror one fine day when we were shopping for a toy for our niece and she suggested Pokémon soft toys. I politely insisted that littles girls loves frozen princess and she went ape shit crazy on how I can’t give up my past and she is just a replacement.
Long story short, I brought a singing frozen princess and gave away the soft toy to some random neighbour in goodhood.sg (doing some good in the process and received some rescued bananas too!)
Now that the toys are given away, she has acted like it never happened. Pls advice if I need to bring her for some therapy as I’m very traumatised by this split personality. Sincerely thank u

59605,105076,"Job of typical hospital pharmacist.
We are on various shift but this is the common timing.
Official timing on contract: 830am - 530pm
630am: Wake up
645 am - Wake kids up and get them ready for school and myself ready for work.
7.15am - Drop kids to school
8am - Reach hospital for department meeting (Yes! Meeting is done outside of work timing -.-)
8.30am to 10am - Rounds with doctor and make intervention.
10am - 1pm - Clinical work
1pm to 2pm - Lunch (if you’re lucky to have time)
2pm to 3pm - Lunch duty (dispensing/processing prescriptions)
3 to 530pm - continuing clinical work. May have 1-2 meeting sometimes
530pm onwards - continue clinical work if didn’t manage to finish.
730pm - Finish clinical work.
730pm to 830pm onwards : Do non-clinical portfolio work such as manage inventory, billing, projects, writing workflow, planning roster. Planning recreational activity for department-.- etc etc
915pm: reached home
930pm: finish dinner
930-10pm: do some chores
10pm - 11pm: continue work that can be finish at home. Such as preparing slides for clinical discussion with students / other faculty members.
11pm: sleep.
Nightshift maybe 2x a year.
Weekends: work either Saturday or Sunday for 6hours.
9am - 3pm: No lunch break. So most of us work with an empty stomach and start to develop chronic gastric issue.
Free time on weekend: continue non-clinical portfolio work. Pray no one contact you on weekend to reprimand on your clinical mistake / ask you clinical questions/ ask to cover duty for someone at work. Most people lives in fear because of above.
*** FYI no extra pay if covering work for ppl.
Hardly any family time. Maybe just 2h per week? At most 4h per week?
Clinical work means but not limited to:
1) medicine reconciliation
2) reviewing of patients to ensure all medications are restarted or stop when necessary.
3) Verify medication orders to ensure Drs order appropriate medication for the condition
4) process Prescription
5) Answer Drug related query by healthcare team
6) etc etc etc
All in all:
1) No work life balance.
2) Super high workload.
3) Super low pay (less than 2K for fresh grad doing training), after 1 year average low - mid 3K (depend on class level ^ 2nd lower and below)
4) super super difficult to have annual leave approved. Even if approve is just a couple of days here and there. So cannot go oversea with friends or family
Not a place for ppl who wants to be rich. Unless you don’t care about money and just want to save life.

59483,104850,"Hi NUSWhispers community,
Recently on Reddit there was a post trending on the duffel bag girl. Basically, there is a girl who chopes the study room with her bag overnight for weeks so no one else but her could use the study room continually. Out of curiosity, I msg the OP of the post about it and I went to MacCommons to see the situation. At 11am tdy, there seems to be a small bag in one of the study rooms, matching the description of what the OP said. It seems that in the crowded MacCommons, no one dared to use the study room because someone had choped the study room overnight. According to the OP, this has been going on for weeks.
It is very selfish for the girl to do something like that because people may need to use the study room for interviews, grp discussion etc. What's more, the girl only came at 12pm.
Could I appeal to the kind people of Utown and ppl at MacCommons, if you see anyone who leaves a bag on the table to chope the whole room overnight to kindly put it in the lost & found pls ? Together, we can improve the NUS Community. I'm very sure many more deserving ppl who make the effort to come early in the morning would want a spot in the study room. That's all, thank you!

59569,105012,"tldr; AITA when my bf half-cancels on our staycay to attend a friend’s wedding and i’m upset about it?
we booked a staycay in early aug for the last weekend of aug, and this week he just got invited to his friend’s wedding. also, he is unable to bring a +1 as the friend said there are not enough seats. he said that he’ll be going on saturday from 6pm onwards so i’ll be alone all the way until midnight-ish in the room. he said he’ll come back after that and spend the night with me.
Firstly, he accepted the friend’s invite so late minute, and that he did not care about how I’d feel being left alone in the room for half a day when this is supposed to be our staycay. It’s like damn sus for a close friend to send an invitation so last minute. & I don’t think he respects my time and treats me like an option. I’ve turned down my friends’ or family’s invites to go out on that particular weekend because we got our staycay booked. But I don’t think he understands that this is basic respect.
I won’t be upset at all if his friend invited him before we made plans and I won’t stop him from going at all. I just find it very disrespectful for half-canceling on me we agreed to spend the weekend together beforehand. He made it seem like I’m making mountains out of molehills as he’ll be coming back after that.
AITA for being mad about this? Should I be more understanding and cincai to wait in the room for him lol? Please advise. Thank you!

Some countries I have been to, civilians actually give respect to uniform personnel by saying thanks to them, small gesture to them as an appreciation for standing up for the country. People like u will never go far in life because u don't know what is appreciation. That is probably there is no war in singapore and that is why u don't know how much these people has done for the country. But it's okay, ignorant people like u are just like frog in the well, thinking that oh, my dad and ex bf could do it , so u assume everyone should endure that same way.

59541,104950,"I'm the OP of #104917. Wow I didn't expect this to gain so much traction and feminist hate. I'll admit that I could have phrased my points better about teachers' workload in general as my main point - and highlighting it.
To clear things about people's misconceptions about the school holidays:
Mar: 1 week. Reality its a 2 day break as there are meetings and resource planning
Jun: 4 weeks. Reality it's about a 2 week break. There is a lot of planning involved here and meetings.
Sep: 1 week. Reality its also 2 days. Same reason as Mar.
Year end: 6 weeks. Reality it's about 3.5 weeks, a lot of year end reviews and planning for the next year.
Total about 2 + 10 + 2 +17 = 31 days of leave. On the higher end BUT there is no flexibility as everything is peak season. Its also frowned upon to take childcare leave and it requires multitude of approvals (from what I hear).
Her workload subject combination is as some guessed, very heavy. I can't help her in markings because my penmanship is crap (doctors handwriting) and it's not as simple as a tick. Often it's to re-write the entire line of the student's essay, or to draw out what the student need to correct with neat boxes and signs. And peer marking? It's impossible cause she teaches the classes which need more help.
Parents constantly complaining and bitching in their parent chat group is another thing. While majority are nice, there are a few rotten eggs who are super entitled and demand her spend more time with their kids, or complain over the smallest matters. There was a parent who complained and scolded her in front of the vice principal when it wasn't even her fault, then proceeded to scold the VP. Guess what the VP did - not only did she apologise to the parent, but later on also asked her to apologise for fear of this parent writing letter to MOE. Real.
I'm actually writing all this to highlight the sacrifices teachers have to make - and their workload often leads to burnout. She told me that last year alone half the newteachers left after their bond was up because they just couldn't take it. There must be some way to better manage it, or for MOE to increase the # of teachers by directing more budget into it, or us actually paying more to send to school. I theorised that if everyone paid school fees of additional 3k/yr, it'd be enough to hire 50%-80% more teachers. (I'm actually for this).
I also know of teachers who just do the bare minimum and get by. Their hours are way better but this is definitely not my partner's style.
Passion for teaching is good. But working 14-15hrs per weekday and spending 1 day on weekends (total of 80-85hrs per week - essentially double a regular salaried workers hours) - is this really what a ""wonderful teacher"" is? Surely to the parents of the students - YES. To the family, partner and kids of the teacher - NO, this is an overworked family member who is always on the brink of exhaustion.
And for all the feminists out there, I support her career. I just don't think the hours are quite right - you talk so much, would you work 80-85hrs per week?
Additionally, I don't require her to do housework - I'm kind of OCD on cleaning so I do it myself, and I've a part time helper who comes in 2 times a week. She actually stays with me in my condo (cohabiting for some time now) so I'm well aware of what I'm getting in to.
I'm actually 10ish years older than her into the middle of my career, working in big tech. Salary wise, it's very good - I can pay for my condo, car, and even give her
her monthly monthly salary as allowance and still have plenty left over. However, we have discussed this and even after that, she still wants to be a full time teacher as she loves the interactions with kids in school. Private tutoring would never give as much satisfaction (she did it in Uni).
She also doesn't like the idea of a helper as its an outsider of the house. Her family had bad experiences. And for the child rearing bit, I believe spending quality time with the children (well potential children) is the most important part. I can certainly do my part - and I expect her to do an equal share in it. Research has shown that spending quality time with the mother will improve the cognitive and social skills of the child.
And the witchunting about me not supporting her career. Why not the other way around? I have lesser work hours (typically 9-6), but I have night calls and have to travel at least once per quarter. Without a helper and parental support (her parents won't help her and my mum have passed on) , I would need help on this too right? We are happily cohabiting as there are no kids yet and I've learnt to sneak in time with her - but once kids come into the picture, it'll be very disruptive.
Lastly, why am I even considering leaving? Not by my choice - whenever we end a quarrel she'll say something along the lines of ""if you're not happy about the way i work, you go find another gf/wife la, you got so much money confirm find very fast"". Initially I brushed it off but after a while, it sticks.
Hope I could clarify some stuff - my main point is more about the amount of work (passionate?) teachers face and the challenges.

59469,104820,"I've been dating my gf for a year. Before we got together, she gave me the impression she's a person who loves to exercise, eat well, and takes great care of herself. She doesn't drink or smoke. Doesn't eat junk or processed food too. She moved into my place 4 months ago and I find she doesn't seem to be what she says she is.
She fills the kitchen with chips and chocolates. She orders korean alcoholic drinks in cartons and has more than a can every night. The freezer is full of frozen fried food, sweet drinks, snacks and ice cream. She tells me when it's that time of the month she will have craving for these kind of food. I can accept it but that time of the month can't possibly be everyday? She's snacking and drinking everyday while watching k drama. Then she will have craving to have korean instant noodles as supper at the same time.
She used to be dressier in the beginning and would deck out in colors that suit her but now she wears full on black everyday and it really doesn't sit well on my eyes. It's like she's ready to go to a funeral anytime. I'm a visual person and I also make effort to look good for her. I still go for regular haircuts and I still cycle and lift weights. I brush my teeth before I kiss her but she doesn't. She doesn't bother about her appearance anymore and I've not seen her exercise for months. I find myself getting increasingly frustrated at home while I'm with her.
I still love her but I find that she's very different from when we started to date. Is this how it's like living together? I haven't even talk about chores. There are some chores that she refuses to do and she said it's my place after all, so I'll have to be the one to do it. I think I'm covering 80% chores while she's only keen in doing 20%. She has the habit of leaving washed underwear in the toilet and I would have to be the one to take it out to hang because she would forget and ask me to do it instead. There's many other instances that she would forget to do something and I would be the one finishing the chore. I cannot imagine doing this long term.
When I try to talk about it she would get upset and binge snack and drink. I'm not even arguing with her. It's just talking in a calm tone.
Is that time of the month that bad that it becomes close to almost everyday? Or she's not what I think she is? How can I improve the situation?

She defended her actions by claiming that we were blocking her way.

59579,105038,"Seen a couple of posts in this page talking about boyfriends having close female friends. But still posting this in attempt to clear my mind and hopefully get some good advice.
My bf of 1 yr+ has a close female friend from uni days, B. My bf said they only meet once every few months and don’t communicate often other than to arrange meetups. He did tell me whenever he meets B, but never asked me to tag along or intro me to her before. At first, I never questioned their relationship and trusted my bf that it’s purely platonic. I thought since B seems happily married for few years already, unlikely anything will happen.
However, recently my gut feeling tells me something’s sus about them. A few things that happened:
- These days, almost every time we meet, I catch my bf texting B. She’ll tell him little things like what she eats, her travel plans, ask for his opinion on house purchase (my bf is not in real estate industry btw) etc. And he replies her immediately even while he is tgt with me eating / watching shows. Whereas he usually takes hours to reply my texts.
- For my bf’s bday this year, B bought him a lavish gift and she even drove over to his house to pass him the gift and bday cake at midnight. Isn’t that too much for a normal guy friend that you got no feelings for?
- My bf is damn lazy to dress up but he will put in effort to look nice for B. Once I went out with him before he met B, and he purposely went home early to change before meeting her. He said it’s because the place they’re dining at has smart casual dress code. He never even brought me to such places before!
- Once I was unwell and alone at home on a Sat night and asked him to come over, but he went ahead to meet B for dinner instead, saying he felt bad to cancel. Before the dinner, we talked on the phone and had a little argument about priorities. He got angry and asked me why must I be so unhappy with him meeting B on a Sat night, when B’s husband is perfectly fine about it? Which is totally out of point. He didn’t even ask me how I’d settle my meal or how I was feeling. In fact he ghosted me from the time they met until late afternoon the next day. I was so upset and hurt.
I want to know if these things my bf and B did are normal, or should I really be worried about these two? Wild thoughts are running in my head right now, thinking what if they used to hook up in the past. Or could he have chased her in the past but got friendzoned, and now both catching feelings again…..
Also need advice on how to communicate my insecurity to my bf without sounding unreasonable and making him turn defensive.

59425,104733,"To OP #104693: I'm in the same situation as you. So hoping to share my perspective which may help you.
I got married relatively early. after marriage, I had met 3 ladies at different stages of my life. The first lady was from my first job. Back then I guess it was just infatuation which I got over quickly.
The second lady was from my part time Uni days and she was a course mate who grew very close to me. We shared the same interests intellectually and emotionally and I sensed that we were mutually interested in each other. To get out of this situation, I had to keep reminding myself that I am married and should not advance any further. After graduating, we naturally grew distant.
As for the third lady, I got to know her from an outdoor activities group during Covid times. Recently she joined the organisation I am in and we grew abit closer due to her sometimes asking me for advice and sometimes asking each other out for lunch.
This third lady is the one I clicked with most intellectually and emotionally and in fact have the strongest feelings for.
But I know I still love my wife very much and I will not do anything to harm/betray her. So what I do is focus on my family and making sure all my thoughts are on them so that I can stop thinking about the third lady.
I know eventually, whatever strong feelings I have for her will be diluted by time and hopefully we can remain as platonic friends who continue to share the same outdoor activities interest.
Anyway all the best to you and your family. Just stay faithful and focus your thoughts on them and you should do fine.

59467,104818,"I (24F) feel like I’m a crazy girlfriend.
Context: My bf (26M) and I are busy with work during the weekdays and we meet only during the weekends. But, we do spend some time at night together like watching series on netflix party but not everyday.
Here’s the problem. Whenever we decided to watch drama or movie, he will take his time to bathe, play his phone games, sometimes even nap. Because of that, we can watch maximum 1 episode or a movie and we will head to sleep cause he say tired, next day he needs to work.
But, when it comes to playing computer games with his friend (girl), he can rush to eat, bathe and play until midnight even though there is work the following day.
He is also to a certain inflexible…? For example, there was once I texted him to do a certain activity with me but his friend (girl) texted him 5 mins earlier to play game. It’s not like he replied her then I ask. He saw both our messages at the same time and told me he’ll play with his friend since she asked first. At that point, I just wish he would prioritize me. To be honest, I feel jealous and I feel that I weigh lesser to him. I want to voice it to him about this but I feel that he will view me as a crazy girlfriend because there was once their friend said she is one of the “boys” and she got a bf too - when his friend’s gf voiced out that she is jealous.
Not sure if my feelings are valid or I’m the crazy girlfriend?
Is there any advice on how not to feel this way or how should I open this topic to my bf without him feeling like I’m the crazy girlfriend…

59537,104926,"NGL, sometimes I wish my boyfriend was in better shape. He treats me really well but he’s very underweight. I’ve tried to get him to workout but he’s not willing. I find myself fantasising about the fitter guys around me, and I’m finding it hard to stay faithful with the guys in hall dropping hints to me or outright asking to be FWB. I haven’t cheated yet but I’m growing quite impatient. After all, what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him right?

59477,104837,"I f up and snooped on my partners phone but hear me out.
My gf has always portrayed herself as someone innocent, those girls you'd imagine who never had s*x (I have never either) and we've never really engaged in dirty talks much because of religion. I came across one of her chat with her girl BFF and saw some texts that shocked me. Her being someone who keeps secrets would never tell me, but I went further to snoop on her phone (I messed up big time and I take responsibility for my actions).
Upon snooping I found her she has been talking dirty with this girl BFF over a guy she dated back in 2019 and she was saying stuff like ""we study diff stuff. We study on the bed "",""I'm wet downstairs, xxx loves to lick my below"".
It has changed my whole perspective of her and I see her in a different light. I can't help but think - has she actually done anything with these guys all along when she said she haven't? How do I confront her about it? I don't want to be lied to in a rs and had she been upfront about her body count (if any), I would have been fine. I am feeling so shitty now but I know whatever answer she gives me it will not satisfy me anymore.
