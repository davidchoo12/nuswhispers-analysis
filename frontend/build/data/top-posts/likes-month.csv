60682,107559,"I'm (M30) a rather successful social media influencer. But hear me out, it's not what you think it is.
My wife (F29) is someone who likes to talk about and shares whatever she sees on social media. She'll be doomscrolling TikTok the entire day, frequently sending me videos of influencers showing off their branded goods, having fun at holiday locations, etc and asking me when I will bring her there. Bitch please, I just left my cushy corporate job to start my own business, ain't nobody got time for that shit.
She was getting really annoying so I decided to take matters into my own hands. I decided to start influencing her social media feed. I used her laptop and to google for sports, crypto news, AI news, etc, stuff that I know she won't be interested in, searched for similar stuff on TikTok and started liking and following content creators she won't be interested in.
At first I thought it didn't work, but after a week I realized she wasn’t using TikTok that much and I asked her why. She complained that her feed was really boring and nothing she saw interested her. It was WORKING!
I decided to take things a step further by making her see stuff she's moderately interested in, yet is useful so that they'll slowly influence her lifestyle. She has gained a bit of weight since our wedding but she’s too lazy to start exercising, so I started using her account to follow some fitness and health influencers.
Guess what, a week later she dragged me to sign up for a gym membership together and booked some yoga classes. I’m pretty fit myself so I don’t really need that but I’m happy to see that she's doing something about her health. It has been a few months and she looks much healthier. I'm super happy with the results of my ""social media influencing"".
Guys, social media is such a powerful tool. Do try out ""social media influencing"" on your family/partners/kids and you might be surprised by the results.

60677,107434,"Hi there! I'm a 23yo female this year and I have recently started working after graduation in a pretty well paying job. Things are looking up for me and I also have a hunch that my boyfriend is going to propose soon because he has been probing me alot about ring preferences alot in the recent months. TBH he doesn't really have any red flags and has alot of green flags: he's kind, caring, family-oriented and gentlemanly. Sxx is also very good and it helps that we both have high libido. Career-wise he is also doing very well too. I genuinely do see a future with him and want to start a family with him.
HOWEVER theres just 1 thing... He is 10 years older than me and we've been dating for about 10 years as well. And if you did the math... Well yeah, I think you'd get it. It kinda was child grooming? I'll admit we starting having sex really early on into the relationship (less than a year) and we have been active throughout. We also haven't been using any protection but in his defence, it was a mutual decision.
Honestly I'm torn after doing some self-reflection.On one hand, i really love him and want to have a family. On the other I find it hard to come to peace with the past. I find it kinda messed up. I'm afraid that others will know about the past and whether it will affect my ability to be a good mother to my children. I would say yes in a heart beat if he asked me for marriage a few months ago but now I'm not sure. Please advice this troubled girl!

60684,107565,"I don’t understand why some people can be so spoiled and nasty. I will be coming back home after an exchange semester. I am so excited to be seeing my parents and sister after so long. I was telling a fellow exchange student about them coming to the airport to fetch me home.
This fellow exchange student is from a very wealthy family, parents have a car each and she even has her own car. Unfortunately, she knows that I am not so well to do. She went like “your family doesn’t even own a car right, so what’s the point of all of them coming all the way down… *snobbish laughter* just to take mrt back with you?!”
I felt that those words pierced my heart. Even though I know she isn’t exactly little miss tactful but I never expect this sort of hurtful words to come out from someone’s mouth. Things already go her way all the time, the moment she’s born, will it kill her to just be a decent human being…

60683,107531,"NUS architecture school in Singapore makes my head pain and is just a big scam! we are all fed up and really regret choosing this course.
Firstly, they all talking cock about our school's 5-year program. They say it's meant to prepare us to make safe and sturdy buildings, but school just whack us with design projects that are totally not practical.. But, NUS architecture never really teach us this important stuff!
Instead, they make us do many-many design projects, like keep playing Lego only. Also, why our course so long one? Got extra year but no extra skill. What for we give them more money and waste our time? No point the school, likes to use NUS brand and say its a top school.
Really scam all the way. scam the parents, scam the public.
Secondly, some say the schools and professors, only care about money. These professors maybe also don't know the practical things, that's why they become teachers. They just want to sit in the ivory tower, act blur, and enjoy the 'college good old days' forever and ever. Then, the big shots in the school just extend the course, because they think got professional feeling.
Another thing is, they keep selling us dreams. But when we finally graduate and step into the real world, then we kena shock. Suddenly, everything different from what we learn in school. Then we work like dog, but the pay peanuts. How to pay back student loans or make a living, and settle down?
Also got some seniors, say their employers think their education useless one. They spend five years studying architecture, but still kena call ""worthless"" in their own field. Simi sai is this?
So, everyone out there, you better think properly before you sign up for architecture school. It's like they play punk with you only. Kena conned big time, leh!

60676,107421,"I have been with my GF for about 7 years and everything is starting to become a bit stale. It is a stable type of relationship and I know that its time for me to commit and get a BTO, etc etc. Post-graduation, we also started working at super long hour jobs and hardly see each other except for admin talk about the future.
The thing is, I seriously wondering what is out there and if I have missed out in the 'testing' phase of life.
Recently at work, I have gotten to know a few interns that seem to show some interest in getting to know me and they have also invited me to go clubbing/drinks and meet their other friends outside of work.
A few of them have caught my eye and seriously damn tempting to just go for it. They seriously make me feel young again.
Of course, I wouldn't act on it but I'm just wondering, am I f***ed up to think this way?

60679,107477,"Is there a stigma against being an heir of a large-ish family business in Singapore?
My father founded a construction firm that gradually pivoted into real estate investments over a 30-year career. He has two children, my older brother and me. My older brother is highly educated and substantially older than I am. He went to the best IP school, then he attended Princeton for undergrad and has an MBA from Columbia. I was sent to Australia after doing badly for O-levels and I graduated with an accounting degree from Monash. My father is sort of old school. Because I'm a girl and the younger sibling, he doesn't believe that I should have anything to do with the business. After many an argument with him, I resigned to it as the way life just is. My dad has never refused money whenever I have asked for it. He never skimped on my education. More importantly, my brother treats me very well. He always pays for everything whenever I go out with him. He also contributed to my husband's student loans when my dad stood his ground and refused to help. I reasoned with myself that I already received far more than I should have had given my dad's culture.
My father got into some health issues recently and his greatest wish is for my brother to take over the family business. My brother, now working in New York City, refuses to grant him his wish. The only reason that I have ever heard from him is the fact that he doesn't want to be perceived as someone who inherited a fortune and did nothing to deserve it. The AUM of my father's company, just for context, is well into the high 8-figures (this was a pre-Covid estimate). To me, it seems natural for a child to take over his parent's business. It may not have squared with me that it had to be the first male child, but I never saw anything wrong with having a child for an heir. I attended a swanky foundation studies program in Melbourne and I have met many Singaporeans and Malaysians who are in-line to take over massive family businesses. If I had a successful business, my instinct is also to pass it on to the people I trust the most, in all likelihood it will be my children.
I really can't be bothered what my brother decides to do. I just think his reason for doing it is a little puzzling. Is there really a stigma in Singapore against children taking over family businesses? I see children taking over hawker stalls all the time. I also see children taking over wet market stalls, children taking over frozen seafood businesses, air-con service businesses, distributorships, and these are just the ones I know personally. It shouldn't be that big of a deal to take over a business that someone genuinely wants to give you should it?
What do you guys think?

60678,107472,"For new graduates confused abt pte housing fret not.
The most impt to be able to afford quality housing is ur salary. For pte housing, we try to aim for 8k starting pay at graduation as this will max out ur cpf oa contribution which u can pour into ur House
By 3 years into your job, your pay shld be 12k.
Don't buy a car. Please. Take mrt and bus. Adult Concession is just $128 per mth. Treat pte hire rides as a sin.
If you want a nice house early, DO NOT transfer to SA. Transferring to SA will cause issues with downpayment of 25%. Don't believe in those 1M65 idiots.
Transferring to SA is stupid coz if u can max out your cpf ceiling of 102k per year from age of 27, you will hit frs even without transferring.
You are permitted to eat avocados.Unlimited amount. I personally eat 4 daily. Quite cheap ntuc sell 4 for $6.95. And quite filling.
Keep your daily expense to less than $20 excluding avocadoes. Use sim only. Don't change phone too frequently. Cancel unnecessary Netflix Disney subscriptions. Don't give parents too much money. Under report ur income to them. Just max two credit card and pay ur credit card fully each month. Too much credit card affects the loan u can get next time. Don't buy too much new clothes, make up, accessories. Limit ur insurance spending by buying the correct things. Buy term insurance. Critical illness can opt out. But full hospitalization insurance is a must. Cancel gym. Go use the public fitness corner.
If u do the above, you shld be able to gather cash + oa of 600,000 by age 30 to 31 if girl and 32 to 33 if guy. Then u pour it into your downpayment and stamp duty for the first 2 bedroom rcr new lauch or 3 bedroom ocr new launch.
Tldr: avocado is not the problem. The problem is not earning enough and spending too much money.

60680,107511,"When people say that being short is not a problem, I feel that it is a dogwater statement.
First, closely scrutinize your own surrounding. In your workplace, how many of your higher-ups are actually short? If you ever see a short one, I bet that this guy had put in extra effort than the rest to get to where he is. The rest are just playing the corporate game on an easy mode. Also, what can be worse than being vertically challenged and bullied verbally by a taller boss? How many of you can actually stomach that?
Second, observe social media and the showbiz industry. Do guys of height (~170cm) form the norm, other than a few outliers such as Tom Cruise? Absolutely not.
Third, look at all those male insurance agents and survey personnels approaching you on the street. How many of them are not above 6 feet? Obviously this cannot be a coincidence. They are carefully chosen because they look good parading their own height and marketing the products at the same time.
Fortunately it is not too late. Short guys may be deprived of many opportunities but there is at least one thing that can be done. To all the short kings out there, get the highest education qualification and work hard. Not many people in the world have the ability to reach that level. You can avoid the situation of being bossed around in future with a good quality degree.

60681,107518,"To all NUS boys and male alumnis,
Have you ever wonder what happens to a victim of sexual assault after 20 years?
You may have seen news that sexual predators go to jail for a couple of months or a few years.
This pales in comparison to the suffering of a ""survivor"" of sexual assault!
Yes, I have gone for counselling
Yes, I have gone for therapy
Yes, I have got whatever help I could and still getting help.
While I'm still able to function daily, it's not normal to have insomnia and be fearful of sleeping. To feel unprotected and afraid someone might assault you again. To be constantly stressed.
To still have nightmares because these memories stay in your subconscious.
To affect your relationships or marriages because certain actions or words or situations can cause flashback, and you either want to run, freeze or hide in terror. And you feel sorry, embarrassed about your behaviour.
Dear men of society, if you ever have thoughts of preying on females, please consider this long-term consequence on your victims and prevent your fantasies from turning into tragic realities.
