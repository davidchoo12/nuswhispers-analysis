I'm pissed, I'm really pissed. I read Prof Ben Leong's essay on the strict selection criteria of CS3216/CS3217 and he openly admitted the elitist nature of these classes. To be frank, Prof Ben's elitist premise of these classes may seems righteous and reasonable, is very flawed and similar to income inequality, further perpetuates the divide between good and not-so-good programmers.
Every student who wants to take these classes should be be given the opportunity. In terms of outcome, if they do badly, well they do badly and face the music. We preach about equality of educational opportunity in Singapore but when it comes to walking the walk, SoC is not doing it. We all pay equal school fees don't we? Why are we denied equal access to quality modules?
On the argument that other students may suffer and their protection, isn't this already happening with the standard modules that most SoC students take? In the working world and other mods, sometimes we get the wrong group mates and we have to live with it. If they are really as good as made out to be, they will get through it.
I venture to say the selection criteria of CS3216/CS3217 are the only undergraduate modules in SoC and possibly NUS that reeks of the thinking of a certain old political party. No surprise why we still don't have another Facebook and Google that has spawned from CS3216/CS3217 alumni despite trying.
For the elite few who managed to enter either of these modules in the past and the coming semester, I congratulate you on your great effort and fortune in impressing the selection committee. For mere mortals like me, I have to contend myself in taking more mainstream modules.

3981,5579,"#5557 Rejection sucks man...but this is how it happens in the real world. You have to face it. Let me give you a personal experience: I was rejected for NTU scholarship interview because I failed to convince the panel about my achievements. I got good grades in English for A levels but I was so nervous during the interview that I stammered and stuttered most of the time. I made a bad first impression and the panel thought I was not competent enough.
It is because I got rejected that I joined NUS. Had I got the scholarship there, I would have joined NTU. Don't know whether I'm better off or worse off but I am definitely enjoying my life here and would consider myself successful. So it's not true that all rejections spell doom for your life.
Instead of blaming the selection process, I introspected and tried to improve my interview skills. With practice, my communication and interview skills are much better than before. However sad you may feel when you get rejected, most of the time there is no denying the bitter truth that you were not good enough. You can't change the unfair world, but you CAN change yourself.
Think harder. Why did the CS3216 committee reject you? Is it because they want a better coder than you? If so, you should utilise this time and sharpen your coding skills. When you apply for a job, the employers will pay more attention to your coding skills rather than scanning your transcript to look for 'CS3216'. Giant tech companies like Google and Facebook have multiple interview rounds to assess your technical and soft skills. Prepare yourself for these.
Paying same fees doesn't give us the right to take the same modules. All Singaporeans pay taxes, why doesn't everyone get the high-paying coveted government jobs. The world isn't fair to everyone, it is competitive. CAP, grades, intelligence, competence aren't everything in life, but they are not totally unimportant. When it comes to limited resources, only the best are chosen. Survival of the fittest.

Like the post in #5466, it is easy for you to say, ""just do better, try again, there are alternative routes, you don't need CS3216/CS3217"" when you have the opportunity and I don't. You are nobody to judge that I might not be able to handle the workload and be a tremendous drag on my potential teammates when I did not have a chance in the first place. Why have the double standard of pretending to be like the workforce and turn around and say those inside have to be protected? If one does not need CS3216/CS3217, why did you not walk the talk and not apply in the first place?
It's proof enough that Colin admitted that 99% of apps died after CS3216. This means most of the stuff you guys did weren't good enough to be commercially viable. So much for being the elite. Most of the more visible stuff from Computing students like NUSMods, NUSWhispers and the SoC Print app did not originate from CS3216/CS3217 in the first place.

4025,5643,"#5557 Long post guys, hang on.
The part about protecting you from the mod is not bullshitting.
3217 is a killer mod and not for the weak.
I got rejected for 3217 at first because my CAP was lower than the bar, but I appealed to the professor with my 2103 grades. There was an unexpected vacancy, so I got in.
We were doing assignments right from the first week and picking up Swift on the go. Assignments due every 1 or 2 weeks. The workload was crazy.
I was struggling really hard. I spent most of my time on 3217. I only took 4 mods that sem but my CAP went down.
So yeah there's a reason why they let the 'elites' in - because they can handle this killer mod and their normal mods together.
Honestly I don't regret doing 3217, but it's not like this shiny gateway to heaven that instantly makes you better- it's a hell that you have to work through and come out the better for, and YMMV depending on how much effort you put into it.
Also if you're rejected, it's not the end of the world. (Yes, coming from someone who got in eventually, you probably don't believe me.) Just find alternatives!
Whatever I learned in 3217 could be learned elsewhere. You just need to make the effort to learn. You don't need to take the module to learn what is taught there!
Regarding alternatives to learning what is taught in 3217, watching WWDC might be a good start or picking up an online course in iOS development.
If you want the experience of working on a big project, why not try contributing to TEAMMATES? Or find an internship?
If there's a will, there's a way. I'm sure the professors won't mind recommending other sources of learning too. :)

4034,5656,"In light of all the talk about CS3216/7 in #5557 & #5621, I feel like I need to get the word out about the other non-mainstream third year project modules.
CS3281/2 and CS3283/4 are both really good and underrated alternatives that require students to work independently and create a complex, large-scale app (usually from scratch). Most projects are for a real world client with real end users, which means your code will impact peoples' lives!
I had the privilege to conduct end-user testing of my project on behalf of my client and I can honestly say that seeing their eyes light up and hearing their positive feedback is the most gratifying thing in the world. It reinforced my passion for software engineering and encouraged me to put in even more effort for the rest of the project.
As with 3216/7, the 81/2 & 83/4 modules also take a less structured approach and most of the knowledge gained is self-learned, along with regular peer reviews to facilitate knowledge transfer between teams.
Teams are formed by students and you apply as a team for your preferred project. So in that sense, you are responsible for your own choices, whether you have struggling team members pulling you down or a hard working cohesive team lifting you up, is entirely on you.
This also means that not every project made is fantastic and not all groups are strong, but the onus is on you to make your project the best that it can be. (This is less of a problem for 81/2 because of the vnp/tp majority requirement, but in 83/4, there is broad range of students with varying abilities.)
Imo (and this is purely my opinion), CS3216/7 is a great 'networking' module to allow the 'elite' students to work together and get to know each other, but in order to achieve this, it has to break up the modules into multiple short intensive projects. While this allows for mingling, it sacrifices the opportunity for large scale software development during these short sprints.
To me, CS3216/7 is like trying to hit gold timing for 2.4km 3 times consecutively without breaks; it is intense and great training if you come out of it alive. But CS3281/2 & 3/4 is like running one single 42km marathon spanning 1 and 2 semesters respectively; it is not about short bursts of coding power, but pacing yourself throughout an entire year's worth of iterations to deliver a polished product without letting fatigue get in the way.
In short, the various 3rd year project modules target students with different goals and preferences (not just different abilities!); read up about ALL of them (CS3201/2, CP3208/9, CS3281/2, CS3283/4 & CS3216/7) and pick the one that you think is more suitable for you.
p/s: Look beyond the module name and descriptions because 'Thematic Systems' and 'Media Tech' are not very meaningful and do not do these modules justice.

I think we've all seen a pretty good example of the xenophobia us foreigners are subjected to; the comments and responses on this page prove so. I don't face racism everyday, but when I do, it hurts.
I'm a scholarship holder too. Go ahead, sue me, but my parents don't have enough money to finance an education abroad. If you all didn't know yet, the tuition fee for international students is DOUBLE that of Singaporeans. So yes, if you're coming from a poor family, it gets quite difficult.
Whatever I've done and whatever I've achieved is due to my own hard work. We're not having an easy time in university, we're working hard too, to get the grades we deserve.
Plus, you're forgetting the 3-6 year bond that comes attached with any govt. scholarship. We don't have the freedom to do what we want to do later. Imagine wanting to go for higher studies later in a university you're getting a scholarship to, but having to pass up the offer because MOE rejected bond deferment.
Imagine this now- you have to live for (upto) 10 years in a country where you're made to not feel welcome. How would you feel?

4247,6001,"I'm pretty much in support of the OP of #5961 and #5989. As a student contemplating graduate studies abroad, I don't really agree with the hostility we're directing towards international students, particularly when I don't want to be be on the receiving end of that elsewhere. Put yourself in their shoes - Would you like to be seen as a parasite just because you decided to learn elsewhere and broaden your horizons? And what if you have difficulty securing the means to study overseas without a scholarship? Wouldn't you want to look for scholarships offered by foreign universities (even governments)? Are we so xenophobic now that we hate everyone else in the world just because they're not 'one of us'? Definitely, definitely don't agree with that. Xenophobia is on the rise all across the world again, and that's a crying shame. Just look at the policies that are slamming down in the UK now, much less the increasing xenophobia in Australia, Europe, and the US. We should be breaking down borders these days, not building it up.
Essentially, it's just a simple matter of reciprocity, I feel. If you want to be treated with respect when overseas, why wouldn't you treat people with respect while they're here? Regardless of what they are like (and admittedly, some are less than pleasant--I'm sure we can all call to mind the relevant incidents, as blown out of proportion as some of them might be--, but that can also be said of our overseas students.), they're still people, and deserve to be treated as such. I for one am glad that they're here and raising the profile of NUS. Not only do they help boost us up the rankings (research alone does not make us a world-leading university), but they give us so many new experiences and worldviews while they're here too. You can't quantify things like that. I am reluctant to even call them 'benefits' because that risks a sort of objectification.
Even if you are willing to be treated appallingly in another country for the sake of your degree and that it isn't a big deal to you, I'm still not convinced by arguments that the 'their country their rules' argument is at all well-grounded. We're living in the 21st century, with all the benefits that provides. Primarily, it's a time when we can travel and still keep in contact with our loved ones, a time when heading out to search for work isn't the complete and utter uprooting of our lives as we know it. We can go anywhere and it's not a big deal for us anymore. Some of us will want to study elsewhere for a while. Why should that be penalised? So if the boundaries are more permeable than they've ever been, why should we employ such a knee-jerk and static response of 'foreignness' to it? Sure, local taxpayers put money into the area and should enjoy more privileges that foreigners don't because of it, but it's not like they don't bring money in and spend it here while they're here. We shouldn't be bitter or in any way unhappy about them receiving scholarships and/or the tuition grant, because they bring so much with them, and we have as many opportunities as they do to go elsewhere too. Ultimately, I hope that we've reached the stage where we can be a bit more moderate and welcoming in our response towards foreign students. As the OP pointed out, blaming them for government policy isn't exactly cool, and in the first place, maybe it isn't that bad a policy at all.

I recently returned from a long overseas exchange and realized why that is a problem for many Singaporeans. Foreigners grow up in the different environment as to the locals. Thus, when you first arrived in the country, even if you speak English fluently, you do not speak Singlish. That's not the main point. More importantly, you speak on a different frequency to the locals. They do not find the jokes you think it's funny; you do not like the food they enjoy very much. You might want to go out and explore the country while they prefer to stay home and watch tv. All these nuances provided the gap for the locals wanting to be close friends to you, and it will be trying for both parties to talk to each other without constantly thinking ""what should I say next?""

I'll bite. I accept that none of us can control the country we're born in. And without anything more, it would be at best slightly absurd and at worst incredibly unfair to expect excessive benefits simply because your parents had sex at spot A while a 'foreigner's' parents had sex at spot B.
However, Singaporean males do something called National Service. 50% of us make a contribution to the place we were born that I daresay is not matched by any citizens in any other developed country. This entitles (yes, entitles) us to demand some benefit in return. Duty is well and good, but that alone does not bind me to something as arbitrary as where I was born. I should be at least given a fair chance at making a decent living. Some people, hating the concept of compulsory conscription, might demand more. They would not be unjustified in doing so. In particular, it would be nice if people who did not do NS were not put on a pedestal and be given preferential treatment over people who gave 2 of the best years of their lives to the country. (To be intellectually coherent, this argument extends to a lesser extent to Singaporean females as well, but not many people are willing to accept that implication, so I will leave it at that.) The argument crumbles if there exist no foreign scholars with worse grades than a similar Singaporean with a comparable family background, but evidently that is not the case.
TLDR: Xenophobia is stupid, without anything more backing it up. But in the unique case of Singapore, we do in fact have something that justifies a Singaporeans first policy.
I suppose this may be seen as tasteless and unpopular, but I think it is a position with verifiable merit. I took care to inject nuance and lay out assumptions, and welcome criticism.

It is important that you know that you have done nothing wrong. And I wish you the best. I would love to talk to you and offer you some advice and support if there is some way for us to get in touch?

9169,13395,"Dear #13345;
Hi there. You say you're going for an abortion ""in a few weeks""? Please don't. Please get it done a.s.a.p. Change gynae if you have to. I recommend Dr Denas Chandra at Parkway East Hospital. I hope you have enough money for the procesure. Early abortions will set you back about $1k, but depends on procedure too. May be cheaper if you're still in early stages where the pills suffice. Cab home. Spend that extra $10. You'll be too weak to take public tpt. Keep your receipts. Rest well. Most importantly, do not feel. Put your emotions aside. Being strong means sticking to your logical side and braving the wind.
I suggest you also get some form of birth control.
Why should you listen to me? Because I was in your situation before. Don't try anything stupid. Don't smoke/drink/drugs. Just nurse yourself back to health. Don't fuck. Pray if it makes you feel better.
Excuse me for breaking the reality to you. Abortions are easy if you let go of the romanticizEd visionof the process being where your boyfriend pays and accompanies you etc. Your biggest barrier is the cops in your head and society telling you its wrong etc. also, possibly the hardest part is the financial price. Be prepared. Be strong. All the best.

9176,13404,"I'm the OP of #13345. I'd like to thank every commenter and subsequent OPs who wished me well and/or offered their help, know that I read every one of them and am greatly surprised and grateful for the support. However, as of now, I'm still leaning towards keeping my anonymity and am also just steeling myself mentally to go through it on my own, the way I know many young women have as well.
However, to the OP of #13395 - thank you so much for sharing your personal experience. May I know the breakdown of the timeframe it took you, from first screening appt, to the mandatory counselling, to the eventual abortion itself? Parkway, the one you went to, is a private hospital, so it's definitely much faster than the public route I'm likely to go through.
I'm in a dilemma, because the poly + referral to a public hospital + appt for counselling + finally the appt for the abortion itself is known to take up to a whopping 4 weeks; which is why I mentioned ""weeks"". However, this route will ""only"" cost about $500-800. However, I would absolutely hate to go through pregnancy and the nausea for another month more, and it will be increasingly difficult to hide the nausea from my family, of all things. A more advanced pregnancy will also complicate the procedure further and also drive the price up even higher. Going to a private clinic would swiftly settle everything within a few days, but it will cost up to an insane $1.5-8k, which I can barely afford. I'm so stressed out.

9192,13422,"Hi, I'm a different OP from previously. In reference to post #13345, I have experience in which you are lacking in.
So, I went to the polyclinic, visited the GP. told him i was pregnant, and told him I wanted to get a TOP. You have to tell him this, straight up. Then the poly set up an appt at KKH a week later. Went to the first appointment, went for the ultrasound. Then, turns out the fetus died at 7 weeks. That was tough. As you are waiting to see the doctor at the end to sign some papers and confirm the date of surgery, they will take you in for some counselling. 2 stops. One to discuss an alternate method, they will try to talk you out of it. The second, to discuss contraceptive methods. Then you see the doctor. The day surgery was a week later.
I remember the entire period being one of the most demanding periods I had ever gone through. Other than that, it was right smack during finals but I had no choice. That was tough. The nausea didn't stop until the day of the surgery.
Try to stay away from home. Minimise physical contact with your family, at least until everything is over. They will sense that something is wrong. However for me, I went through the entire thing without my family suspecting a single thing.
I paid $150 through medisave. The other $600 my bf of that time helped to offset the cost. Even then, it caused a lot of emotional strain between us. We are no longer together.
I wish you all the best, truly. I have been where you are. There will be countless nights leading up to the surgery where you feel stuck and it feels like shit but trust me, it gets better. Find people you can trust to confide in. If you can't, you have me. Most importantly, know that this is what you have to do and trust that you will get through this. God bless.

9279,13546,"This whole abortion saga has been getting so heated I just wanted to share my humble opinions on the issue, and hopefully be the voice of reason, as much as we are all imperfect creatures with our own biased views based on religion, family, or environmental factors.
(long post ahead, you have been warned)
1. Keep your emotions to yourself.
Majority of the posts are loaded with strong emotions, written in an antagonistic tone which makes it difficult for rational people to take you seriously. Reason and emotion are opposites, and your tone by itself makes it apparent which side you are on. You wouldn't bet a life changing decision on emotions, so why dispense life changing advice in this way?
2. Pre-marital sex is only a sin to people who believe it is.
I.e. religious people, or others who hold the same values. Aside from that, it is pleasurable, and an integral part of married life. I don't see any fault in anyone wanting to ""test-drive"" their partner's performance in bed. Those who disapprove should not attempt to stop anyone from sampling sex life with their potential partners in future.
The only things that would truly be difficult to approve of with regard to sex is promiscuity, because of the health hazards of sexually transmitted diseases, and infidelity, which is self explanatory.
3. Abortion is not the same as murder, or anything to the same degree.
Yes, it is a fact that life exists at the moment of conception, similar to the life that already existed before conception, in the form of a sperm (which is produced and resorbed in the millions daily) and an egg (which is lost in every menstrual cycle). Those are the same forms of life as the bacteria that give you an infection when you get a cut, or the bad sore throats that the GP gives you antibiotics for. Just a single cell/group of cells. But that doesn't stop you from washing your hands or rinsing your mouth with Listerine (kill the germs, feel the fresh!), and we all know you'll get your boyfriends and fathers to smash the next cockroach that crawls into your room, while you squash every ant in close proximity and rain insecticide down on innocent moths and spiders that venture into your room.
The key issue here is consciousness. Does the tiny ball of cells know it is alive? Does it know about its existence, or is it merely executing programmed commands within its genetic code? Is it able to feel pain? These are philosophical and medical questions that even experts cannot agree upon at times. And a young man/lady in his/her early 20s thinks he/she has it figured out. It is only natural that people like myself be skeptical about the strength of the source.
As for whether it can feel pain, it is generally accepted in the world of medicine and medical ethics that a foetus at 24 weeks should not, which is why abortion is only available to those less than 24 weeks pregnant. And this is the law in Singapore, with the only exception being cases of medically proven severe or lethal foetal abnormalities.
4. Say as much as the stake you have in this.
Many people seem to be confused about their role in all this. We are merely casual observers, with no part to play in the decision. The OP had already made up her mind, as seen from how she requested for people not to give pro-life comments. Why not just let her have it her way? After all, with all your high-and-mighty attitudes, WILL ANY OF YOU DISSING HER STAND OUT AND SUPPORT HER ""physically, mentally and financially"", where she mentioned she was ill-prepared? Otherwise, who are we really, to try forcing our uninvited intervention onto her? You would be merely leading her onto the tougher path void of numerous opportunities and then ABANDONING her to suffer by herself. (Note that the caps was just meant to highlight what I believe to be the main point of my argument, given the lack of bold or italics)
5. Only say what is constructive.
The OP quite obviously has strong opinions and has made up her mind. So why bother with all the preaching? You're not going to change her mind on this anonymous platform by insulting anyone and making derogatory comments about someone else's morality. Rather than propagating and intensifying the tension between pro-life and pro-choice, shouldn't we all try to support her through this traumatising experience in one way or another, and keeping to ourselves if we have nothing productive to contribute towards her cause?
To the least, you may graciously consider how you could write a thoughtful, intelligent comment with the necessary references on how to get help ""physically, mentally and financially"", e.g. NGO and government websites, then put forth the idea that she reconsiders her decision. If you can put forward a strong case on how her fears are unfounded, I'm sure she will be more than glad to read what you have to say.
Finally, to all those who supported the OP, I'm glad that a community of individuals who believe in getting things done exist. And to those who haven't been putting much thought into the tone of their comments, please do consider the impact of your actions and words in future. Because even if you won't, others will, and their opinions of you will be based on that (aka they will judge you the same way you passed judgement on the OP).
Take care, #13345, I wish you all the best in your pursuits in uni and in life.

16227,23930,"It is the Nussu exco elections now, but most probably don’t know and probably don’t care either. Maybe this is the reason why.
After the recent hoopla over orientation camps and Nussu’s inept response, my friend decided to run for Nussu exco together with some friends to make a change in Nussu. Before standing for election, each candidate has to get a nomination form signed by a proposer and a seconder. Unlike previous years, the seconder must be signed by a member of the outgoing faculty or non faculty club’s management committee instead of an ordinary student.
My friend approached someone in her faculty club’s management committee to sign her form. She was turned down because they were instructed by the outgoing Nussu exco to only sign the forms of a certain list of preferred candidates. The management committee cannot sign the forms of all other candidates who wish to run. My friend then approached others who were in non faculty clubs’ management committees and was told the same thing. Her friends also faced the same responses. She was distraught.
For an institution that claims to be representative and inclusive, such actions smack of hypocrisy. By barring other candidates from even reaching the ballot box, is the outgoing Nussu exco afraid that their preferred candidates are unable to withstand electoral scrutiny? With such blatant rigging of the election, why even bother having an election in the first place?
To the incoming Nussu president and exco, your positions and mandate will always be stained and qualified. You got there not on your own electoral merits, but by insider hijacking of the electoral will.

16237,23957,"The friend of #23930 is probably just salty. I ran for NUSSU exco last year and this year. We faced an opposition team last year who attempted to take over NUSSU exco. We were defenceless against these candidates who were armed with nothing more than popular support. Fortunately, we managed to mobilise just enough voters to keep them at bay. Some of our team members who were earmarked for positions earlier didn’t get through, but we managed to coopt them into the exco later on.
This is politics. Our job is not to make it easy for outsiders to take over the exco and destroy all the hard work we have achieved over the years. So what if more students support you? The outgoing exco and those involved in NUSSU are better placed than ordinary students to decide who should be in the exco. This isn’t a game of cards. This is your NUSSU and ours. We’ve spent a whole year building this and as long as we’re in charge, nobody is going to mount a political insurrection and knock it down.

16248,23975,"Former nussu volunteer here. Totally not surprised at what #23930 said. For years, the outgoing exco will form a team of preferred candidates to take over. They call it succession planning. The unwritten understanding last time was that the group of student leaders insiders will vote for the preferred candidates only at the internal elections stage. This renders any potential outsider group ineffective.
Cue the debacle last year when the outsider group pushed the preferred candidates to the brink at the external elections. Maybe this is why the insiders this year decided to nip the ""problem"" in the bud at the external stage by not signing the outsiders' nomination forms at all. Very cynical but very effective control mechanism. Did it happen this year? Can't say for sure but there is a strong possibility given what usually happens in previous years.
Is this right or wrong? Not entirely sure because on one hand we don't want buffoons to take over the exco but on the other hand, who is to say the insiders are better than ordinary students at judging who is a buffoon or not? Contestability in elections is good for nussu because it forces the candidates to reexamine their reasons for running instead of riding on the coattails of the outgoing exco. That reference is deliberate btw.
Also, there have been complaints for years that the election committee should not be staffed with members of the outgoing exco. This is because allegations of bias could taint the preferred candidates. This time round, the election committee is staffed by the outgoing president, vice president, finance secretary, welfare secretary and deputy welfare secretary. Disgruntled outsider candidates can easily use this as a good ground to insinuate bias.
Looks like this time round, nussu has got to come out and say publicly whether the biased actions have taken place. Silence means implicit admission of such unsavoury practices. If such biased actions have indeed taken place, it is only right that the entire election committee step down and restart the elections under a fresh election committee. A fresh election committee that is truly unconnected with the outgoing exco and untainted by allegations of bias.

16263,24000,"#23930 OP I thought I was the only one. I explored running for nussu exco but was told in no uncertain terms by my club’s management committee that they will not endorse my nomination forms. They said the current nussu exco already had candidates lined up to run through my club.
Curiously, I have never seen those candidates involved in my club’s events before while I was quite active in my club’s events. I guess when you are not favoured by the insiders, you will never be blessed by them and your path will be blocked.
I can also sympathise with #23930 OP on why he or she refuses to publicly identify himself or herself. My phone was bombarded with messages after that post came out, demanding to know whether I blew the lid off such an issue. The social pressure and cost of not whistleblowing is just way too high. Complain to the election committee? What for? They are the very ones who arranged for the preferred candidates to run in the first place.
Good luck to those still in the elections

This is expected when the election committee comprises of the outgoing exco themselves. I have little doubt that all the insider candidates will be “elected” in the elections tomorrow (ie Monday 29 August) because none of them are facing any contests.
To the incoming Nussu president and exco, remember that you may have the title of Nussu president or whatever fancy titles there may be, but you absolutely DO NOT represent us students and DO NOT speak for us. Your position is ILLEGITIMATE and we will NOT recognise your position (not that we can recognise you anyway given how rare you actually interact with students on the ground).

16426,24256,"To #23930: Merely my two-cents worth, but as someone with more background of the issue at hand, the need for Faculty/Non-Faculty clubs to endorse the nominee was initially brought up by the Management Committees (Faculty/Non-Faculty clubs) themselves as, in part, they do not want representatives running for elections under their club's name to go unvetted by their MCs. Primarily, the questions they have in mind are: 1) What have you done for my club? 2) What can you do for my club? ESSENTIALLY: Why should we lend you our support to run under the name of our club?
This is part of the efforts to ensure ""power"" is not concentrated within the Executive Committee, and to submit them to the vetting of the Management Committees. Each Management Committee is an autonomous body itself, and it is up to them to manage themselves, i.e. they are bodies separate from the Executive Committee and do not have to answer to the Executive Committee.
As to how these have been twisted to block people from attempting to run for elections, I am not sure. Could it be that the Management Committee is not in support of your friend's candidature, and it have been misconstrued to as such?
Furthermore, there is no written rule that prevents the endorsement by the MC members, and there is usually 10-20 MC members. Surely it's possible to find someone (willing to ""bend the rules"") to endorse?
Previously, there have been candidates who were not part of the ""incumbents"", and have yet been elected into the Executive Committee. Below are some references.
In 2015, 2 members of our ""opposition"" were elected in despite facing people with NUSSU background.

18502,28038,"This post is in response to #28025. I was in a similiar situation as you. I weighed over 80 kg and standing at 1.58m. I am always in the TAF club since primary school and has always been labelled as fat and obese. Somehow I managed to lost weight to 64 kg, and I gained back some weight (about 8kg) over these few years.
I don't like what I see everyday, especially when I see skinny and fit girls in school. So I decided to lose back the weight I gained these few years. At first it was like a moment of anger because people have been saying that I'm fat. Then after working out for a few weeks (I just did like a 25 min workout once every 2 days), I started to see changes to my body. My concentration was better, I was able to sleep better and had regular sleep patterns. My pants were starting to feel loose and what started out as a moment of anger turned out to be me wanting to stay healthy and fit so that I would be able to concentrate and focus better. Exercise is not so that you can attract people, but so that you can stay healthy and do the things you want to do.
It's not easy to shed the weight away, but we somehow need to take that step. Set small goals, because only you can do it. People can say nasty things to you to bring you down, but only you can prove to them with your determination! All the best girl!

18512,28050,"Dear #28025,
Here's my advice for you :)
1) You mentioned that you're 21 and you've never had a guy chase you before.
Well, I myself met my first boyfriend when I was 26 and my sister met her first boyfriend at 24 years old. Before our first relationships, we did not have suitors too. And yes, we're both overweight too. Although this might sound cliche, but you're still very young, you simply haven't met your Mr. Right yet.
2) You also mentioned that your friends asked you to slim down in order to find a boyfriend, giving you the impression that guys are superficial.
Honestly, I have many plus-sized female friends who actually have boyfriends. Some of them are even married now. I myself am also overweight but attached. What my boyfriend liked about me was my personality (kind, thoughtful, mature, etc). Thus, I would say that NOT all guys are superficial.
Yup, you don't have to change yourself at all!
Just be kind to people, be genuine, be confident :)

We are not fat shaming. We are addressing an issue of you wanting mainstream rewards, but refusing to give the mainstream price.
You clearly identified that a healthy weight, neither BMI 15 or BMI 30 is attractive to guys. But you refused to follow the mainstream concept. That is fine, you are no sheep, you can appreciate and love yourself. But you do not have the right to generalise guys as superficial, and feel entitled to a guy’s attention. You know what they want, you refuse and do not try to give them what they want, subsequently they refuse to give you what you want. That is fair. Can’t have your cake and eat it.
Genetics or not, honestly, girls have more to offer than looks. Girls with all kinds of looks get attached. But your sense of entitlement and your sweeping generalisation of half the world. That is the reason of the backlash and makes you so much less attractive. Absolutely not a fan of being tagged ‘superficial’ or ‘gold-digger’ because someone isn’t getting his/her way in life.

18519,28058,"RE: #28025 #28047
I am in a similar position to you, actually. I'm perhaps a bit smaller than you, at 70+ kg and 160cm. I'm fat. Yeah I'll admit that. But I'll also defend myself by saying I am more physically fit than most of my peers who are slimmer. Hear me out, all you haters who are about to flame me the same way you were flaming the other OP. I go for 3km runs at least twice a week. Whenever I go trekking with my friends, my stamina is obviously better. I used to be a competitive swimmer until JC. Doctors have performed stress tests and checked my lung capacity and my GI health and all of those things have come back better than normal. It can't be traced to an endocrine malfunction. I'm perfectly healthy. I'm just fat. You know why? Mostly because I love food.
I used to hate my body. I tried to starve myself a couple times. I dropped 5kg in two weeks, and it was addictive. I also stopped getting my period. I would get cold easily (I didn't think that's even possible in this climate). I got tired even faster than I got cold. My grades dropped. I didn't have the energy to care about anything except not eating.
By the time I lost 15 kg my bf got scared. Wait a minute! Got bf? Then why need starve lah? I had a boyfriend who loved me while I was fat. So why should I change? It had something to do with the way all you haters are flaming that other OP about being her ""best self"". Relatives and friends would tell me I really need to lose weight. Eventually I believed them. I didn't understand that my best self was the strong, fit individual with a large appetite. I'd been okayed by the doctor. So I knew I was already healthy. But I listened to those people who thought the only way I could be my ""best self"" was to be slim. At first, I tried simply eating less. My diet was already very good in quality, but maybe not quantity. After a couple months of painstakingly counting calories and calculating energy used by every activity, I got fed up. (No pun intended). There were no results. I was as fat as ever, and miserable as well. I decided that if I was going to put so much effort into this, I'd have to do something much more extreme in order to get results.
I got results, as noted earlier. My boyfriend noticed first and tried to show his concern. I was irritable at this point and dismissed his careful confrontations. Eventually he got some of my closer friends involved in a sort of mini intervention. I got better, I got help. I've been learning about body image ever since.
OP, whatever you do, don't go down the same path I did. Focus your efforts on being healthy, not slim. Keep yourself active. Eat a healthy diet to get all your nutrients. You only have one body, so appreciate it and love it and care for it. It can do so many things, like climb those stairs to CLB. Explore the things it can do, and push yourself further. You'd be surprised what you can do. It really doesn't matter what you look like, as long as you're healthy.
I'm very confident you'll find someone who is able to love you. Work on being your ""best self"", but don't let others define that for you. We all can improve. Always strive for the best.

18525,28064,"#28047: if you go on the internet looking for solidarity and support, you not only bark up the wrong tree; you are barking up the wrong tree, in the wrong postal code, and there is a fucking pack of vicious leopards waiting to jump all over you. I suggest something like tumblr, aka: the most easily offended site on the internet (though I can assure you I found no shortage of weird shit there).
https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/fat-is-beautiful
After the previous show of modest solidarity with you, here's what I have to say about some of your claims. You being 80 kgs did not bother me, but the factually wrong things you wrote set me off. There is a difference between fit and healthy. Fit = able to do feats of physical prowess. Healthy = without disease. A fit person is likely to be healthy, but not always. and vice versa. There have been quite a number of cases where a somewhat fit National Service man dropped dead after a routine 15km march. Likewise, healthiness depends not only on weight number, fat percentage, or size, but also activity level. Research have shown that an overweight man with an obvious belly doing manual physical work is healthier than an office worker who looks lean and go to the gym. I had a female colleague who is super thin, like a twig ready to be blown away by the winds. Well, she had high cholesterol and blood lipids.
That said, what is exactly your physical activity level: do you sit for most of your day: on bus, train, lecture hall, library, on the couch, whatever. Also, when was the last time you have a medical check up? We had a practice during one of our Physiology module where we took each other's blood pressure. We could not measure some people's BP. It turned out that their BP was so high that we simply did not think about it and did not pressure the ballast enough. Some were in the 120-180 range (normal is 80-120-ish). They entered University with normal BP but a few years of fast food, sedentary lifestyle, and stress sent it over. Get a simple check up: BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol. If you can, get an some ultrasound. You'll be surprised. Or get a body fat percentage estimate and see if it's in the normal range.
As for the wide frame claim. OK, wrap your index finger and thumb around your wrist (on the opposite hand) as tight as you can. Is the thumb overlapping your index finger? Or do they just touch? Or are they separated? If your thumb overlaps the index finger, you have a small frame. If they just touch, that's a normal frame. If they don't, that's a wide frame. The body frame affect less than you might think. Take whatever ""ideal"" weight, as indicated by the BMI chart (Singapore's Health Promotion Board recommend 23 and below, based on research indicated risk for Asian population), subtract 10% for a small frame, add 10% for a wide frame. For your BMI to be ""healthy"" (as promoted by Singapore HPB), you need to be around 1.78m tall.
Detox is mostly bullshit and the only thing it cleanses is your bank account. Your liver and kidney will do all the detoxing you'll ever need; unless you have kidney or liver failure. At that stage, a pill, juice cleanse, or detox water just won't help. You need a dialysis machine, or a transplant. Save that money and go for a checkup.
I generally don't label people who prefer X or Y. However, I do laugh a lot if their choice ends up blowing in their face. A richer husband, or a poorer husband generally increases the likelihood of cheating. If he's a lot richer, it's as if he earns the right to cheat because he works ""harder"". If he's poorer, he feels powerless in the relationship, so he cheats to get that power back. The sweet spot, according to research seems to be the wife earning 70% of the husband. Choosing someone purely for one unique selling point: look, virginity, whatever, may eventually backfires because the personality is rotten, they are useless otherwise, and the cruel, unrelenting march of time. Yes, I will laugh. And if you stay exactly they way you are, and ending up a crazy cat lady, yes, I will also laugh.
I'm not superficial. I'm just cruel, sociopath, and psychopath. You can't believe how happy I am when my cousin's marriage was breaking up. In the eyes of my parents and her parents, their marriage was the perfect match up: handsome husband, pretty wife, both highly educated with stable jobs in banking. Also, rich parents from both sides. Just some hiccups along the way: fundamentally, he's a bit dim, slow, and without a good sense of humor. She has a massive ego and a rather picky person. Actually everyone, including the parents has massive egos. And their marriage is failing.

18526,28063,"To all those who are taking on a lecturing tone towards #28025 on how unhealthy she is, I find it surprising that you can assume to know better about what's good for someone you have never known personally. You don't know her. Her struggles, her personality, her beliefs, her interests or her looks are all unknown to you, yet you seem to have already believed her to be someone without self control, without discipline, someone who's weak and without determination.
I find myself wanting to post this confession for her and for everyone who genuinely think that fat people are somehow primarily characterised by these characteristics. I disagree with her generalisations on guys, but feel that apart from OP's view on relationships, the shaming comments towards her have to be addressed.
I have always been overweight since primary school. This of course affected my self esteem, and up to lower secondary I always had little confidence in myself. My secondary school though had always taken PE lessons seriously, and I joined a CCA that required me to be relatively physically active, and while I have always hated running (other physical stuff's fine), I never lagged behind my peers and could always keep up.
But through it all, I hated my body. I hated how my waistline was thicker than everyone else; hated how my relatives would always comment about my body with snide remarks and contempt, as if being fat somehow made me lesser, made me less significant. When you're fat, it seems that your weight is the first thing everyone notices and want to talk about when they see you- not your academic ability, not how many people you've helped, and certainly not how happy you are. Because when you're fat, it sometimes seems like you lose agency over your own body. That somehow everyone wants to dictate what you can or cannot eat; what you can or cannot do. Fat people must be that way cos they don't know better, right?
So sometime in Sec2/3, the comments finally really got to me. I decided that perhaps what everyone was saying was true. I decided that by virtue of being fat, I was a failure of a person. As a fat person, I didn't deserve to eat well. As a fat person, I was such a bad example to everyone around me. And as such a failure, I didn't deserve the same things everyone had. So I started to punish myself. I would consider the day an absolute victory if I could get through 6am-6pm without eating anything but water and tea. My self esteem plummeted to ridiculous levels (that now appear silly since I started justifying to myself that I didn't deserve to even use hot water at home). This continued for almost 2 years before I managed to see how ridiculous I was being. (I did lose weight during this period, although not after the initial few months)
I guess, my point is, is this what you want to do when you post such comments? To compel someone through a tough psychological journey that will hopefully make them improve their lives? (Newsflash: It won't) I would guess that these shaming comments have been seen or heard by OP, and in fact by many others numerous times already and are nothing new. I have moved on in many ways from this period, but am bringing it up again to remind those who care that shaming doesn't help matters.
So please, reconsider the next time you post such comments. You don't know OP. You don't know me. And somehow, I don't think that having seen a glimpse of OP though her 2 posts is enough for you to be telling her how much discipline or control she lacks. What it does accomplish is contribute to a culture of fat shaming - a toxic, problematic phenomenon where the damage is more often than not, deeply psychological. Even if you have the best of intentions, I think there's no harm in trying your best to be a sensitive individual who encourages without shaming. The internet is already negative enough, so why not spread some more positivity? :)

18529,28068,"To the ones putting down the OP of #28025, please stop it.
(Sorry for the long post)
People who said that 'fat' or not is not dependent on genetics, and is dependent on lifestyle, eating habits etc, sorry but genetics do play a part. Some have a set of genes that predisposes them to gaining fat while others have a set of genes to help them stay lean. Variance in genetics do affect your susceptibility to obesity. In addition, the variation in individuals' hormones production do affect how much weight we gain or loss, and some examples are insulin, thyroid, estrogen and testosterone. So yes, genetics, how your body is formed, do play a part in whether you are likely to get fat anot.
But OP, do note that this is not a good reason for you to stay in the 80kg range, and that staying there does not mean that you are normal just because of your genetics and built of your body. Regardless of what, healthy is the most important and being overweight do results in a series of diseases I believe you don't want to have at this age. Losing weight is not just for finding boyfriend (tbh, i know girls who are obese and do have boyfriends, so that might not be the only factor), but rather for your health. At this age, it's easier to lose weight and as you grow, the metabolism slows down and it's even easier to gain weight and harder to lose! So don't waste the prime time:)
For people putting down her on her attitude, please try to understand her. She has her own insecurities despite putting up her strong front and saying that she love herself for who she is. No matter what, she will be affected by her friends constantly asking her to lose weight and the fact that she still doesn't have any boyfriend. She was seeking for some reassurance so she can build up on self-esteem and do something about it (not trying to say it's right or not), and when y'all start putting her down, of course she would get defensive and try to protect herself more.
So please stop doing that, good intentions or not, the way you phrase your words and the tone you put in your sentence is important. You can't tell someone what to do, but you can encourage them to do it without putting them down.

You did ask why guys never really chase you considering your physical appearance, and I guess that's what you got from the NUSWhispers commenters. You got what you asked for, lol.
It's not just guys who are superficial, though. Don't us girls have our very own guy crushes? I am someone who falls for a guy's personality rather than their looks, but I'm not ashamed to say that I can be superficial too. Girl, admit it: wouldn't you rather be talking to a stranger who's close to Benedict Cumberbatch (or [insert your male celebrity crush here]) in terms of looks rather than a stranger who looks like Napoleon Dynamite? First impressions matter, and unfortunately light travels faster than sound.
Honestly, I'm no skinny attractive bitch. I used to be overweight during my first 3 years of uni (currently sitting on the borderline). I've never really been chased during those 3 years, though some folks have remarked I was pretty cute (inb4 npnt). I had many guy friends but I was only a bro to them and nothing more. I never really thought my weight was a problem up until I had the problem of being unable to get cute clothes in my size (yeah plus sized lines exist but they weren't really my type). In the end I made up my mind to lose weight - because I wanted to, and not because I wanted to attract guys. I also wanted to lose weight because my ankles killed me back then, despite being only 60+kg.
That aside, if you're happy with your body, then that's your call. Pretty sure there's gonna be a guy out there who wouldn't mind how you look like.

I will not deal with the many things people have said. Like how guys being this, girl being that, ""you too"" argument, etc ... I'll just point out the factual errors in what you wrote.
First, and this is for everyone: fit does not mean healthy. Fit means you are capable of doing impressive feats of physical activity. Healthy means you are without disease. There have been a lot of stories of somewhat fit National Service men dropped dead after a mere 15 km routine march. They are fit, but not exactly healthy. Healthy does not mean fit either. Healthy, however, is as good as the medical technology allows you to diagnose or what you were made aware of. I know I have cardiac arrhythmia, fat accumulation in the liver, and an increased risk for stroke, only because I go for specific check ups. Many people will just continue living in blissful unawareness until one day, they just suddenly find they have high blood pressure, cancer, AIDS, or heart disease.
Second, weight, or BMI alone is one way to predict someone's health or propensity to have obesity-related diseases. It's a rather crude way, and also affected by basal level of physical activities. Someone who is overweight (as in BMI above the level recommended) but have a physically active job is healthier than someone who has the recommended BMI but a sedentary office job, and actually go to the gym. Better measurements could be: blood pressure, blood cholesterol, blood lipid, kidney function, cardiac health (by doing an ECG), and liver function (or whether you have fatty liver). My point is: get an actual checkup from a doctor. You might be surprised. We were having a Blood Pressure measuring practical once and we discovered that some of us have BP in the 120-180 range. They were normal just years ago, but fast food, stress, lack of sleep, and sedentary sent it over.
Third, some research showed that the extremely obese die first, then the extremely thin, then the ""norma"" weight, then the slightly overweight. The theory is the extra fat is useful in absorbing the stress of modern life. But then some also show that caloric restriction (70% of usual calorie intake) can extend life by 30% (in animal studies).
Fourth, most ""detox"" regimen do nothing. Your liver and kidney do all the detoxing. The only thing a ""detox"" regimen cleans out is your bank account. Stop wasting money on that and actually go for a checkup.

18564,28115,"I can actually empathize with the OP of #28025. Just that I'm a guy who is 1.60m tall. That feeling of rejection by the opposite gender simply because of my physical attributes is frustrating. I have been told right in the face that I would never be anyone's type because I'm a ""dwarf"". During one of the orientation camps, some girls stayed up to HTHT at the sleeping area. They were discussing which guys would be their ideal type. Then when they talked about me, they were like ""eeew he's too short"". Luckily I pretended to be asleep so it wasn't awkward.
To the OP of #28025, being judged just because of your physical appearance is painful... i feel you. But at least over sized girls have got moral vigilantes to watch their back when they're being discriminated against.
On the other hand, no one would call a girl superficial for disliking short guys and we're supposed to simply accept the criticism. It's not even socially acceptable or politically correct to defend a short guy for being subjected to prejudice.

Protection is the only reasonably accepted responsible safeguard. Not doing your due diligence, willfully accepting the risk, and then blaming your boyfriend is a vile manoeuvre.

20758,31685,"The recent post on potential pregnancy due to non-consentual ejaculation made me think of the wider issue of millennials not being able to think straight or simply be responsible for themselves just because they didn't get what they want. It's a very dangerous trend for society.
In the case of #31646 , just because you did not get what you want which is for your partner not to ejaculate in you, you wanna report him for rape instead of considering how it is not physiologically possible to ensure 100% safety without protection. Your first instinct is to blame the guy when you failed to be responsible for yourself by using protection.

20769,31697,"Continuing from #31646
Okay many people have slammed me on my confession, so let me clarify things first.
Both the guy and I already long had an agreement beforehand that he would pull out first before shooting his load, because I felt that raw penetration would feel better than if he had a condom on. I already was aware of the risks, and was prepared to take responsibility should I somehow end up pregnant. But I'm upset because he broke our agreement when he ejaculated inside me. I thought we had reached an agreement, yet he didn't keep to his promise.
When I realized he was going to come inside, I protested and tried to get him to pull out, but he didn't budge. He held on to me tightly and shot all of his load inside me.
Many people seem to support the notion that ""I brought it upon myself"" for ""not taking enough careful measures"" just because I gave consent to sex. Isn't that victim blaming? Does that mean that if someone did that to your sister, you'd find no fault with that guy? If you're a guy and you had a similar agreement before doing the deed, does it mean that you condone the act of breaking your promise to your girl (i.e ejaculating inside her against her will)?

I don't know if you deserve it or what, but to me; you deserve it. Is protecting yourself before any accident happens so hard? If you know you are gonna have sex, protect yourself. If you think you are gonna be sleeping around anywhere anytime then always carry condoms with you. Don't cry wolf when you allowed the wolf in. You should know by now guys will always be pushy during sex. Not that the man is right, but you are wrong to have unprotected sex. People like you contribute to unwanted pregnancies & STIs. By law, it might be considered rape. Seek a lawyer's opinion and take legal actions if you really feel violated. But bear in mind, you allowed him in. Be a smart lady, protect yourself always. Don't even try the withdrawal method. Stay safe during sex. I'm a female btw. And I strongly think fellow females have to strictly protect themselves because we girls will always be on the losing end when it comes to such things like, unwanted pregnancies; STIs aside.

20771,31699,"#31646: note to self and everyone, this is how a shitstorm happens. Someone post something asking a question, then people flock to answer. Then the people in the comment start attacking each other. Soon, it will no longer be about what was asked in the first place and given enough time, someone will be compared to Hitler.
Now that I have ironically called out what I am about to do, let me start attacking some people who replied to my comment calling me out for not reading up on existing cases. Yes I did. However, let me, a foreigner explains to you how Singapore judiciary system works. A case in Singapore is decided by a judge, who must do it according to law; or if no law exists, according to a precedent set by an equivalent or higher court of the same judiciary system. That means a case decided by another court in another country has no bearing on how a case is decided in Singapore. Though the judge ""might"" borrow the reasoning from a foreign case, or to do it for political reasons (like not making Singapore look like uncultured savages). There has been no precedent for such case in Singapore yet, so it's all up to the exact judge.
Anyway, back to the OP's case. I'm not going to pass a judgement on that, but I am about to outline a few options. Yes, you are free to go to the police. They exist for a reason. However, they might not press the charge for the case. If you get pregnant, that's perfect evidence, otherwise, where's the evidence. Another point is they may just laugh at you, may be not to your face, but behind you, and passing judgements behind your face. If the prosecutor finds no opportunity to convict, he/she will not take it on. Feel free to.
Now if you are REALLY keen on making the guy pay, there are legal counselling services for sex victims. Or you can hire your own attorneys and try to get the case through criminal court. If not a criminal case, but you get pregnant, you can always press a civil case, asking for compensations and such. But you start whining, where do I find the money (Singaporean lawyers charge you by the hour); well, we all have prices to pay.
However, I will still stand by my original judgement of your action, which has nothing to do with whether that guy raped you or not. You are still an idiot for having unprotected sex with a person with unknown STD status. You are what contribute to the statistics. Still, my advice for you is to pursue the case to the bitter end, for the same reason that I tell my American friends to look forward to a Trump presidency: ""it might be shit and horrifying for you, but for sure it's gonna being interesting and entertaining for the rest of us"".
To pre-empt people in the comment calling me a horrible, psychopathic, schadenfreude, whatever: I know that I am. And I enjoy every moment of it. And you should know also about Mr Trump and his supporters: they revel in hatred. I am not a Trump supporter but I will support the fun that comes out of his administration (I would have vote for Bernie if I could).

Typical use failure rate for withdrawal as a contraception method is more than 18-27% based on various studies. Perfect use failure rate is less than 4%. The large difference between the typical use and perfect use suggests that many guys are unable to withdraw in time. If you get into such risky acts, you should know the consequences. He is still blameworthy, but I hope you understand rape is a very serious charge and you can ascribe criminal blame one party alone for a combined stupidity. If you really want to be safe, use condoms (even they are not perfect).

20785,31720,"This is a response to #31646 and the very interesting (and heated) replies it has generated. It is heartening to see the level of interest in issues of law and the criminal justice amongst the younger generation, as should indeed be the case in a society that aspires to the rule of law.
Many of the comments have deviated into very abstract analyses and analogies, which is perhaps understandable for a community made up largely of idealistic and passionately opinionated students. However, what you must realise is that although the law may lay down rules and principles, these are applied through human agency and this has a very significant impact on the outcome.
In the scenario, it is not disputed that the girl has consented to unprotected sex; indeed, she wanted it to be unprotected for the intimacy. What she is claiming is that she did not consent to ejaculation inside her. There are two issues that follow from this:
1. Ejaculation is a natural consequence of sex. It is not inevitable, but it is natural, and ordinarily it happens in most cases. So the question is can you consent to sex but not to ejaculation? It is not reasonable; just like how you cannot consent to surfboarding while at the same time insisting you do not consent to falling in the water. Yes, you and your partner can try not to make it happen, but when you consent to engage in something you consent to the consequences that in normal circumstances would flow from it. So if consent to sex remained present at all times it is not reasonable to argue that the girl refused consent to ejaculation.
2. You could argue that the girl withdrew consent at some point during the sex. Legally, consent to sex can be withdrawn at any time and if the male proceeds thereafter, it is rape. Well and good, but ok - this is your law books end and the real world begins. Prove it. Prove that you withdrew your consent and clearly communicated your withdrawal of consent at some point during the shagging, before the ejaculation. Was there a known safeword like in BDSM that you spoke and was ignored? Do you have a recording? Do you have proof of an agreement? Do you think you will have evidence to support this, and do you think the Prosecution Service will be convinced there is enough evidence to charge (bearing in mind this was consensual sex from the beginning)? Also, are you willing to testify and face detailed cross-examination on this? These are realities that face our investigative agencies, the legal fraternity and our stakeholders every day.
In view of the two points above, may I humbly suggest that if you do not or cannot accept the natural consequences of sex, you either (a) take the necessary precautions or (b) refrain from having sex. This seems awfully obvious, but it is perhaps a sign of the times nowadays that such a simple point now needs to be explained and defended.
Analogies and arguments that stray too far from the facts disclosed by the OP are unhelpful. Nobody is saying that once consent to sex is given ""you can do anything"", or crap of that sort. This is a unique scenario where consent was given but supposedly not to one of the naturally-flowing consequences; stick to the facts. If any of you are law students, it bears repetition that (1) justice is justice according to the law, not according to the mob; and (2) the law is applied to the facts and only the facts, not what one imagines to be the facts.
Thanks for your consideration.

20787,31727,"I read with much interest the well-reasoned and thoughtful response in #31720 to the many posts about the girl who did not consent to her partner ejaculating inside of her. I'm glad to see that this important discussion about the nature of sexual consent is happening, and that it has attracted such mature and thoughtful responses. However, I must disagree with most of them (which have focused on slamming and scolding the OP in #31646). What happened to her is, morally, rape - even if the legal position is unclear. Our response should therefore not be to shame her, even if we personally think she is foolish. Let me make 3 points that follow from this. For the purposes of this discussion, let's assume that everything the OP said is true, although it is of course possible that it isn't.
1. Rape is having sex with a person (of whatever gender) without their consent. Very few people would disagree with this. What many of us have argued is that this situation is not rape, because ejaculation is a ""natural consequence"" of sex and therefore consent to unprotected sex automatically means consent to ejaculation inside of her. With respect, this is factually untrue. As a guy, I know for certain that men can control themselves and pull out when they feel like coming. If you don't believe me, just read men's websites which are filled with techniques on how to have more pleasurable orgasms by prolonging the time taken to ""come"". It is simply not true that once the guy put his penis into her, he was physiologically unable to control himself. Therefore, it was eminently reasonable for her to expect him to pull out, in fact, ""pulling-out"" was the main method of contraception before the advent of condoms and such an instance is even referenced in the biblical book of Genesis (the story of Onan, for those interested).
Some of us may say that the guy was simply careless, and should not be punished for *rape*. Morally and legally, this is an untenable position. Many things are immoral and punished severely even though they are careless, reckless or negligent acts. A good example is dangerous driving causing death. If we would not excuse a driver who killed someone out of carelessness from some sort of punishment, then similarly the man in this scenario should not be excused. Should he have a lighter punishment? Morally, I don't think so. Legally, that is for the judge to decide.
2. Second, the evidence. Many have pointed out that the allegations made by the OP would be very difficult to prove. Unfortunately, this is true. However, that doesn't mean that it isn't wrong, it shouldn't be a crime or that it shouldn't be prosecuted. Almost all sexual crimes are very difficult to prove, because most rapes are not committed by random strangers in the street but by acquaintances. That doesn't mean we stop trying to stop rape or start blaming the victims.
Some may be curious as to the legal position on this issue. To my knowledge, the Singapore courts have not dealt with such a case before. Should it come before them, my own view is that it would be considered rape. Several other jurisdictions have ruled that similar cases are rape, most notably this position has been taken in England, which Singapore often follows closely (for those interested, the case to read is Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority).
3. Finally, victim blaming. Most of the responses so far have focused on blaming the OP for being foolish and stupid, or on saying that she ""should have known"". This is a wrong, and dangerous response. True, she may have in fact been foolish. But our *focus* should not be on blaming women for being foolish, but on teaching both men and women to control themelves, be responsible for their own urges and respect other people's wishes. This line of thought is what will help society fight sexual assault instead of encouraging people to view women as the only ones responsible for their own safety. Again, I'm not saying that women (or anyone) should not take care of themselves. I'm saying that society should *focus* on righting the wrong and punishing the offender (as it does with robbery, murder, etc) rather than telling victims to be more careful (as people tend to do with sexual assault).
Have a great day everyone!

Although I am on your side, unlike that troll who keeps pasting the same article on every single confession related to this, I am actually going to give you some advice on what's your next step, and hopefully you will be able to find something that can help you.
Give up on trying to sue him. Before you switch off, hear me out first. Let's be honest, this is not a typical rape case, hence your chance of winning is pretty low. Plus, by now all the evidence is probably gone and it's just a ""he say she say"" situation. Not mentioning the amount of money you need to waste on filing a lawsuit.. Etc. (I am no lawyer sorry but I know it's expensive)
With that out of the way.. What are your next steps? It's too late for morning after pill so don't even need to get that anymore. Get yourself a pregnancy test, if it comes out positive, get an abortion pill. If you don't want the baby, don't drag it, so that you won't need to have a surgery. If you want to keep it, I think you know what to do. If it's negative, then good for you, it's a lesson learnt.
I think you know you made a wrong decision (casual sex, sex without protection), and I am pretty sure that you will never forget this lesson or be careless again. Everyone makes mistakes, it's okay. But don't waste your energy on something that's not worth it, and will only bring more pain to yourself (everyone - even more people than right now, is gonna question you and blame you the moment you make yourself public with the story). Your focus should be taking care of yourself, remember the lesson learnt, and think of what's the next step from here.

35924,55982,"Regarding recent posts about girls having multiple sex partners and fwb, I feel worried that girls are trying to make it seem normal.. Allow me to give you my opinion on why having multiple sex partner is bad...
1. It shows that you have low moral value. Sleeping around shows that you are a loose person with low self control and desire instant gratification. Different people have different level of moral standard. Just because you have low moral level (and feel multiple sex partner is not wrong) doesn’t mean others should drop down to your level and approve your action. We uphold our moral code and can jolly well judge you based on our own expectation of a morally decent person. If you really don’t feel it is wrong, you should announce to everyone about your history and be proud about your “achevement” right? Why nobody does it? Ans: Because deep inside, you know it is wrong
2. Notice how the posts always say “fwb or multiple sex partners is not wrong” instead of “fwb or multiple sex partners is right”. This shows that even they know the action is not something positive that should be advocated, hence they don’t dare to say it’s right. The next best thing is to make it seem that their action is not something negative. Hence they try to strike a neutral position and say it is not wrong to have multiple partners. Can I ask you, why do you defend something so fevertly when it is not even something positive? And when people disagree, you call them narrow minded, judgemental and disrespectful.
3. The posts always like to say
“It’s my own body and I can do whatever I like”. Yes, I agree that you definitely have the autonomy to do whatever you want. But having autonomy doesn’t equate to whether something is right or wrong. Autonomy just means you have a CHOICE. Having a choice doesn’t automatically mean your choice cannot be judged or critiqued by other people. So, stop using autonomy to justify your action. Based on your low moral value, it doesn’t seem bad to you. But to a person with high moral values, your action is deemed morally bad. Basically, it just means the 2 person are morally incompatible. Hence, please don’t force your bf to adopt your low moral standard or worse still, call your bf “narrow minded, traditional or don’t deserve your love”. Just go find someone with lower moral value like you.
In conclusion, having fwb or multiple sex partner is morally wrong and should be confined. Shaming and judging this type of action is not about being disrespectful, rude or offensive. Instead, it is about serving a deterrence to educate our future generations that this type of action is morally wrong and should be frowned upon.

35943,56030,"Tbh i am glad a post like #55982 showed up because those recent posts diminished further hopes of finding people with the same values as me with regards to intercourse. Believe me when I say I come from a place of love. I do have friends who done it before marriage and have not judged them. we just have different principles and that is completely fine because you alone determine what sex means to you. Simply for pleasure? Holds not much significance? That's cool.
To me though, I believe in saving myself for the person who is going to stay with me till my very last breath (unless that person goes first hoho) because sex to me solely means ""making love"" (it can have various meanings for different people la) and I think it's a beautiful intimate act that should be exclusive to the one person you are definitely going to spend the rest of your life with. Not just that, sex is scientifically like a lock. It bonds you emotionally to the person (I read somewhere that a guy's DNA will forever be in your body when you have intercourse. Not sure if it's true but I would only want to have one person's DNA inside me and that one person best be my spouse. How neat is it to have only his/her DNA on you when you are without him/her? He/she is literally always with you and going to be a part of you.)
Again, i am not here to criticise those whose principles/beliefs are different from mine, but I want to assure a small/big group of people who are saving themselves for marriage that you can still find someone with the same belief. Chances might be slim but it is still possible. However, I would not encourage you to limit your dating circle to virgins only because what ultimately matters is the person. Does his/her values towards sex/love/other factors (almost) align with yours? Does he/she do it for love or pleasure (not mutually exclusive btw)? Then that is good enough. I have grown to embrace the possibility that my future spouse would not be a virgin. Even though it seems like everyone is doing it, don't let society pressure you into doing something against your own beliefs. And even if my future spouse did not save himself/herself for me, at least you saved yourself for him/her! It may seem like a very traditional value, but this is just what sex and love means to me: saving yourself for that one person who will be the one who would walk through with you throughout life's smallest and greatest moments. It makes the activity even more special because it is something solely shared between the two of you.
Food for thought: There's this argument on how you need to ""train""??? JUST PRACTICE TOGETHER AFTER MARRIAGE LAH.
To those who feel offended by this, please dont. We just have different beliefs and that is completely fine! You will/have found your group of people and I hope I'll be lucky enough to find mine.

35947,56043,"I’m the poster of #55982 condemning girls with fwb. I’m disappointed to see so many criticism (mostly invalid and ridiculous). I just want to address on some of the comments and elaborate a bit more on my points.
1. No, I’m not from the 1800s. I’m a current NUS undergrad just like most of you. I’m amused how people always like to associate immoral acts such as fwb, casual sex, one night stand etc with era and time. It doesn’t even make any sense! What are you trying to get across? Fwb, causal sex etc are the so-called “in things” nowadays? It’s just a pathetic attempt to divert the point.
2. Who puts me on this position of high horse? Ans: my ethics and morality. I’m doing this for the sake of humanity because being morally upright is a public good with positive externality. Although I have no authority to teach you how to live (you can jolly well live a screwed up life if you want), I’m here to shed light on how to live a good life.
Below are for the more educated people addressing moral philosophy. Please don’t read if you cant grasp:
3. Some asked me to define morality and what moral framework I am using. I’m using the virtue theory of ethics. I assume people want to lead a good and flourishing life. In order to do that, you need to strive to be virtuous. There are 4 cardinal virtues, namely wisdom, courage, temperance and justice. Fwb violates the virtue temperance and hence it’s a vice. You can go on and on in an infinite regress of asking why (eg. Why these are the virtues and not others? Why must I follow virtue theory? Or even: why I must lead a good and flourishing life etc). If you want to go down this philosophical circus of asking why, then so be it, you can never attain eudaimonia.
In conclusion, girls out there... learn to be virtuous and love yourself. Don’t be tainted by the vices. It will just make you look cheap. Purity and virtuous are among the most valuable intangible assets a girl can have. Don’t destroy it with your hands.
I dont have time to address why guys are not upheld to the same standard. It’s really obvious and I believe I don’t have to elaborate. But if you all really don’t get it.. sound out and I’ll elaborate when I got time.

Hello fellow fwb hater. I see you are a person who is trying to help others by showing them what is good and what is bad. That is very admirable.
1. To clarify, in your most recent post, I cannot be sure if you are not from the 1800s, because I see time travel as very possible, probably as much as you see fwb as being morally bad. But you are correct, what does it matter if you are from the 1800s or not?
2. You answered that it is your ethics and morality that puts you on a high horse to teach others. That is also agreeable, since a science teacher has a ""right"" to teach science, and so virtuous person such as yourself has the right to teach virtue. I would like to point out however, that to think yourself as better than most people you have not met is a vice in itself, and you should be cautious not to be led astray. Please remain within the sex-field where you are an expert in.
3. There are many virtue ethics theory, and I am not too sure which you are using. You clearly have avoided piety despite it being one of the ""original"" 5 virtues but I do think piety is very important to us and possibly your argument. You may want to reconsider bringing piety back into your life to become a more virtuous person. Also, fwb would not really be a violation of temperance (it is the uncontrolled act that makes it a violation, not the actual status of it itself). I believe you would agree with me and say that fwb is morally wrong (even if you only do it once or twice), in which case may I propose that it is a violation of piety and wisdom? I don't think I need to elaborate further because it's really obvious (you may see below for what I mean by this phrase). Furthermore, ""going down this philosophical circus of asking why"" was one of the ways we eventually got to virtue ethics. So please do not overlook the method.
I would like to ask why guys are not upheld to the same standard. ""It's really obvious"" is a very poor argument. See I could argue that the position of my remote control need not be said to every visitor to my house, because it is really obvious (IT REALLY IS!), but that tells another person nothing about where the remote control really is (it's in a basket filled with other remote controls in the centre of the living room).
All in all, feel free to express your belief that fwb and having multiple sex partners is morally wrong. We gotta do what's best for us moral people.

Hello #55982, thank you for your insight. I am a guy and I feel ashamed of myself for having fwb too. However, there are times where I am unable to control myself and indulge in lust. I agree that girls with fwb and casual sex are not morally right. This applies to guys as well and I feel ashamed because I have constantly been in 2 fwb relationship for 16 years since secondary school. I do not deem myself as good-looking or fit.
When I met my ex-girlfriend and be honest with her, I told her that I have been with 2 fwb for past 13 years. We have a hard start in relationship and gladly she was understanding and forgave me. However, we still break up in the end because of character mis-match. Truly enough, the whole aim in relationship is not about considering one past or not but is to be able to live with one another, to tolerate each other nonsense and even silence between each other feels good, because being together is to enjoy each other presence. Sometimes, when I look back, why do we even bother wasting time having a bad start when ultimately we still broke up due to character mis-match and not because of my fwb. So to all those couple having a similar start as me, it does not really matter you had fwb or multiple partners. Most importantly is whether you are able to live with that person comfortably or not!
Back to the topic, after reading your post #55982 and #56043, I feel so immorally wrong every time I am with my fwb. I am a guy and I have my needs. Sometimes, we even went to 3P. To #55982, I need your advice greatly. I do not mind disclosing the identities of fwb because I think you have it too. The 2 fwb I have are my right hand and my left hand. I am sure you have it too. I am confused…For the sake of humanity, can you please educate me on this? From your 2 posts, I think your moral values and ethical beliefs did not allow you to indulge in such act too!

35962,56070,"Chiming in on the whole thing about fwb/sex before marriage.
Personally i'm someone who's had sex with a handful of girls (all my exes). The sex was great and all, but I have to agree with #55982 that a lot of the gratification is short-lived. Even right after the sex, there's the usual post-coital tristesse. The 'reward' is mostly confined to before and during intercourse.
Having tasted the joys (if you will) of sex and also now the fulfillment of being in an abstinent long-term relationship, I actually regret not staying a virgin till after marriage. I've never encountered anyone who deems lack of sexual experience as a dealbreaker. At worst, it's seen as an inconvenience to the more experienced partner. On the other hand, I can totally see why a person who's a virgin will feel bothered by someone who's had sexual history. My current girlfriend of 3 years is rather conservative and although she's kinky in private, often times going off on that tangent, she's clear about wanting to remain a virgin till after marriage. She initially thought I was a virgin as well. I wanted to be totally honest with her so I spilled the beans as soon as I mustered the courage. Knowing that we both liked each other already by then, it pained me to watch her deal with the shock of that information. She accepted me in the end, but I know she's still slightly bothered by it. It simply would've been better if I were a virgin as well.
Based off me and my peers' experience, i'd say that having a sexual history reduces one's eligible dating pool (with virgins). I also find that girls who are more 'traditional', 'backward', '1800s' w/e have more desirable qualities that guys would seek in someone they intend to marry and settle down with. Most likely the reverse is true as well--with voluntary virgins, that is; not too sure about bitter incels lol.
Power to those who want to bang everything that moves; it's a personal choice after all. But if the intention is to one day settle down in a long-term monogamous relationship with a view to marriage and kids, then I think the odds of finding and retaining a suitable partner for that goal would be higher if one refrains from pre-marital sex. In the meantime, just grab your dick and double click.

35970,56078,"I’m the poster of #55982 and #55063 condemning girls having fwb. I’m disappointed with the comments yet again (albeit some are reasonable points and I’m addressing them below). Please don’t comment if you don’t have a point to make and all you do is name calling and giving sinister remarks (eg. One post just comment “TLDR”. Seriously? What an useful comment, trying to attract attention?) I’m here to advise girls on self love, moral value and chastity. There’s an urgent need to fix our tattered moral fabrics.
Sorry I’m gonna ignore all the useless comments and address a few key issues that surfaced:
1. Stop mentioning about causing harm! John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism and principle of harm is an absurd moral framework don’t you see it? Let me enlighten you: eg. Let’s say cheating with another man when you are married is morally wrong (if you don’t even agree with this, then you are really morally incorrigible). However, what if you are so good at cheating such that your husband can never find out? According to your harm principle logic, the act will miraculously become moral because there will only be harm if you get found out (eg. Husband feel hurt, parents feel disappointed etc). Basically, it is echoing “you can cheat as long as you don’t get caught”. It’s so superficial and absurd. Furthermore, I’m not even using utilitarian framework, why do you insist that you only ascribe to utilitarianism and ask me for harm mechanism?
2. Consequentialism is also a ridiculous framework (for goodness sake, please wiki on it if you don’t know prior to commenting, if not you will just look shallow). Why? For example, you are married and has sex with another man because he drugged you. If based on consequentialism, you are no different from a cheater because the final outcome is that you had sex with another man when you are married. It’s so absurd!! The framework failed to account for intention, ie. Good intention that lead to bad (due to bad luck etc) outcome will be deemed bad.
3. Postmodern ethic is even more absurd. It adopts moral relativism and everything depends on context and culture. At its bare foundation, it’s basically power, linguistic game intertwined with cowardice to take a stand on moral issues. Basically, everything become subjective and opinion. Seriously?
Some people may not grasp what I mean, I’ll elaborate a bit more clearly. Tom like strawberry ice cream and Daniel like chocolate ice cream. These are called OPINION and PREFERENCES. Postmodern ethic is basically attempting to change all rights and wrongs into subjective opinion and preferences just like how Tom can’t say Daniel is right or wrong to like chocolate ice cream (eg. Fwb is personal preference. It’s subjective whether casual sex is wrong.) Whether extramarital affair and incest is right or wrong will also become merely preference and subjective opinion.
Can you imagine how dangerous and chaotic the world will become if everything is subjective? There will be no objective right or wrong or truth. Everybody can disagree on everything and nobody will be right or wrong because there’s no judge or benchmark. Is that what you want when you encourage people not to be judgy? Refusal to stand up against wrong vices such as fwb, and sugarcoat it into personal preference and opinion so that you won’t offend anyone is a classic example of cowardance. The society is getting too fixated on criticising judgy behavior to the point that principles and values are eroding.
Do you all see the problem? Morality cannot be subjective and change based on context, time, or culture. If you think it will, then you have not truly grasp what morality is because you are merely talking about social norm and socially acceptability. Morality is so different from social norm for goodness sake.
So what’s the fundamental philosophical issue here? Ans: there needs to be some form of moral GROUNDING and anchor in order to have objectivity. Virtue ethic is the grounding and anchor for human flourishing. Some comments questioned why virtue ethic is the best? Why these virtue and not others etc.. The key is: you cannot question why!! Why not? Ans: because it is the fundamental axiom. What is an axiom? Axiom is an irreducible primary. It doesn't rest upon anything in order to be valid, and it cannot be proven by any ""more basic"" premises.
We need axiom because if not, we will run into the infinite regress problem. Eg. What is human made of - cell. What is cell made of - atoms. What is atoms made of - proton, neutron and electrons. What is proton made of - quark. What is quark made of - dark matter. What is dark matter made of? Do you see the problem? You can ask “what” infinitely and it will never end. That means there must be some irreducible primary that cannot be questioned even further and that is axiom.
Examples of axiom are: Parallel lines can never meet. Probability can only range from 0-1. Do you question them? You don’t!! Because they are self evident and are irreducible primary!! It will be insane if you say to your math teacher these are dogma!!
Virtue is similar to “parallel lines dont intersect and probability range from 0-1”. It is an irreducible primary axiom of moral philosophy that is self evident and cannot be questioned, but it is NOT a dogma. You cannot question the cardinal virtues because they are inherent good, ie. the essence is good and you can’t doubt that the essence of virtue is bad. You can resort to intellectual dishonesty or play verbal games by twisting virtue into bad things (eg. coining terms such as “fwb virtue” or “wisdom of murder”), that will just make you look childish.
All right... this is not a philosophy classroom and I don’t want to bombard layman with things they can’t grasp, it will just bore them out.
I just wanna say, I am currently attached for 2 years and neither me nor my gf have any tainted fwb history (hence I’m certainly not an incel nor some desperate horny guy). In fact, I broke up with a girl before she wanna have sex with me before marriage.
I’m amused that a lot people are annoyed by my superior and holier-than-thou attitude. Because you know what? I don’t even see myself as superior or holier. I’m just a normal person. The fact that you feel I’m holier is because your reference point of “moral normality” is so low such that you feel I’m holier.
Girls... please stop lowering the moral benchmark even more. If not, nude women walking on street might be the new “morality” in future. Don’t be used by men, please!

Public resources can be and should be better used, especially when they are limited.
Routine seat ""chopers"", Singaporeans or not, think of this ubiquitous slogan next time you are up to ""chope"" a seat: LETS BE CONSIDERATE.

Guten Tag.
I've been on exchange in Germany before (Uni Heidelberg). I've got my culture shock too when I was there. I was seating at an empty seat where there were some books on the other side of a medium sized table, nobody was there then, in the university library. But when that student came back, she, a caucasian, said in German that she reserved the whole table, and shooed me away.
Despite this incident, I don't put labels to the local culture and judge them using my own cultural values. If you intend to go to other parts of the world to open your eyes, then you have to be prepared for things that are not what you are not in alignment with your values. As an exchange student, I don't know why you are judging us by calling us ""really selfish"". This is not the open-mindedness Germans claim to embrace (die Aufgeschlossenheit). Entitled much? But then that's the attitude of the majority of young Germans I came across during my year there.

3) locals would rather petition to save dogs (instead of refugees)

Allow me state the obvious - You are decreasing the total number of seats while you queue for your food. If no one reserves seats, more seats will be filled with people consuming their meal, and moving off after they are done. It is less likely that there will be a shortage of seats, even though the lunch crowd population is constant each day.
Reserving seats is inconsiderate, and comparing this practice with bad practices from other countries does not make it any less inconsiderate. Any sufficiently large group of humans will have good and bad practices, and correspondingly, good and bad people. I think it is time to get rid of this bad practice.

To guys, a girl can't get pregnant without your sperms. The kid may not be in your body, but you still contributed to the creation of the kid. Go to the clinic with the girl, split the abortion fee, be there with the girl even after the abortion, just go through it together because it's the two of you who made the mistake.
To girls, the kid is in you, you can't run away from the responsibilities even if you want to. So don't be delusional and say things like 'you got me pregnant!' You can't be pregnant if you don't agree to the sex. It's right to get your fwb to be responsible for it, but not fully responsible. If the guy is there with you throughout the whole journey, be thankful that you are not going through it alone.
But honestly, if you have a kid, time is crucial. Get it over and done with and quarrel about responsibility later. If you two can't handle the responsibility issue now, you definitely do not want the child to grow bigger to the point where you can't have an abortion and have to talk about another form of responsibility. And if you don't feel old and mature enough to handle such responsibilities, don't get fwbs.

Honestly, that's the first question any fkboy would ask, but ya I guess I count as one.
From experience, most of the time when I have fwbs, they have other fwbs on the side too. NSA also means you guys are not exclusively banging each other, and usually that means multiple partners la.
Just want you to be sure so you don't end up paying for some other dude's ""accident"".
To all the SJWs out there, don't be so quick to jump on the dude. I nearly got the abortion pinned on me before. I'm medically sterile, can't have kids. But I'll still strongly advise you to use condoms cause risk of STI is real even if you're sterile too y'know.
She tried to pin it on me anyway, claiming that I'm her only fwb, and she only had sex with me. Constantly insisting that she doesn't have any other fwb, until I told her I was sterile, and then she finally fessed up to having other guys but that they wouldn't pay.
In this case I don't think it's fair for me to pay up, if I was responsible for the accident yeah, I'd split the cost 50/50, but that's just a theory since I can't have kids anyway. So for yall, stop judging the poor dude with only like 25% of the story. He might not even be the father for all we know, and you're just gonna blindly ascribe responsibility to him just cause the girl's accusing him. It's this kinda shit that ruined MeToo, cause we jumped on people just cause someone said so, not even making sure that the story was correct in the first place.
You wanna go on a witchhunt, be sure of it first. Most of the dudes caught under MeToo I'd say deserved it very much, but I'm not sure about some of them and that just sours the movement some.
If you ask me, yall should be calling for them to split the damn bill and share the responsibility, not banging the PC view that the man must take responsibility... as if the girl can't make her own decisions. It's 2019, since we want gender equality, start by splitting responsibilities more fairly.
